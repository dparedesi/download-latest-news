Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will open the conference and participate in a closed roundtable discussion with institutional investors, followed by a discussion with Morgan Stanley representatives Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will open the conference and participate in a closed roundtable discussion with institutional investors, followed by a discussion with Morgan Stanley representatives. The investors in Athens are awaiting the prime minister’s official position when asked about the rumors that have circulated in Athens’ stock exchange offices about possible taxation of banks’ profits, a fact that seems to be denied by sources close to the prime minister. The prime minister will be accompanied in London by the head of his Economic Office, Alexis Patellis, who will also participate in a discussion with Morgan Stanley analysts. Within the framework of the two-day conference, three thematic panel discussions will also be held that will focus on Greek banks, the energy sector and the Athens Stock Exchange. The Greek government is placing great emphasis on developing policies that are pro-investment and an environment that will be attractive to strong international capital. The government’s aim is to restructure and strengthen the domestic stock market in order to support and develop businesses through the smooth flow of capital. Foreign funds are expected to show particular interest in energy companies, especially with regard to the country’s transition to a lower-emissions mix. Greece has relied on lignite for decades, while the transition has been implemented over the last two decades, through a mix of natural gas, wind farms and photovoltaics. The meetings with international institutional investors that will be held during the two days of the Roadshow (one-to-one & group meetings) will be attended by high-ranking executives from the following listed companies: IPTO, Aegean Airlines, Alpha Bank, EXAE, Athens International Airport, EYDAP, AustriaCard, Autohellas, Avax, Bank of Cyprus, Cenergy Holdings, Coca Cola HBC, Ellaktor, Eurobank, Fourlis, GEK Terna, Terna Energy, OPAP, OTE, Helleniq Energy, Intrakat, Intralot, KRI KRI, Lamda Development, METLEN, Motor Oil, National Bank, Optima bank, Piraeus Bank, Piraeus Port Authority, Profile, PPC, Sarantis, Titan, Trade Estates, Viohalco, ElvalHalcor and Noval Properties. The HELEX event in London is an institution that began in 2006. The biggest names in institutional companies worldwide are expected to participate. These include BlackRock, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Fidelity Management & Research, Goldman Sachs, GSO, Hamblin Watsa Investments Council, Invesco, JP Morgan, One Investments, Schroders, Soros Fund Management, Stewart Investors, Trowe Price, TT International and Wellington. The leading international funds will request information on the course of reforms (especially in the judicial system), as well as on the progress of investments within the framework of the Recovery Fund.

Title: The powerlessness of Germany’s next chancellor

Friedrich Merz wants to make Germany great again, but his country is confronting global risks beyond the control of any domestic leader. BERLIN ― Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, is campaigning on his own version of MAGA, vowing to restore his country’s lost sense of greatness in profoundly insecure times. But given the immense global challenges that Germany now confronts, from industrial decline to war in Europe, Merz may find himself virtually powerless to realize his nostalgic vision of restoring economic growth and a sense of security. “Europe and the world should once again look at Germany with admiration and not with bewilderment,” Merz said in a video message after announcing his candidacy for the chancellor role earlier this year. “I will put all my strength,” he added, into building “a Germany that we can be proud of again.” Merz and his conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) appear set to assume power within months following the November collapse of Germany’s left-leaning three-party coalition. With an early election slated for Feb. 23, Germany’s conservatives are far ahead in the polls on 32 percent support. That puts Merz, a 69-year-old corporate lawyer by trade, on the cusp of fulfilling his longtime dream of becoming chancellor. He could scarcely have imagined, however, that his dream would come true at a time of such peril for Europe — and for Germany in particular. The country is facing vexing economic and political woes while the EU confronts its own array of difficulties — among them the threat of a new debt crisis emanating from France; a rising far right; Russian sabotage and influence operations; and an escalating war in Ukraine. With Germany’s economic engine sputtering and its politics increasingly fractured by the rise of radical parties, Berlin simply lacks the strength to lead Europe out of the morass. The problem for Merz is that despite his ambition and the likelihood of a clear governing mandate, Germany is now uniquely vulnerable to global events beyond the immediate control of any national leader. For decades, the country’s security and prosperity have relied on three pillars: a U.S. defense guarantee; virtually unfettered international trade, allowing its export-oriented economy to flourish; and cheap energy from Russia to bolster German industry. As Merz prepares to take up the reins and vows to lead Germany in a fundamentally new direction, the country lacks a sweeping vision to replace those outmoded pillars. Merz has outlined a conservative vision for how he’ll govern. He plans to cut welfare benefits, sharply reduce the number of asylum-seekers coming to Germany, cut regulations to incentivize more private investment, and make military spending a higher budget priority while maintaining fiscal discipline. But it’s unclear whether those policies, even if realized, would suffice to meet the monumental challenges Germany now faces. Merz’s core mission is to undo the legacy of Angela Merkel, his CDU predecessor who served as chancellor for 16 years. After winning a party power struggle with Merz in 2002, Merkel effectively exiled him from the CDU leadership. After years on the political sidelines, Merz left the German parliament to go into business, eventually chairing the German arm of U.S. investment fund BlackRock. But as Merkel drew the CDU toward the center and allowed more than a million asylum-seekers to enter Germany during the refugee crisis of 2015, Merz and other right-wing conservatives quietly stewed. Merkel’s centrism, they believed, had opened up room on Germany’s political spectrum for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) — currently the second strongest party in the country, according to polls. Shortly after the 2021 election that brought Chancellor Olaf Scholz to power, CDU members overwhelmingly elected Merz to lead the party, cementing his political comeback and drawing the party back to the right. Merz’s sharp-tongued and sometimes populist rhetoric also represents a significant break from the reserved tones of Scholz and Merkel. German voters don’t seem particularly fond of him — other conservative politicians are more popular, according to surveys — but Merz, his party colleagues say, is still the right person for the job. “Friedrich Merz is not really very beloved, but he is respected,” said Günther Oettinger, a former senior CDU politician and European commissioner. “He doesn’t win over the hearts of the people. But the situation in Germany is difficult. We’re in a recession. We have an unsolved migration problem. We’re losing competitiveness. We have a failed energy transition. People now need a restorer. And that’s exactly his profile.” CDU politicians also believe that Merz’s brand of conservativism and blunt style will position him far better to deal with Donald Trump, who harbored a particular antipathy toward Merkel and Germany during his first term as U.S. president. Merz also believes he’ll be able to stand up to Trump far better than Scholz. “Trump will drop you like a lightweight,” Merz told the left-leaning chancellor in a recent parliamentary debate. The question is whether Merz would fare any better in his dealings with the next American president. In both economic and security terms, Trump’s return poses a unique existential threat to Germany. At a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin is increasing his assaults on Ukraine and conducting a hybrid war on Europe, Trump has repeatedly assailed Germany for being “delinquent” on defense spending. Earlier this year he said he had encouraged Moscow to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that “don’t pay.” The president-elect has also threatened to withdraw U.S. military support for Ukraine, a move that would leave Europe on the hook even as Germany’s intelligence agency warns the Kremlin is preparing for the possibility of a “direct military confrontation with NATO.” Trump’s threats to slap tariffs on European goods could hit Germany’s export-oriented industrial sector particularly hard in the midst of an economic contraction that is seeing factory closures and mass layoffs. The Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research estimates that future tariffs could cost Germany €33 billion, and that exports to the U.S. could drop by 15 percent. Merz has vowed to stand up to Trump by advocating Germany’s foreign policy interests more assertively. When it comes to the details, however, Merz has offered only vague promises to meet the next American president “with an upright posture and clarity,” and a willingness to cut “deals.” Merz has suggested he will buy American weapons in order to please Trump, while CDU politicians say they will urge the president-elect to forgo tariffs on Europe by arguing that free trade between the EU and the U.S. makes sense if both want to reduce their dependence on China. “Let’s rather facilitate transatlantic trade, as we have a common challenge to reduce our economic dependencies on China, especially in the area of raw materials and critical infrastructure,” said Thomas Silberhorn, a conservative Bavarian politician, summarizing the arguments Merz will make. “For us to succeed, we must become stronger in transatlantic trade and not weaken each other.” Still, Germany remains at the mercy of Trump’s decisions. After decades of post-Cold War disarmament, its army is incapable of fighting an extended war, and even in 2023 Berlin spent only 1.5 percent of GDP on defense ($66.8 billion). Meanwhile, convincing Trump of the benefits of free trade, if only with Europe, seems a long shot given that tariffs are the basis of the U.S. president-elect’s economic agenda. Merz still insists Germany can thrive despite the global challenges. “We have to go from being a sleeping middle power to a leading middle power again,” he told German magazine Stern. But as the world returns to great-power rivalry and Europe suffers from broader political and economic weakness, Germany’s fate as a middle power may largely rest on forces beyond its borders. It’s a particularly bad time for Berlin to be experiencing political paralysis pending formation of a new government. The U.S. president’s visit to Berlin comes at a time of particular peril for Kyiv. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s move to establish new border controls risks generating an EU rift. The far-right Alternative for Germany party won the Thuringia state election, dealing a blow to the country’s coalition government.

Title: Local Bitcoin funds record returns of 30%
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2912405/local-bitcoin-funds-record-returns-of-30-
Time Published: 2024-12-02T02:38:00Z

Two Thai Bitcoin mutual funds have posted returns reaching 30% following their launches in June, drawing demand from investors as prices continue to spike, approaching US$100,000 following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. Only two asset management companies -- One Asset Management (ONEAM) and MFC Asset Management (MFC) -- have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch mutual funds investing in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The SEC restricted investment in mutual funds tied to spot Bitcoin ETFs to institutional investors and ultra-accredited investors (UI) because of the high risks associated with cryptocurrencies and digital assets. These investors are required to have extensive knowledge and the capacity to manage significant investment risks. The world's largest cryptocurrency rose 0.9% to $95,964 on Friday, with analysts expecting the price to reach $100,000 later this year. One of the funds is ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds Unhedged (not for retail investors), with a ticker of ONE-BTCETFOF-UI, launched by ONEAM on June 6. The fund has diversified investments in several master funds, including Franklin Bitcoin ETF (50.6% of the portfolio), iShares Bitcoin Trust Fund (38.4%) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (10.5%). Total assets as of Nov 26 amounted to 327 million baht. Pote Harinasuta, chief executive of ONEAM, said ONE-BTCETFOF-UI achieved returns of more than 30%, mirroring the performance of its master funds. "Investor interest has surged as Bitcoin reached all-time highs, driven by Trump's pro-Bitcoin policies," he said. Investing in digital assets through regulated mutual funds offers benefits such as exemption from withholding tax and reliable asset custody by SEC-regulated management companies. This makes such funds a safer and more secure option than non-regulated platforms, said Mr Pote. MFC Bitcoin ETF Tracker Fund (not for retail investors), with a ticker of MBTCETF-UI, invests in Bitcoin ETFs, particularly through iShares Bitcoin Trust, managed by BlackRock, the world's largest ETF provider. Chaovakorn Chotibunt, executive vice-president and head of investment strategy at MFC, said MBTCETF-UI delivered a return of roughly 30% since its inception on June 7. As of Nov 23, iShares Bitcoin Trust yielded a return of 99%, while Bitcoin itself delivered a 134% return. Mr Chaovakorn attributed the price surge to market speculation driven by Trump's policies, which have created optimism about Bitcoin's potential roles in the financial system. Based on rising demand, MFC expanded MBTCETF-UI's registered asset size from 2 billion baht to 5 billion on Nov 14. As of Nov 27, the fund's net asset value reached 2.5 billion baht. "Bitcoin and digital assets are alternative investments with very high risks," he said. "We generally recommend allocating only 1% of your portfolio to this segment, or an amount aligned with your risk tolerance." Younger investors show more interest in digital assets, while some investors are turning to Bitcoin because of concerns about the US dollar's stability, said Mr Chaovakorn.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Depending on where you live, Cyber Monday may already be over. However, many businesses operate with Pacific time in mind, even if they're located elsewhere. That means several sales are still running, but only an hour remains before the Cyber Monday deals all expire. Most deals end at midnight PT, but some discounts have already expired, from what I can see. If you've been unable to shop this week's deals, this last hour is your final window to score the best savings of 2024. After this, there are no more sales coming until next year. After hours of filtering through thousands of deals all month long, our team of experienced deal hunters has gathered the very best discounts on products we love, below. Skip the hunting and keep scrolling to check out deals that you can trust. The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Max is a premium service for fans of prestige television, iconic films, and unscripted programs like Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Succession, House of the Dragon, The Last of Us, and more. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but a special Cyber Monday promo has lowered the price to $2.99 monthly for six months. Otherwise, you're looking at $17 for ad-free and $21 if you want to view in 4K. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. Monthly fees are usually $7.99, but the current Cyber Monday promo slashes that price down to $1.99 for six months on the ad-supported tier. Or you can go for a year at just $20. Offer expires December 2. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99. That's plenty of time to enjoy a rich collection of sitcoms, movies, and live events. Offer expires December 2. Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime. A new promotion sees the monthly fee knocked down to $2.99 for a couple of months. Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. For the next two months, though, you get this tier for just $2.99 a month, which is a great opportunity to make your way through a few shows with no irritating ads - of which there are many on the ad-supported tier. The Starz streaming service offers several original shows and classic movies. The semi-annual plan is a steal compared to a standard month-to-month subscription. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Casper has redesigned its classic hybrid mattress into the Dream, which offers a medium-firm feel that sleeps cool and has zone support. While we haven't tested it yet, the Nectar Premier is designed to be a step up in comfort from the Classic, which we love. At under $1,000, it's the brand's most popular model. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The memory foam of the Bear mattress, combined with Celliant technology, makes this a great bed for active folks looking for some rest and recovery. Apply code BFCM4TY to save 40% off at checkout, and get free pillows, instead of the automatically applied deal. The Big Fig Mattress is constructed for heavier individuals with firm support and a high weight capacity. The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation. The Scuba is a crowd-favorite style from lululemon, and this version has a roomy, oversized fit alongside the style's signature fleecy fabric. This simple knit is made with a blend of recycled and virgin cashmere. It comes in five colorways. "Jenni Kayne's cashmere sweaters are a splurge for sure, but this one is the best luxury-grade cardigan I've tried," writes associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. “Upon feeling the soft material, I knew that the piece was quality and would hold up after more than just a few wears and washes,” says freelance reporter Olivia Rose Rushing. “I was surprised at just how comfy it was — especially since I was able to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking.” This pushup bra uses a super-soft sheen microfiber fabric with extra-compressive side wings for a smoothing effect. It’s designed to be invisible under clothing. Featuring a sumptuous sherpa collar, an asymmetrical closure, and a soft leather construction, this trend-forward jacket will keep you warm all season long, sans sacrificing style. With 700-fill power, responsibly-sourced goose down, a water-repellent and wind-resistant fabric, and a removable hood, this cropped puffer will keep you warm all through winter. It comes in 11 colors. “I’ve been buying Abercrombie & Fitch winter coats for years, and I’ve never been disappointed in a purchase," says freelance writer Talia Ergas. "The Ultra Puffer turned out to be everything I hoped for. The puffiness is balanced nicely by the short silhouette and luxurious faux fur accents. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out.” This soft, smooth raschel fleece jacket is lightweight and insulating. Plus, it's made from 100% recycled materials. There’s no time like the present to layer up in a seriously cozy flannel shirt jacket. Complete with a quilted lining, it’s a perfectly rugged layer atop a thermal shirt on brisk winter mornings. Turn back the clock with this throwback rugby shirt, a Ralph Lauren staple for decades that looks as great now as it did back in the day. This cozy knit is a versatile layering piece thanks to its breathable cotton construction. While it’s a men’s sweater, many of our female editors found the sizing to be perfectly oversized for all shapes, sizes, and genders. This jacket feels like a plush fleece but is still thin enough for winter layering. It comes in several different color options, from navy to green or brown. This effortlessly cool mini skirt stands out for its functional cargo pockets and stretchy cotton moleskin fabric—and it looks equally great paired with a graphic tee or sweater as it does with a blouse and tights. These size-inclusive jeans are available in petite and tall lengths and have an extra two inches in the hips to create an easy-going, flattering fit. While some styles of Bonobos’ classic chinos aren’t on sale, these refined brushed twill chinos in a range of seasonal colors are up for grabs. They also come with Bonobos’ eye-catching lined pockets for a colorful touch of flair. Wear these medium-compression shorts under your ensemble for a smoothing effect. Designed with an ultra-thin, breathable fabric that is moisture-wicking and quick-drying and a no-squeeze silicone waistband that prevents rolling, this shapewear is as comfy as it is flattering. These best-selling booties have a chic baby heel and an elongated toe, with a padded interior for an easier break-in period. These sophisticated leather boots are well-suited for nearly any occasion, be it a trip to the office or a night out with friends. The 2.5-inch stacked heel adds a nice boost in height—that is, without needing to sacrifice on comfort. L.L.Bean's shearling-lined 10-inch boots are the warmest of the bunch, but any of the Bean Boots will serve you well through both fall and winter, and they go with most outfits. The boot that made L.L.Bean a household name. These boots are designed to keep feet dry, warm, and comfortable in rain, mud, and other wet conditions. As the second iteration of the Tree Dasher running sneaker, this version is even more comfortable and equipped for performance. Allbirds Women's Tree Runner sneakers are crazy comfortable with a flattering and close-fitting silhouette and have a smooth but texturized upper. It’s hard to think of a more legendary sneaker than Air Jordans. The Mid version, originally released in 2001, offers the classic look, cushioning, and stability of the OG High Top while being less restrictive and even more affordable (all colorways are on sale). They may be small, but these chunky double hoops add big style to any outfit. Choose from four color and metal combinations: double gold, double silver, gold/marble blue, gold/silver. With seven princess-cut diamonds set on a white gold band, this ring is perfect for a wedding band or special occasion.

This sleek leather wallet is ideal for those with dexterity issues as it can be opened with one hand, and it snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic seal. The 2022 MacBook Air introduced Apple's M2 processor, which improved performance over the M1 version. It has an especially thin and lightweight design, an improved webcam, and a larger display. Make sure to check for the 16GB RAM model, as it's becoming the standard base option instead of the original 8GB RAM model. The Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with a larger case and screen overall. It runs on the S10 processor; it has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. The second-generation Apple Watch SE is an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra, so it's still smooth despite being two years old. It doesn’t have the advanced health sensors of premium models, but it offers enough features to satisfy most people. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 for free as long as the line using the phone is on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and the user doesn't switch phones for 36 months. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 Pro Max without a trade-in for $5/month for 36 months (three years), which amounts to $180. The deal requires the Unlimited Ultimate plan for the line that's using the iPhone 16 Pro Max. If you switch phones before the 36 months period, you'll have to pay off the remaining balance of phone. New and existing Verizon customers can trade-in any phone in any condition from Apple, Google, or Samsung to get the iPhone 16 Pro free. You must keep the iPhone 16 Pro for 36 months (three years) to keep the deal active, and can't upgrade to a new phone. The line that's using this deal must have or upgrade to Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan. You also need service plans for the free iPad and Apple Watch. There may be a one-time $35 activation fee. It's possible to get an iPhone 16 Pro Max with this deal, but it would cost $5/month for 36 months. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung's top-end phone in 2024, set apart from its Galaxy S24 siblings and most of the premium phone competition with its four cameras, giant 6.8-inch display, stunning battery life, and included S Pen stylus. The Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a large 6.8-inch display and one of the best battery test results we've seen in a phone. The Pixel 9 Pro shares the same performance, first-rate three-lens camera system, super-bright Actua display, and Gemini AI suite with a free year of Gemini Advanced. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, but you'll be slowed to 4G LTE speeds after using 40GB. New customers can get half off their first three months when they pay up front. We recommend signing up for the Unlimited option to score the most savings since it's typically the priciest of the lineup. When you buy an eligible phone through Mint Mobile, you can bundle it with a year of an unlimited data plan at a 50% discounted rate of just $15/month. The MVNO is also heavily discounting several phones from their standard starting prices, including up to $500 off the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Dell's line of premium XPS laptops are known for their performance and reliability. The 9530 series features Intel's Core i7-13620H processor and starts with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. That should be plenty of performance and storage for most people with busy, fast-paced workloads. This Dell Inspiron's display folds 180-degrees to turn the laptop into a tablet. Running on the AMD Ryzen 5 8640HS processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, it can handle most people's workloads with ease. The base model IdeaPad 1 comes with a large 15-inch screen and runs on the entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor with 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage. It's purely for very basic uses, like lightweight web browsing, but it's priced well for its purpose. Creative Cloud allows you to enjoy all the best apps Adobe has to offer, including Photoshop, Animate, and Illustrator. Amazon's latest Kindle Paperwhite offers even faster performance than its predecessors in the same thin, waterproof form readers love. The latest version of the Echo Show 8 features improved audio, a built-in smart home hub, a better processor, and a revised design featuring edge-to-edge glass with a centered camera. Amazon’s fifth-generation Echo Dot offers improved sound quality over previous models, along with a temperature sensor and Eero WiFi extender capabilities. Samsung's Galaxy Watch 4 may be an older smartwatch, but it's still one of the best on the market, and now that it's available at a lower price, it's a great budget option for Android users. The latest Google Pixel Watch offers robust fitness tracking benefits like Fitbit Morning Brief, advanced running features, and target cardio load. With rapid two-sided printing (up to 35 pages per minute), a 250 sheet tray, and a built-in scanner/copier, HP's multi-function printer is a great choice for a home or small office setup. The touchscreen display makes navigating all the features super simple, too. ExpressVPN's two-year plan offers even more savings than its one-year counterpart, including six months free.

This new VPN deal drops the per-month price as low as $2.99 on a two-year plan.

In our tests, soft-side bags surprisingly tend to be more durable than hard-sided bags and offer a bit more flexibility in packing space. One of our editor's recently tested this human-sized dog bed, calling it a "dream come true" and "like laying in a supportive cloud." The Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow offers thoughtful features like adjustable fill, a washable pillow cover, and an unparalleled 100-night trial, making it the best choice for most people. Whether you want to knot it up for lounging on the couch, prop your feet on it, or snuggle up for a cozy night’s sleep, the Buffy Wiggle Pillow offers great full-body support.

Plus, they get softer with wear. Soft but not too thin, the Parachute Down-Alternative Pillow has the perfect loft for stomach sleepers who want just a bit of cushion. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons. The PS5 is one of the best gaming consoles you can buy thanks to its powerful hardware, unique controller, and exclusive games.

This model of MSI's Katans 15 gaming laptop features well-balanced specs for its 15-inch QHD 165Hz display. It'll run most demanding games well at high graphics settings.

The C255B-FWT240 model from Sceptre is a simple 1080p gaming monitor with an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate that's ideal for competitive gamers on a budget. It also features a 1ms response time, a 1500R curvature, AMD FreeSynce Premium, two DisplayPorts, and two HDMI ports. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. This Corsair drive is a great all-around PS5 SSD with a selection of sizes from 1GB up to 8TB. The built-in heatsink saves you a few dollars over buying one yourself and makes for a slightly easier installation process. 1TB/2TB is plenty for most gamers and is where the best value lies as the price jump on larger capcities is wildly disproportionate on a dollar per GB ratio. The J9+ is a powerful robot vacuum that deftly navigates around household obstacles, leaves hardwood floors spotless, and tackles low-pile carpets with ease. Although we haven't tried this exact model, we've tested a similar Shark 2-1 robot vacuum with Matrix technology and had great results. It has both standard suction and mopping abilities, hence the 2-1 in the name. We tested the Shark PowerDetect in a different color and found it was the best robot vacuum for pet hear, thanks to its roomy, self-empty charging dock and powerful suction when it detects heavy debris. The Ecovacs DEEBOT X2 OMNI Robot Vacuum & Mop is a wet-dry vacuum robot that maps your house quickly and has a station with a hands-off self-cleaning system. The V15 Detect Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum is one of Dyson's most powerful models. It features HEPA filtration and laser illumination to reveal hidden debris. This model usually runs north of $700, but it's 40% off right now. We've never seen it priced this low. The Dyson V11 Extra cordless vacuum cleaner is engineered with the power, versatility and run time for a whole-home deep clean. This cordless vacuum can help suck up pesky pet hair from anywhere in the house. At 4.5 quarts, this stand mixer is a bit smaller than we usually recommend for folks who want a full-size mixer, but this is a stellar deal if you don't mind the more petite capacity. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder grinds slowly, but that in turn reduces static, noise, and inconsistencies in your grounds. Make cooking easier with the Ninja Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) and its five different cooking settings. From baking to dehydrating, this air fryer can be the new secret touch behind your recipes.

Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This self-cleaning, programmable coffee maker allows you to choose your brew strength, so you always get the perfect cup of coffee. This white nonstick cookware set can help enhance any kitchen. It includes frying pans, a stock pot, saucepans with lids, and more. The classic 3D Whitestrips take only 20 days of use to complete a full treatment and also come with two sets of "1 Hour Express" strips for more last-minute whitening sessions. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Airwrap is a little too much blow-dryer-brush for most people, but there are few systems that give you such versatility. This multi-styler comes with six different options for brush heads, complete with a styling comb, filter cleaning brush, travel bag, and storage case. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world. A unique blend of Magnolia and musk with tangerine, the Fenty Eau de Parfum expresses itself uniquely on each wearer for a one-of-a-kind scent. Achieve the perfect lip combo with this three-piece gift set from Charlotte Tilbury. Customize with your favorite colors and finishes for a personal touch.

The Erno Laszlo Sea Mud Deep Cleansing Bar uses high-end ingredients to unclog pores. If you love eyeshadow palettes, this three-piece collector’s set is too good to miss. It’s an incredible value and includes three gorgeous color stories ideal for holiday parties and beyond. The most recently confirmed shade of Taylor Swift's iconic red lipstick, this warm brown-ish red was worn by Taylor to a 2024 Chiefs game. This cult-favorite concealer offers lightweight coverage that sinks seamlessly into the skin. This one-of-a-kind moisturizer is part skincare, part makeup. It's packed with nourishing oils like grapeseed. But instead of absorbing into your skin, the moisturizing ingredients sit on the surface and create a dewy glow that's also hydrating your skin. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. Apple's latest generation of AirPods features a new design to optimize comfort for wearers of every kind. It's powered by the H2 chip and uses a smaller case than ever. Apple's base AirPods are now available with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) without the use of in-ear tips. The new model uses the brand's H2 chip to power features like Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and Conversation Awareness. Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and noise canceling in a sleek, comfy design that’s tough to beat. Apple's update to the AirPods Max finally moves the headphones to USB-C charging and five new colors. Otherwise, the hardware and audio performance are largely the same. The Sonos Ace are the comfiest headphones we've reviewed. They also offer great noise-canceling and audio quality that rival top models from the competition. Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30 headphones offer noise-canceling performance that’s much better than it should be for the money, alongside solid sound quality and massive battery life. Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra once more put the brand on top, with best-in-class noise canceling wrapped in a sleek and comfy design. The Beats Studio Pro x Kim Kardashian are the same as the standard Studio Pro wireless headphones, but with a color curated by Kim Kardashian. They are designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable. Learn more about which Quince's styles we've tried in our full Quince review. Gabrielle Chase. I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily A spike in online shopping and sufficient turnouts in the malls, outlets and urban shopping districts over Black Friday weekend portend a healthy stretch ahead in the days leading to Christmas. So far, so good. After weeks of early discounting culminating on Black Friday, U.S. retailers saw enough gift shopping over the weekend to buoy hopes of meeting or beating their holiday sales goals. While traffic in stores on Black Friday and Saturday was slightly down to flat from a year ago, online traffic was robust. As consumers got into the holiday spending spirit, demand overcame inflation and cost of living concerns, at least temporarily. Purchasing on Friday and Saturday was also driven by the strong stock market, where on Friday the Dow closed at a record 44,910.65 points; less uncertainty due to the presidential election being decided, and weather conditions conducive to hitting the malls. Temperature drops on Friday and Saturday spurred sales of outerwear and winter accessories, which lagged through the fall; activewear also fared well. Retailers are generally managing inventories better, and utilizing AI more to gauge demand and generate flash sales.

Globally, Cyber Monday is seen driving $51 billion in online sales, up from $48.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, Salesforce said. The software giant also reported that during the first half of Cyber Week, retailers using GenAI in their service experience saw a 9 percent higher conversion rate compared to retailers who are not. Another software giant, Adobe, reported that on Black Friday U.S. consumers spent a $10.8 billion online, up 10.2 percent year-over-year. Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., $11.3 million was spent online every minute on Black Friday, with toys, jewelry, appliances, personal care, apparel and electronics among the top-performing categories, Adobe reported. “Crossing the $10 billion mark is a big e-commerce milestone for Black Friday, for a day that in the past was more anchored toward in-store shopping,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “And with consumers getting more comfortable with everything from mobile shopping to chatbots, we have tailwinds that can prop up online growth moving forward.” Mastercard reported that U.S. store and online sales on Black Friday, excluding automotive sales and unadjusted for inflation, were up 3.4 percent. “Black Friday was a good indicator of how the holiday season is positively shaping up,” said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “Our real-time insights show that consumers are comfortably in the gift-giving spirit as price reductions and deals occur across sectors, supporting budgets for holiday shopping.” Mastercard indicated that online retail sales on Black Friday increased 14.6 percent, while in-store sales were up just 0.7 percent, compared to Black Friday last year. Jewelry, electronics and apparel were cited as the top categories, with particular strength in apparel e-commerce. “Shoppers are making the most of seasonal deals and enjoying a balance of experiences spending and gifts for all loved ones,” said Steve Sadove, senior adviser for Mastercard and former chairman and chief executive officer of Saks Inc. “They’re more strategic in their shopping, though, prioritizing promotions that they believe hold the greatest value — opening their wallets, but with more intentional distribution.” “Black Friday is no longer a day. It’s a season,” said Stephen Yalof, president and CEO of Tanger, the Greensboro, N.C.-based operator of 39 outlet centers and one lifestyle center. “The traffic starts building in late October/early November, and Tanger has been promoting Black Friday every day in November with different brands and sales to keep things exciting. Our traffic numbers this weekend beat last year. People are shopping in large groups. The whole family is coming out and shoppers are looking for deals.” Coach, Ralph Lauren, Columbia, American Eagle, Aerie, Viori, Nike, Adidas and Gap Inc. were among the busiest outlets in Tanger centers over the weekend, Yalof said. Asked if the deals were bigger this year than last year, Yalof replied, “I think so. The discounting started earlier this year than last year and a lot of the brands in some instances have better deals than last year, and on selected items. Yeti was on sale. I’ve never seen Yeti on sale.” The consumer mindset, he said, is to “shop now and come in early” for fear that a particular product would sell out. “There’s a frenzied-ness I haven’t seen in recent years. I think it’s fueled by the shorter selling season and the weather just turning cold.” Data from major software firms indicated that traffic at stores are down slightly from last year, but Yalof said, “Outlets are a different story. I visited a couple of full-price centers also and there were plenty of cars there, but the aspirational outlet shopper is looking for deals and they are lining up in our centers.” “Everything we got from our malls is really positive,” said Stephen Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL & Associates Properties, the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based real estate investment trust, when asked to comment on Friday’s and Saturday’s business. “We had really good crowds early. The stores offering good promotions had lines. The parking lots were full by mid-morning and stayed busy all day Friday.” Lebovitz said the Wednesday before Thanksgiving saw a stronger turnout than the same day a year ago. “People were hitting it hard given the short holiday season.” Each year there’s typically a lull in business after Cyber Monday until 10 days to two weeks before Christmas. “Because of the shorter calendar, we don’t think there will be as much of a lull this year,” Lebovitz said. Stores selling activewear, casual apparel and cosmetics, and those offering promotions and good discounts fared the best, Lebovitz said, noting that consumers have been hit by “a barrage of emails and texts” from retailers. CBL has a total of 94 malls, and outlet, lifestyle and open-air centers, primarily in the Southeast and Midwest. “Things were good, not great,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. He said the weekend marked a return to shopping “normalcy” in the aftermath of COVID-19 and the subsequent spending splurge from federal assistance putting money into consumers’ pockets. Americans, Johnson said, are “shopping with a balance of wants and needs.” Johnson said transaction velocity was highest at Costco, Walmart, Amazon, Gap Inc. and Urban Outfitters. Category-wise, athleisure was a standout, with Lululemon, Viori, Alo and Free People performing well in the category, Johnson said. He also said that the promotional pace has been quite similar to last year, with discounts typically offering 30 percent off, with some up to 40 percent and select goods at the 50 percent mark. Almost all the retail promotions so far have been pre-planned. “There has not been any fire-sale pricing,” Johnson said. At Elyse Walker, which operates six Elyse Walker designer stores and two Towne specialty stores, “Black Friday was a very healthy kick-off to holiday shopping,” said Summer Holl, president. “While we ran a Black Friday weekend promo that drove motivated traffic — additional 20 percent off markdown in store and online — we had a great mix of full-price selling and appointments as well. Our Los Angeles flagship was up triple digits to Black Friday last year and we saw a 10 percent comp increase in our New York City flagship. Footwear, both sale and full price, was a top seller. Shoppers were looking for buy now, wear now deals, knits and outerwear. Full-price selling was driven by new designer deliveries from Celine, Loewe, Bottega Veneta, Khaite and Altuzarra.” “I’m beyond happy,” said Chris Riccobono, founder of Untuckit, which operates 89 stores across the U.S. as well as a robust online business. “It was amazing.” He said the company launched its planned promotional sale a week early this year and was worried that the aggressive stance of some competitors might take a bite out of Untuckit’s business. That turned out not to be the case. “We held the same discount as we have for the past 13 years,” Riccobono said, with select items being offered at 50 and 60 percent off regular retail. “We comped up pretty significantly both in our stores and online. They’re not always in sync, but in this case, it was pretty even . . . . Everything was great last week — maybe [consumers] were just waiting for the election to end.” Bestsellers included the men’s wrinkle-free Veneto shirt program, Hemsworth flannel shirt, wrinkle-free Cadetto shirt, the Lawrence and Cord shirts, the Archer sweater flannel and the Traveler pant program. While Untuckit is primarily a men’s brand, the women’s Bella program and the Lexie Sequin shirtdress were top performers. Commenting on the business ahead, Riccobono said, “It’s held for eight days in a row so we feel like it’ll be a great holiday season.” “Our full-price retail was strong the last month and we experienced the same trend during Black Friday,” said Ken Ohashi, CEO of Brooks Brothers. The company’s stores and e-commerce performed similarly well. “They were neck and neck,” he said, “And we have significantly less clearance than last year. We’re pretty clean and our gross margin and maintained margin are up, so we’re feeling good.” As a result, the company moved some dollars previously spent on affiliate marketing to more traditional advertising such as billboards, television and out-of-home ads. “It’s helping us,” he said. Among the top sellers were “holiday dressing” pieces and formalwear, which were the focus in this year’s holiday campaign. Elevated sportswear in sweaters and knits also did well. Despite the compressed calendar, Ohashi expects the strong performance to continue through December. “The stores that we recently expanded or are in new markets all performed very well,” he said, pointing to the larger Rockefeller Center store in New York City, as well as the Wisconsin Avenue unit in Washington, D.C., and Newbury Street in Boston. “They all performed well,” he said. “Newbury Street, in particular, has been on fire and four out of five people there have never shopped with us before.” As a result, Ohashi said he’s “not stressed going into the first quarter in terms of inventory,” and believes 2025 will also be strong for Brooks Brothers. Rhone had a strong holiday kickoff, too. “We had record-setting days in all channels,” said CEO Nate Checketts, who hit stores this weekend in Boston while his cofounder and brother Ben hit stores in Los Angeles. He said that in addition to strength in a new menswear product called the Coldspell Commuter Pant, which features a brushed flannel lining for warmth, Rhone was pleased with the performance of its recently launched women’s collection. “We saw higher ‘mixed baskets,’ of people buying both men’s and women’s,” Checketts said. Rhone stuck to its planned promotions of 30 percent off on orders of $300 or more. “We’ve run the same promotions for the last four years and we did the same this year,” he said. “Consumers are starting to come back in a stronger way after a year of uncertainty and a post-election cycle. It’s been a crazy couple of years.” But with the strength of Black Friday weekend as a backdrop he’s hopeful the momentum will be “pulled forward” to Cyber Monday and the remainder of the season. Bob Mitchell, co-CEO of Mitchells Stores, which operates luxury units under the Mitchells, Richards, Wilkes Bashford and Marios names on the East and West Coasts, said that despite Thanksgiving being a week later than last year, business in 2024 is very strong. “We just capped off a record, double-digit November and we’re off to a double-digit start for the holiday season,” he said. “Men’s has come on strong in the last few weeks,” particularly tailored clothing — especially sport coats — and sportswear. New spring deliveries have also started to check, he said. In women’s, “while ready-to-wear is up, we’re also seeing nice growth in handbags and jewelry, which has been the star.” Top luxury performers at Mitchells Stores were Brunello Cucinelli, Zegna, Loro Piana, Brioni, Canali, Akris and The Row while Fedeli and Baldessari did well in the mid-tier. Although reluctant to characterize the season as a success this early, Mitchell is upbeat. “The real numbers don’t start for us until 10 days before, so this could all be a mirage,” he said with a laugh. “But the customer is in a very good mood with how the [stock] market is performing and Bitcoin. So we expect it will be a good season.” Shopify merchants saw $5 billion in Black Friday sales this year, up 22 percent from $4.1 billion a year ago. Sales peaked at $4.6 million per minute at 12:01 p.m. EST on Friday and the average cart carried $111.12 worth of goods, driven by sales of tops, cosmetics, fitness and nutrition, pants and activewear. Los Angeles, New York, London, San Francisco and Miami were among the platform’s top cities for the day. As of Sunday morning — and headed toward Cyber Monday — Shopify was seeing about 12,500 orders and sales of more than $1.2 million per minute. Shopify powers more than 2 million online merchants. Target stores opened at 6 a.m. on Black Friday, but shoppers in some places started lining up as early as 11:30 the night before. The big-box store sought to draw consumers with Taylor Swift exclusives, including “The Official Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,” as well as versions of her album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” on CD and vinyl. As some locations sold out of at least part of their Taylor Swift goodies by 10 a.m., Target looked to steer the traffic to other parts of the store with discounts, including 40 percent off for fleece and 50 percent off for some women’s, kids and men’s looks. At Talbots, tops and sweaters were big sellers, due partially to a Black Friday special of $29.50 ”FestiviTees” for holiday-themed knit tops that generated 22,000 units in sales, according to a spokesperson. For gifting, sleepwear especially plaid flannel pajamas, were top sellers, along with down puffers and fashion vests. At Loft, consumers were favoring cozy styles including novelty and shimmery designs. Everyday crewneck sweaters, soft sweat sets, puffer coats, vests, and Lou & Grey loungewear were among the best sellers. While most retailers were closed Thanksgiving, Loft’s Times Square location was open and had customers waiting on line before the opening. Soma’s strong performers were “Cool Nights PJ sets,” loungewear, and bras, as well as a Soma printed tote bag gift with $100 purchase in stores only. Customers were “definitely ready” to shop for gifts and for themselves, according to the spokesperson. Shoppers at White House Black Market favored denim, sequins, faux fur, leather and novelty pants for work and holiday parties. Bustiers, embellished sweaters and party dresses were popular in red, purple, and black and white. Dick’s Sporting Goods flagged a handful of bestsellers, for example, in men’s, Nike’s full-zip Windrunner hoodie, On Cloud 5 shoes, and Carhartt’s K288 hoodie. In women’s, Nike’s Phoenix fleece oversize sweatshirt, Hoka’s women’s Clifton 9 running shoes and Calia soft scuba joggers, were cited. The weekend saw up to 30 percent off select Nike apparel, such as with Nike club hoodies, sweatshirts and joggers. Weather through the U.S. this past weekend was the coldest in more than 25 years, according to Evan Gold, executive vice president of Planalytics. And Black Friday was the coldest on a national basis since 2007, Gold added. Over the weekend, “New York City and a lot of other major markets in the Northeast were below freezing for the first time this season,” pushing demand for outerwear, sweaters, hats and gloves up 5 to 15 percent,” Gold said. New York City’s average temperature was 40 degrees versus 44 last year. Chicago averaged 23 degrees versus 33 last year, and Minneapolis was 16 degrees versus 27 degrees. Even Atlanta was colder, averaging 45 degrees versus 51 degrees last year. A few cities in the South Central and West were slightly warmer this weekend, with Los Angeles and Phoenix both averaging 65 degrees versus 62 last year. “It’s definitely going to be a colder December,” Gold said. “Last December was the warmest ever recorded.” New York City is expected to average 30 degrees, or 10 degrees colder than a year ago; Chicago will average in the low- to mid-20s, or about 18 degrees colder than last year. Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, said retailers started to “bluntly” lay out Black Friday deals in early November, when warmer weather was restraining sales of outerwear. Because the season started early — as has been the case for a number of years — she said price discounts ticked up only slightly on Black Friday. And all the holiday price promotions mean a little less given the impact of inflation across the economy. “That’s just going to make the consumers feel more selective,” Ramírez said. “I don’t think this is going to be a great holiday season in general for retail. I think it’s still going to be flat [when] you adjust inflation into it.” It’s a pricing dynamic that plays to the strengths of Walmart and the off-price channel, which Ramírez said would be winners. But value isn’t just about price. She said Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Hoka and On — brands that have been on the rise and are playing to a strong area of the market — are well positioned and are going into the holiday season with only minimal promotions. “The retail sector is being run much better than it has been in many years, in terms of inventory, in terms of price, in terms of promotions and even leaning into categories that make sense for the consumer today,” Ramírez said. In a good sign for fashion, “There is still that shift of people going more into office,” Ramírez said. “So apparel might have a better season.” According to a report on Black Friday from consulting firm Ankura, “Stores like Lululemon, Nike, Gap and Athleta were extremely busy; Columbia, North Face and Converse were also busy with deeper discounts.” Ankura also reported that Coach, Ugg and Michael Kors performed well, benefiting from discounts and consumer interest in luxury deals. Regarding department stores, Ankura reported, “While some anchor stores like Macy’s successfully attracted shoppers with organized and well-staffed environments, others such as Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom struggled with lower traffic and less effective promotional strategies. In general, those with clear and substantial discounts seemed to fare better.” Meanwhile, “Beauty stores ran aggressive promotions and had the traffic to prove it. Where they appeared to fail, was in the ability to restock the shelves during the day. By mid-day Sephora and Ulta Beauty shelves were stripped clean and have to imagine missed a lot of sales.” — With contributions from Lisa Lockwood, Evan Clark and Rosemary Feitelberg Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

We’re pretty clean and our gross margin and maintained margin are up, so we’re feeling good.” As a result, the company moved some dollars previously spent on affiliate marketing to more traditional advertising such as billboards, television and out-of-home ads. “It’s helping us,” he said. Among the top sellers were “holiday dressing” pieces and formalwear, which were the focus in this year’s holiday campaign. Elevated sportswear in sweaters and knits also did well. Despite the compressed calendar, Ohashi expects the strong performance to continue through December. “The stores that we recently expanded or are in new markets all performed very well,” he said, pointing to the larger Rockefeller Center store in New York City, as well as the Wisconsin Avenue unit in Washington, D.C., and Newbury Street in Boston. “They all performed well,” he said. “Newbury Street, in particular, has been on fire and four out of five people there have never shopped with us before.” As a result, Ohashi said he’s “not stressed going into the first quarter in terms of inventory,” and believes 2025 will also be strong for Brooks Brothers. Rhone had a strong holiday kickoff, too. “We had record-setting days in all channels,” said CEO Nate Checketts, who hit stores this weekend in Boston while his cofounder and brother Ben hit stores in Los Angeles. He said that in addition to strength in a new menswear product called the Coldspell Commuter Pant, which features a brushed flannel lining for warmth, Rhone was pleased with the performance of its recently launched women’s collection. “We saw higher ‘mixed baskets,’ of people buying both men’s and women’s,” Checketts said. Rhone stuck to its planned promotions of 30 percent off on orders of $300 or more. “We’ve run the same promotions for the last four years and we did the same this year,” he said. “Consumers are starting to come back in a stronger way after a year of uncertainty and a post-election cycle. It’s been a crazy couple of years.” But with the strength of Black Friday weekend as a backdrop he’s hopeful the momentum will be “pulled forward” to Cyber Monday and the remainder of the season. Bob Mitchell, co-CEO of Mitchells Stores, which operates luxury units under the Mitchells, Richards, Wilkes Bashford and Marios names on the East and West Coasts, said that despite Thanksgiving being a week later than last year, business in 2024 is very strong. “We just capped off a record, double-digit November and we’re off to a double-digit start for the holiday season,” he said. “Men’s has come on strong in the last few weeks,” particularly tailored clothing — especially sport coats — and sportswear. New spring deliveries have also started to check, he said. In women’s, “while ready-to-wear is up, we’re also seeing nice growth in handbags and jewelry, which has been the star.” Top luxury performers at Mitchells Stores were Brunello Cucinelli, Zegna, Loro Piana, Brioni, Canali, Akris and The Row while Fedeli and Baldessari did well in the mid-tier. Although reluctant to characterize the season as a success this early, Mitchell is upbeat. “The real numbers don’t start for us until 10 days before, so this could all be a mirage,” he said with a laugh. “But the customer is in a very good mood with how the [stock] market is performing and Bitcoin. So we expect it will be a good season.” Shopify merchants saw $5 billion in Black Friday sales this year, up 22 percent from $4.1 billion a year ago. Sales peaked at $4.6 million per minute at 12:01 p.m. EST on Friday and the average cart carried $111.12 worth of goods, driven by sales of tops, cosmetics, fitness and nutrition, pants and activewear. Los Angeles, New York, London, San Francisco and Miami were among the platform’s top cities for the day. As of Sunday morning — and headed toward Cyber Monday — Shopify was seeing about 12,500 orders and sales of more than $1.2 million per minute. Shopify powers more than 2 million online merchants. Target stores opened at 6 a.m. on Black Friday, but shoppers in some places started lining up as early as 11:30 the night before. The big-box store sought to draw consumers with Taylor Swift exclusives, including “The Official Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,” as well as versions of her album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” on CD and vinyl. As some locations sold out of at least part of their Taylor Swift goodies by 10 a.m., Target looked to steer the traffic to other parts of the store with discounts, including 40 percent off for fleece and 50 percent off for some women’s, kids and men’s looks. At Talbots, tops and sweaters were big sellers, due partially to a Black Friday special of $29.50 ”FestiviTees” for holiday-themed knit tops that generated 22,000 units in sales, according to a spokesperson. For gifting, sleepwear especially plaid flannel pajamas, were top sellers, along with down puffers and fashion vests. At Loft, consumers were favoring cozy styles including novelty and shimmery designs. Everyday crewneck sweaters, soft sweat sets, puffer coats, vests, and Lou & Grey loungewear were among the best sellers. While most retailers were closed Thanksgiving, Loft’s Times Square location was open and had customers waiting on line before the opening. Soma’s strong performers were “Cool Nights PJ sets,” loungewear, and bras, as well as a Soma printed tote bag gift with $100 purchase in stores only. Customers were “definitely ready” to shop for gifts and for themselves, according to the spokesperson. Shoppers at White House Black Market favored denim, sequins, faux fur, leather and novelty pants for work and holiday parties. Bustiers, embellished sweaters and party dresses were popular in red, purple, and black and white. Dick’s Sporting Goods flagged a handful of bestsellers, for example, in men’s, Nike’s full-zip Windrunner hoodie, On Cloud 5 shoes, and Carhartt’s K288 hoodie. In women’s, Nike’s Phoenix fleece oversize sweatshirt, Hoka’s women’s Clifton 9 running shoes and Calia soft scuba joggers, were cited. The weekend saw up to 30 percent off select Nike apparel, such as with Nike club hoodies, sweatshirts and joggers. Weather through the U.S. this past weekend was the coldest in more than 25 years, according to Evan Gold, executive vice president of Planalytics. And Black Friday was the coldest on a national basis since 2007, Gold added. Over the weekend, “New York City and a lot of other major markets in the Northeast were below freezing for the first time this season,” pushing demand for outerwear, sweaters, hats and gloves up 5 to 15 percent,” Gold said. New York City’s average temperature was 40 degrees versus 44 last year. Chicago averaged 23 degrees versus 33 last year, and Minneapolis was 16 degrees versus 27 degrees. Even Atlanta was colder, averaging 45 degrees versus 51 degrees last year. A few cities in the South Central and West were slightly warmer this weekend, with Los Angeles and Phoenix both averaging 65 degrees versus 62 last year. “It’s definitely going to be a colder December,” Gold said. “Last December was the warmest ever recorded.” New York City is expected to average 30 degrees, or 10 degrees colder than a year ago; Chicago will average in the low- to mid-20s, or about 18 degrees colder than last year. Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, said retailers started to “bluntly” lay out Black Friday deals in early November, when warmer weather was restraining sales of outerwear. Because the season started early — as has been the case for a number of years — she said price discounts ticked up only slightly on Black Friday. And all the holiday price promotions mean a little less given the impact of inflation across the economy. “That’s just going to make the consumers feel more selective,” Ramírez said. “I don’t think this is going to be a great holiday season in general for retail. I think it’s still going to be flat [when] you adjust inflation into it.” It’s a pricing dynamic that plays to the strengths of Walmart and the off-price channel, which Ramírez said would be winners. But value isn’t just about price. She said Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Hoka and On — brands that have been on the rise and are playing to a strong area of the market — are well positioned and are going into the holiday season with only minimal promotions. “The retail sector is being run much better than it has been in many years, in terms of inventory, in terms of price, in terms of promotions and even leaning into categories that make sense for the consumer today,” Ramírez said. In a good sign for fashion, “There is still that shift of people going more into office,” Ramírez said. “So apparel might have a better season.” According to a report on Black Friday from consulting firm Ankura, “Stores like Lululemon, Nike, Gap and Athleta were extremely busy; Columbia, North Face and Converse were also busy with deeper discounts.” Ankura also reported that Coach, Ugg and Michael Kors performed well, benefiting from discounts and consumer interest in luxury deals. Regarding department stores, Ankura reported, “While some anchor stores like Macy’s successfully attracted shoppers with organized and well-staffed environments, others such as Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom struggled with lower traffic and less effective promotional strategies. In general, those with clear and substantial discounts seemed to fare better.” Meanwhile, “Beauty stores ran aggressive promotions and had the traffic to prove it. Where they appeared to fail, was in the ability to restock the shelves during the day. By mid-day Sephora and Ulta Beauty shelves were stripped clean and have to imagine missed a lot of sales.” — With contributions from Lisa Lockwood, Evan Clark and Rosemary Feitelberg Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Smart home9. Streaming10. Gaming11. Smartwatches12. Live updates Are you scrambling to find last-minute deals because you realized Cyber Monday is almost over? Fear, not. As a procrastinator myself and a seasoned deals editor, I've gone through today's sales from Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart and hand-picked the best Cyber Monday deals that are still available and worth your money.The good news is that some excellent offers are still available, with record-low prices on TVs, kitchen gadgets, Apple Watches, robot vacuums, and smart home devices from brands like Sony, Samsung, Bissell, and Ninja. I've been combing through offers for weeks, and I'm only listing highly-rated products at lowest-ever prices, with detailed information about each item.Below is a list of today's best Cyber Monday sales, followed by the top deals on TVs, Apple devices, appliances, smart home gadgets, headphones, and gaming consoles. I also have today's best Cyber Monday streaming deals, which include an impressive offer from Hulu for just 99¢ a month for a year. Other highlights I'm surprised are still available include LG's 48-inch B4 OLED for $599.99 and this Chefman air fryer on sale for only $59.Remember that most Cyber Monday sales, including those at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, end tonight, and this might be your last opportunity of the year to find an item discounted at this price. The best-selling Apple AirTag rarely gets discounted, but Amazon has the four-pack for just $69.99 - a new record-low price. If you tend to misplace your keys or wallet, just attach the Apple AirTag to anything you don't want to want to lose, and your iPhone will locate it. Disney Plus and Hulu annual ad-supported plan: was $10.99 per month now $2.99 at Hulu and Disney PlusBoth Disney Plus and Hulu's ad-supported plans are normally just under $11 dollars a month for a bundle, but you can now get them both for $2.99 a month, representing a saving of more than 72% on annual plan. Sadly, you'll have to watch commercials on both streaming services, but with a saving of over $200 on offer compared to if you bought both services separately, we suspect you'll think it's a price worth paying. Offer ends on December 2. Amazon's brand new Echo Spot pairs a 2.83-inch touch with a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker, which might make it the ideal smart alarm clock. With Alexa onboard, you can ask the assistant for the weather, play music, or even schedule alarms. Today's Cyber Monday deal is a return to the record-low price. Are you looking for a cheap air fryer deal this Cyber Monday? Walmart is offering a massive 50% discount on the top-rated Chefman air fryer, bringing the price down to $50. The eight-quart air fryer features a basket divider, so you can separate food for dual cooking. If you want to add a budget big-screen 4K TV to your home, you won't find a better deal this Cyber Monday. The 2024 Insignia 75-inch TV features 4K HD resolution, smart capabilities with the Fire operating system, and a voice remote with hands-free Alexa, so you can use your voice to control your TV. Today's Cyber Monday deal on the budget Apple Watch SE for $149 is a new record-low price. The Apple Watch SE tracks activity, sleep, and calories burned and will notify you when a high or low heart rate is detected. The water-resistant smartwatch also helps you stay connected by allowing you to receive notifications, take calls, and reply to texts directly from your wrist. The LG B4 is one of the most affordable OLED TVs on the market, and Best Buy has the 48-inch model on sale for $599.99 - an incredible price. Its self-lit OLED pixels and Dolby Vision together enhance color and contrast beyond what the average backlit TV can do. Its built-in gaming features and 120Hz refresh rate make it an unbeatable deal for gamers looking for an upgrade. The Floor One S5 is a wet-and-dry floor cleaner with sensors that enable it to boost power when it detects a particularly dirty area. It's great at tackling stains and spillages of all kinds and boasts a self-clean function to minimize maintenance effort. With over $200 off the list price, it's excellent value for money with this record-low Cyber Monday deal. With a 15.6-inch 1080p screen, the Echo Show 15 enlarges the classic Alexa smart display experience. With the included wall mount, you can easily place it and use it as a smart family hub. Via built-in widgets and apps, you can check the weather, ask topical questions, play your favorite videos on YouTube or Prime Video, and view your favorite photos. Amazon's brand new Echo Spot pairs a 2.83-inch touch with a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker, which might make it the ideal smart alarm clock. With Alexa onboard, you can ask the assistant for the weather, play music, or even schedule alarms. Today's Cyber Monday deal is a return to the record-low price. This Black+Decker Dustbuster has over 100,000 positive reviews on Amazon, and thanks to today's Cyber Monday sale, it's on sale for just $39.99 – the lowest price we've seen all year and just $2 shy of the record low. The handheld vacuum is lightweight, portable, easy to recharge, and has a crevice tool to clean hard-to-reach areas. It's an Amazon best-seller rarely on sale, so you should snap up today's discount. Record-low price: This is $12 cheaper than AirPods Pro 2 have ever been, and I expect this deal won't last long. They sound excellent, the noise cancellation is top tier, Dolby Atmos spatial audio is amazing for movies, and they even have an unlosable case, thanks to tech that points you to where it's hiding (and a speaker to help, too). They're also very small and light, which is great for comfort. The previous lowest price was $169, so absolutely do not miss this deal – they're fantastic value for this price. Here it is, folks - the best deal yet on the latest Dell XPS 13. Complete with a brand-new Snapdragon X Elite chipset, this model is capable of not just exceptional day-to-day performance, but also battery life that's simply a cut-above what Windows laptops usually offer. Alongside superb specs, the latest XPS 13 also features a gorgeous lightweight design and a display that's perfect for both work and casual everyday use. This is an incredible price for a pair of wireless on-ear headphones – on sale for just $24.95 at Amazon right now. The JBL Tune 510BT features Wireless Bluetooth 5.0 Streaming, so you can stream music and podcasts and take calls from your device, and you'll enjoy an impressive 40 hours of battery life. It's no t a model we've tested, but the JBL Tune 510BT have over 50,000 positive reviews on Amazon and are one of the best-selling headphones on the site. They also come with JBL's renowned Pure Bass sound. If you need something inexpensive and you need it now, it's hard to argue with this price tag… ^ Back to all deals The best-selling Apple AirTag rarely gets discounted, but Amazon has the four-pack for just $69.99 - a new record-low price. If you tend to misplace your keys or wallet, just attach the Apple AirTag to anything you don't want to want to lose, and your iPhone will locate it. Record-low price: This is $12 cheaper than AirPods Pro 2 have ever been, and I expect this deal won't last long.

They're also very small and light, which is great for comfort. The previous lowest price was $169, so absolutely do not miss this deal – they're fantastic value for this price. Getting $150 off a tablet that could double as a laptop is not bad at all. This iPad Pro features a high-resolution Liquid Retina XDR display, strong battery life, and 256GB of storage. These specs are impressive already but when paired with the latest M4 chip you get a tablet that is truly special indeed. The power makes it possible to effortlessly perform even the most demanding of tasks, including photo and video editing as well as gaming. Apple's best-selling 10.2 iPad with 64GB of storage just dropped to $199 - a new record-low price. While the tablet is an older model, it still packs a 10.2-inch Retina display, and the A13 Bionic chip ensures excellent picture quality and superior performance. According to our Apple iPad 10.2 review, the entry-level tablet can do it all without issue, whether browsing the net, streaming media, doing light work, or playing games. At just $599 - Walmart is practically giving away Apple's MacBook Air. Not only is this an outstanding price for such a powerful laptop that still holds up great for 2024, but this could be the last chance to pick one up now that it's officially discontinued. Don't miss this incredible deal if you're looking for a great bang for the buck MacBook. Best Buy has a great Cyber Monday deal on the excellent MacBook Air M2. Even though a newer M3 version is available, we concluded that this is still one of the best laptops you can buy in our MacBook Air M2 review, thanks to the stylish design, clear display, impressive performance, and long 18-hour battery life. For those needing a premium powerhouse for creative apps such as photo editing, video editing and more intense workloads, this is a near-unbeatable offer on an Apple machine right now - and one I don't see going any lower thanks to the Best Buy Holiday price guarantee. Display - 14 inchesProcessor - Apple M4RAM - 16GBStorage - 512GBOS - macOS Want to get your hands on the latest Apple hardware? We don't blame you, considering how efficient the M4 architecture is. Our MacBook Pro M4 review labeled it "one of the best Pro laptops" for a reason: it's extremely performant, got a base RAM bump from 8GB to 16GB, has that gorgeous inimitable Apple look to it, and have you seen that display? Absolutely stunning. Today's Cyber Monday deal on the budget Apple Watch SE for $149 is a new record-low price. The Apple Watch SE tracks activity, sleep, and calories burned and will notify you when a high or low heart rate is detected. The water-resistant smartwatch also helps you stay connected by allowing you to receive notifications, take calls, and reply to texts directly from your wrist. This might be Amazon's best Cyber Monday deal - Apple's all-new Apple Watch 10 on sale for a new record-low price of $329. The Apple Watch 10 includes upgrades such as Apple's new S10 chipset, sleep apnea detection, depth gauge, and a new design featuring the most advanced display. I don't expect you'll find a better price this year, and this offer is in danger of being sold out. ^ Back to all deals Get the best compact, single-serve blender for under $50 at Walmart's sale ahead of Cyber Monday. This is an ideal solution for your daily smoothie or protein shake. With its built-in handle and sippy cup lid, you'll be ready to make your favorite creation just before leaving the house. Thanks to its compact size, this Keurig K-Mini coffee maker is a great choice for those working with a small kitchen space. It can brew a cup in just minutes and is less than five inches wide. Today's deal ahead of Cyber Monday from Amazon brings the price down to just $49, a new record-low price. The Nespresso Vertuo Pop Plus Deluxe by Breville is on sale for its cheapest price yet. This easy-to-use coffee maker supports multiple types of drinks and sizes, and you can brew these using dedicated recyclable Nespresso pods. The large removable water tank and compact size also add to its convenience. Make a cup of coffee in less than two minutes with Keurig's best-selling K-Elite, which is on sale for $109.99 – the lowest price we've seen this year. Five brew-size selections let you choose how much to make, while Strong brew and Iced options mean you can enjoy a bold morning cup or a refreshing afternoon beverage with the touch of a button. The Ninja Creami ice cream maker will surely be a Cyber Monday best-seller due to its popularity at recent holiday sales, and Walmart has the appliance down to a record-low price. You can make ice cream, milkshakes, and sorbets with a touch of a button and add your favorite mix-ins and flavors. Are you looking for a cheap air fryer deal this Cyber Monday? Walmart is offering a massive 50% discount on the top-rated Chefman air fryer, bringing the price down to $50. The eight-quart air fryer features a basket divider, so you can separate food for dual cooking. Ninja is one of the most popular air fryer manufacturers, and this is a new record-low price for one of its latest and easiest-to-use appliances. The 5-quart capacity drawer is enough to make meals for the whole family, and preset functions allow for easy air frying, roasting, reheating, and dehydrating. The compact design means it'll comfortably fit on your countertop, too. Amazon has just discounted this one even further for Cyber Monday thanks to an easy-to-miss $12 coupon code. This is the cheapest this multi-functional air fryer has been since Cyber Monday last year, with 40% off the list price at Amazon. We're particularly big fans of Vortex's Odor Erase technology (also used by the excellent Instant Vortex Plus 6-in-1), which does an excellent job at eliminating cooking smells. KitchenAid is a mainstay in the Bake Off tent and still the leader when it comes to high-quality stand mixers – but they do come with a hefty upfront cost. This healthy $120 discount on the premium Artisan model definitely takes the sting out, though. It comes with a stainless steel bowl and three attachments for mixing, kneading, and beating – everything the amateur or intermediate baker needs for the kitchen. ^ Back to all deals The LG B4 is one of the most affordable OLED TVs on the market, and Best Buy has the 48-inch model on sale for $599.99 - an incredible price. Its self-lit OLED pixels and Dolby Vision together enhance color and contrast beyond what the average backlit TV can do. Its built-in gaming features and 120Hz refresh rate make it an unbeatable deal for gamers looking for an upgrade. Samsung's The Frame TV is my dream Cyber Monday purchase, and the 55-inch model just dropped to a jaw-dropping price of $849.99. The 2024 Samsung Frame TV features Pantone art-validated colors that deliver lifelike images. Plus, the display now comes with Streams, a complimentary set of artwork streamed from the Samsung Art Store. This is a new record-low price that won't budge over Cyber Monday I'd say. Amazon's best-selling 43-inch 4-Series 4K smart TV is on sale for $229.99 - a new record-low price. It offers 4K HD resolution, smart capabilities with the Fire operating system, and a voice remote with hands-free Alexa, so you can use your voice to control your TV. Our Samsung S95D review awarded this OLED display five stars and said it was 'the very pinnacle of OLED TV'. The Samsung TV delivers stunning picture quality, top-notch gaming performance, and a beautiful design, combining to offer one of the best OLED TVs money can buy right now. Today's early Cyber Monday deal from Samsung brings the price of the 65-inch model down to $2,299.99, which is a $1,100 discount and a record-low price. Samsung’s top mini-LED TV for 2024 now starts at a record-low of just $899 today at Samsung. That’s an excellent deal for an upper mid-range TV offering the high brightness, anti-glare screen, and wide viewing angle needed for daytime sports viewing. With four HDMI 2.1 ports with up to 144Hz support, it’s also a great TV for gaming. Sure, it’s pricier than some other mini-LED options, but today's discounts at Samsung are as good as any we've seen so far. This is an amazing price on a mid-size display if you want to add a budget 4K TV to your home. The best-selling Insignia 43-inch TV features 4K HD resolution, smart capabilities with the Fire operating system, and a voice remote with hands-free Alexa, so you can use your voice to control your TV. Save $130 on the brand-new 55-inch TCL TV that supports high-quality 4K resolution, has smart capabilities with the Fire operating system, and a voice remote with hands-free Alexa controls. It's hard to believe that you can get all that for a cent under $200 – although it was down to $180 for Black Friday. It's still unbelievable value for money for a mid-sized everyday display though. Samsung's sale ahead of Cyber Monday has dropped this 55-inch Q60D QLED TV to an incredible price of just $629.99. The Q60D features 4K and Quantum HDR Smart technology with Motion Xcelerator, resulting in bright colors and realistic images. Its slim design also means it looks great in any living room. Amazon's all-new Fire TV Omni QLED Series is a big step up in the otherwise cheap range of smart TVs. This set boasts premium features, including a QLED display, full-array local dimming, Dolby Vision IQ, and HDR10+ Adaptive support to deliver a high-quality picture for all-around viewing and gaming. A good overall buy for the budget-conscious who don't want to compromise on performance, especially now that it's down to a record-low price of $599.99. The Sony Bravia 8 is back at its lowest price yet ahead of Cyber Monday. As one of the best TVs for sound, it's an ideal choice if you want stellar sound without paying extra for a soundbar. Its OLED screen might not be the brightest of them all, but it still manages to rival the picture quality of its competitors using its brightness-boosting Bravia XP Processor. You can even use it with your gaming console of choice thanks to the two HDMI ports (out of four total) that support 4K/120 Hz gaming. A 65-inch 4K smart TV for $379.99 is an incredible deal to snag ahead of Cyber Monday. The LG UT70 Series TV delivers a premium picture experience with brilliant colors thanks to LG's α5 Gen7 AI processor and WebOS 24 for seamless streaming. Gamers will also love the game optimizer and dashboard with GeForce NOW, which allows you to see and adjust all your settings in one place. If you're looking for a big-screen budget display, Best Buy has this 75-inch 4K TV on sale for $549.99. This entry-level TV from Samsung packs a solid 'Crystal' UHD 4K processor, an easy-to-use Tizen operating system, and full HDR support all for under $600. That's good value for money if you need a straightforward but capable display for your everyday viewing and media streaming. The Samsung S90D is the newest version of the five-star-rated Samsung S90C so it carries many of the same qualities and features that made the original one of the best TVs you can buy. These include terrific overall picture quality, impressive levels of brightness, rich contrast and colors, and industry-leading performance for watching movies, enjoying shows and smooth gaming. This offer brings the 65-inch version of the display down to a new record-low price. The Hisense U7N is an affordable mini-LED TV that provides serious bang for your buck, packing great features and performance into a budget package. It supports all HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, comes packed with gaming features, including 4K, 144Hz, and Dolby Vision gaming, and uses Google TV as its smart TV platform. This Cyber Monday deal takes the 75-inch model to under $1,000 – for a TV with this much to offer at this much size, this is a superb deal. ^ Back to all deals Bissell portable carpet cleaners have become the breakout stars at holiday sales like Cyber Monday, and the top-rated Little Green model is currently on sale for $81.49. Perfect for pet owners and parents, the portable carpet cleaner can magically erase spills and stains on carpets, couches, auto interiors, and more. If you're on a budget but still want a high-end vacuum, Dyso's V8 Absolute is a fantastic option at just $299.99. Perfect for pet owners, the Dyson V8 features a de-tangling motor bar that works across hardwood floors and carpets and can transform into a handheld vac for quick and convenient clean-ups. Amazon has the top-rated iRobot Roomba robot vacuum on sale for $149.99 - the lowest price we've ever seen. Designed with homes with pets in mind, the Roomba features three levels of powerful suction for custom cleaning on carpets and hard floors and recharges itself when the battery is low. The top-rated Tineco cordless wet-dry vacuum mop combo is on sale for a record-low price of $99 at Walmart's sale ahead of Cyber Monday. The Tineco iFloor 2 vacuums and washes hard floors in one step, handling wet and dry messes in one sweep. Dyson cordless vacuums are always Cyber Monday best-sellers, and Walmart has the powerful V12 on sale for $399.99 - a record-low price. The V12 is Dyson's lightest cordless vacuum and features illumination technology that reveals invisible dust on hard floors so you don't leave anything behind. The ultra-light Bissell CleanView vacuum features a compact size, making it easy to store if you're working in a small space. The Bissell vacuum also features powerful suction and a triple-action brush roll to pick up pet hair seamlessly. Today's deal ahead of Cyber Monday from Amazon brings the price down to just $59.99 - a record-low price. Here's a deal ahead of Cyber Monday on a Roomba robot vacuum mop combo, bringing the price down to its lowest ever. The j5 uses the iRobot Home App to create no-mop zones, so it will vacuum your hard floors while mopping at the same time but will avoid your carpet. Amazon has the top-rated Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum on sale for $299.99—just $4 shy of the record low. It offers powerful suction, and the inclusion of a self-emptying base solves one of the big irritations of robot vacuums, which is that they need to be emptied more often than uprights. Here's a huge $440 discount on a powerful and advanced robot vacuum from big-name brand iRobot. We praised its ability to pick up dirt from carpet and hard floors, and its self-charging feature in our iRobot Roomba J7 Plus review plus the convenient self-emptying bin. It is a bit noisy and sometimes struggles with larger debris but this is a good overall option. ^ Back to all deals If you're looking for a budget laptop, Walmart's Cyber Monday sale has HP's 14-inch laptop for just $129 – an incredible price. For that money, you're getting an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB of SSD, and up to 10 hours of battery life. Here it is, folks - the best deal yet on the latest Dell XPS 13. Complete with a brand-new Snapdragon X Elite chipset, this model is capable of not just exceptional day-to-day performance, but also battery life that's simply a cut-above what Windows laptops usually offer. Alongside superb specs, the latest XPS 13 also features a gorgeous lightweight design and a display that's perfect for both work and casual everyday use. It's hard to find a better cheap laptop deal in the early Cyber Monday sales than this Inspiron 15. It's nothing fancy, but this machine manages to pack in both a powerful Ryzen 5 chipset and a sizeable 512GB SSD in for just $300 - that's not bad to say the least. While you're only getting 8GB of RAM here, this is still a good choice if you're just looking for a cost-effective machine to cover the basics. I almost never see a laptop with 8GB of RAM for under $200, so this HP Chromebook 15 is a huge bargain in the Best Buy sale ahead of Cyber Monday. Even with that added performance, it's still a fairly basic device best suited to light use and schoolwork. That's backed up even more with the lean ChromeOS powering it and exceptional all-day battery life, making it an excellent portable option at a stunningly affordable price. This is the best discount I've seen on the new Microsoft Surface Pro – and it's a tempting buy after we were super-impressed in our Surface Pro 11 review. This version boasts a gorgeous 13-inch PixelSense Flow OLED display at 2880 x 1920 resolution so it looks sharp and crisp with some vibrant colors and deep blacks. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon X Plus processor ensures excellent battery life and combines well with its many AI features to simplify your life. There’s also 16GB of memory and 512GB of SSD storage which will ensure speedy performance and enough storage space for your essential files and applications. Dell's Cyber Monday deals on the higher-end XPS 13 models are also amazing this week. Take this Ultra 7 configuration, for example, a massive $400 price cut makes this one a lot easier on the pocket. While I wouldn't immediately recommend a machine with 32GB of RAM to everyone (it's overkill for most), this is a great choice for a professional-grade laptop. Best Buy has a great Cyber Monday deal on the excellent MacBook Air M2. Even though a newer M3 version is available, we concluded that this is still one of the best laptops you can buy in our MacBook Air M2 review, thanks to the stylish design, clear display, impressive performance, and long 18-hour battery life. For those needing a premium powerhouse for creative apps such as photo editing, video editing and more intense workloads, this is a near-unbeatable offer on an Apple machine right now - and one I don't see going any lower thanks to the Best Buy Holiday price guarantee. Display - 14 inchesProcessor - Apple M4RAM - 16GBStorage - 512GBOS - macOS Want to get your hands on the latest Apple hardware? We don't blame you, considering how efficient the M4 architecture is. Our MacBook Pro M4 review labeled it "one of the best Pro laptops" for a reason: it's extremely performant, got a base RAM bump from 8GB to 16GB, has that gorgeous inimitable Apple look to it, and have you seen that display? Absolutely stunning. ^ Back to all deals The Sony WH-1000MX4 are older now but they are still some of the best over-ear headphones ever. These wireless Sony cans package together top-notch audio, excellent comfort, and effective noise cancellation all at a reasonable price point that's about $100 less than the newer Sony XM5 that are only a minor upgrade. We still rate these as the best headphones for most people, exactly because you can find them at a price like this during major sales such as Cyber Monday. Sonos' inaugural over-ears are a no-brainer if you've got a Sonos Arc soundbar (with support for more Sonos soundbars to come), because that means incredibly detailed, immersive, head-tracked spatial audio for your movies and shows. We think at this price, they're far more competitive too. Will they dip an extra $20 (to their lowest ever price, seen oh-so-briefly in September)? We can't say for sure, but this $100 discount is not to be sniffed at – not for high-end headphones such as these. The Bose QuietComfort headphones are the manufacturer's mid-range noise-cancelling cans and have dropped to a record-low price in this deal ahead of Cyber Monday. On top of the manufacturer's excellent ANC to block out unwanted noise, you get high-fidelity audio and an EQ control to customize bass, mid-range, and treble. The QuietComfort lasts up to 24 hours on one charge and can get back 2.5 hours of playtime in 15 minutes. At the time of writing, only the Cypress Green colorway is discounted, but we actually love that finish. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 are a refinement of the previous model with AirPods-like ear sticks, active noise cancellation, a 11mm driver, and AI-powered features like a voice-call booster and a translation tool – providing you have a modern Samsung phone. They look and feel good in your ears too with up to 5 hours of battery life with ANC on, making them good for your commute or workout. And now you can get them for as little as $39.99 with a trade-in, that's a bargain. This is an incredible price for a pair of wireless on-ear headphones – on sale for just $24.95 at Amazon right now. The JBL Tune 510BT features Wireless Bluetooth 5.0 Streaming, so you can stream music and podcasts and take calls from your device, and you'll enjoy an impressive 40 hours of battery life. It's no t a model we've tested, but the JBL Tune 510BT have over 50,000 positive reviews on Amazon and are one of the best-selling headphones on the site. They also come with JBL's renowned Pure Bass sound. If you need something inexpensive and you need it now, it's hard to argue with this price tag… Some of Sony's best cheap headphones are on sale at Best Buy's big sale ahead of Cyber Monday. We particularly like this pair of cans as they offer a combination of good audio quality and impressive noise cancellation for the price. The Sony WHCH720N are the ones to bag if your budget doesn't stretch to the more premium XM5 but you still want a great pair of over-ears. The WF-C700N remain some of the best budget earbuds around, more than a year after their launch, especially now they've slipped to under $100 at Best Buy. Our five-star Sony WF-C700N review goes into why we rate them so highly, but the short version is that the mix of sound quality, noise cancellation power and comfort is basically unmatched. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are at their lowest price yet. This model of Bose's QuietComfort earbuds builds on the company's spatial audio technology with the all-new Immersive Audio feature and Snapdragon Sound certification, the latest standard in Bluetooth connectivity. In short, these are Bose's most advanced noise-cancelling earbuds you can buy. Quite simply the best in Sony's class-leading wireless over-ear lineup. The older XM4 headphones were outstanding, the XM3 cans before it were excellent, and it'll come as little surprise to know that Sony's XM5 proposition is also incredibly hard to beat – especially with a whopping 25% off, equalling their lowest-ever price! They don't fold up like the XM4 but, as a quick glance at our Sony WH-100XM5 review proves, there's not much else to pick fault with. A $100 discount is the biggest we've ever seen on these incredible headphones, matching their lowest price to date. With incredible sound quality, supreme comfort, and unrivalled active noise cancellation, you're guaranteed an incredible listening experience. The Beats Solo 4 were released in May 2024 and the price-cut listed on Amazon marks a return to their lowest ever price on record. This model supports lossless audio that you can listen to via USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable, and Spatial Audio that uses head tracking to enhance your listening experience. These headphones also last up to 50 hours on a single charge and can regain five hours of playback time in just 10 minutes of charging. Not bad overall for the new budget price point, we think you'll agree… ^ Back to all deals Looking to buy a smart speaker for a small space? Amazon's Cyber Monday deals include the all-new Echo Pop for just $17.99 - the cheapest Echo device you can buy right now. For that money, you're getting a compact smart speaker with Alexa built-in, so you can play music, ask questions, and check the weather completely hands-free. Amazon's brand new Echo Spot pairs a 2.83-inch touch with a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker, which might make it the ideal smart alarm clock. With Alexa onboard, you can ask the assistant for the weather, play music, or even schedule alarms. Today's Cyber Monday deal is a return to the record-low price. If you're looking for more robust sound, Amazon's Cyber Monday deals also include the Echo Dot for its lowest price. Amazon's best-selling smart speaker offers an improved audio experience, plus a new temperature sensor and all the handy features from Alexa, like playing music, answering questions, and checking the weather completely hands-free. Amazon's best-selling Echo Show 5 is on sale for a whopping 50% discount. The 2023 Echo Show 5 features a compact 5.5-inch display but packs impressive sound with deeper bass and clearer vocals. With Amazon Alexa, you can listen to podcasts, movies, music, and more. If you're looking for a larger smart home display, Amazon has the latest Echo Show 8 on sale for a new record-low price of $79.99. Thanks to Alexa compatibility, the eight-inch display allows you to make calls, watch movies, check the weather, and control compatible smart home devices completely hands-free. I already own the best-selling Ring Video Doorbell and can't imagine living without it. The smart doorbell includes a built-in battery and allows you to see, hear, and speak to anyone from your phone or computer. Today's Cyber Monday deal from Amazon is a record-low price. Amazon's Cyber Monday sale has the top-rated Blink Video Doorbell on sale for its lowest price ever. The Blink doorbell alerts you when motion is detected and features infrared night video, two-way audio, and long-lasting battery life - all for $29.99. I've had my eye on the Blink Mini 2 since its release, and now that it's on sale for just $19.99 - it's a must-buy. The compact security camera features two-way audio and will alert your phone when motion is detected. The Blink 2 also includes a 1080p HD live view, night view in color with a built-in spotlight, and a wider field of view. The 4th generation Blink outdoor security camera features enhanced motion detection, two-way audio, a two-year battery life, and works with Amazon Alexa for hands-free control. Today's Cyber Monday deal is a massive 58% discount and a record-low price. Today's Cyber Monday deals at Amazon has the Ring Stick Up Cam on sale for $54.99 - the cheapest price we've ever seen. The Alexa-enabled security camera features motion-activated notifications and two-way talk and can be placed indoors or outdoors. Add smart capabilities to any device in your home with the best-selling Amazon Smart Plug on sale for just $12.99. With over 500,000 positive reviews on Amazon, the smart plug works with Amazon Alexa, so you can turn on lights and appliances using just your voice. The new version of Amazon's standard Fire TV Stick is half-price at Amazon's Cyber Monday sale, bringing the price down to a record low. In our Fire TV Stick review, we found the original version was a cheap way to add essential smart features to your TV, including access to streaming apps in HD, Alexa voice controls, and the ability to control other smart home devices. As the name suggests, the Fire TV Stick 4K streams shows and movies on your TV in ultra-high definition 4K resolution. It's a good offer for a solid streaming stick that comes with access to all the major apps and supports voice controls through Alexa. This offer matches the previous record-low price we saw during last year's Prime Day so it's worth buying now as we likely won't see a better offer this year. This is the lowest price we've seen for Amazon's premium streaming device. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max streams the same content in the same quality as the standard 4K version, but the extra power inside means faster performance when navigating apps. Plus, it uses WiFi 6E technology to give you a more stable and consistent streaming experience. ^ Back to all deals ^ Back to all deals Disney Plus and Hulu annual ad-supported plan: was $10.99 per month now $2.99 at Hulu and Disney PlusBoth Disney Plus and Hulu's ad-supported plans are normally just under $11 dollars a month for a bundle, but you can now get them both for $2.99 a month, representing a saving of more than 72% on annual plan. Sadly, you'll have to watch commercials on both streaming services, but with a saving of over $200 on offer compared to if you bought both services separately, we suspect you'll think it's a price worth paying. Offer ends on December 3. Hulu with ads or ad-free plans: was $17.99 for one-month now $0 at HuluLike the bundle offers above, this introductory deal is not part of the Cyber Monday sales but it's a great way to try out Hulu. New and eligible returning customers can try out Hulu's on-demand plans with a 30-day Hulu free trial, which is four times longer than its usual 7-day free trial offer. Thereafter, you'll have to pay $7.99 a month for its with-ads plan, or $17.99 a month to cut out the commercials. A free trial has also returned for its Hulu with Live TV plan. New subscribers can try the cord cutting service for 3 days. Find out more about how to get a Hulu free trial in our guide. Peacock 'Premium' plan: was $79.99 for 12-months now $19.99 at PeacockThis is what streaming deals are about: getting a new discounted subscription that will last you until next year's sales and this Peacock Cyber Monday offer does exactly that. The 75% saving is also available for a monthly subscription, but with more than 80,000 hours of content available, you'll definitely need more time to get through its big catalog and this way you'll also have an account for upcoming live sporting events. Use the code 'REALDEAL' at the checkout before the deal ends on December 2. Hulu, Disney Plus and Max bundle: was $29.99 for three-months now $16.99 at HuluThis offers gets you the all-new mega bundle, which includes Hulu, Disney Plus and Max subscriptions, for three-months for 43% off buying each service on its own. This isn't a Cyber Monday deal – it's just the regular bundle price – but it's good to know about. One thing to note is that this bundle offer only applies to each service's ad-supported plan so don't expect to find premium features as part of this bundle. But you do unlock access to the best Disney Plus movies, the best Disney Plus shows, the best Max shows and the best Max movies alongside great Hulu's great content library. Paramount Plus add-on to Prime Video: was $15.98 for two-months now $5.98 at AmazonWith this limited time Cyber Monday offer, you can get two months of Paramount Plus as a subscription add-on for just $2.99 a month. That means you can sign up for the 30-day free Amazon Prime trial, which gives you access to Prime Video, and only spend an extra $2.99 to unlock access to one of the world's best streaming services for more than half the usual price. This offer ends on December 2 and is for the Paramount Plus 'Essential' plan, which means you'll have to put up with ads. Max 'Ultimate ad-free' annual plan: was $251.88 now $209.99 at MaxWith a choice of three plans (with ads, ad-free and ultimate ad-free), get gritty Warner Bros. movies and TV shows, as well as easy entertainment from Discovery's library of reality TV in one. Starting from $9.99 a month for its with ads plan, why not subscribe straight up for a whole year and save up to 16% across all three plans available. This isn't really a Cyber Monday deal, but it's an offer worth considering. Starz Hulu-add on: was $10.99 a month now $0.99 per month at HuluHulu's ad-supported price is normally just under $10 a month, but as part of its Cyber Monday offer, you can pick it up for a steal at $0.99 a month. Then, you can add 12 months' worth of Starz onto that for an additional $0.99 per month. Two premium streamers for $1.98 for six months? We consider that quite the bargain. ESPN Plus annual plan: was $119.99 now $99.99 at ESPN PlusAs the home of live sports and games for the likes of MLB, NFL and more as well as the network's studio shows, movies and documentaries, ESPN Plus offers a big library of on-demand entertainment, which you can subscribe to for 12 months for 16% off with this Cyber Monday deal. The offer is available for new and returning customers and expires on December 12. This deal is likely to be the last of its kind as Disney is launching a stand-alone ESPN flagship streaming service in 2025. At that point, you'll need to consider all your plans and prices once again. ^ Back to all deals The PS5 Pro itself remains in steady stock in the US with a whole host of retailers offering ways to buy the upgraded console. Also in stock at: $699.99 at Target | $699.99 at Walmart | $699.99 at Best Buy | $699.99 at PlayStation Direct If you're after the best-value PS5 Slim console as well as the best-value bundle, then this Fortnite Cobalt Star listing at Walmart is the way to go. There have been savings galore for the Xbox Series X Digital Edition this Black Friday. And rightly so, as I feel its retail price is a touch on the pricey side given the lack of a disc drive. It's certainly more compelling below that $400 mark. Sadly there's no bundle here, but still a decent saving for the console itself. This is the best discount on a PS5 DualSense right now, and it's a lowest price on the Cosmic Red colorway since last Cyber Monday! If you're looking for an affordable wireless Nintendo Switch controller right now, then your best bet is this more budget-friendly option from PowerA. Discounted by $21, this isn't quite the lowest-ever price but it's still a good lower-cost alternative to the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. With fast performance for a smartwatch and a sleek design, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is instantly likeable. And now you can save up to $175 when you trade in your current device – alongside a flat $40 discount. Samsung's latest wearable provides more precise heart rate tracking than previous models, while it also helps you monitor how stressed you are and how well you’re sleeping. Think of it as your personal assistant on your wrist and you’re not far off. It even suggests how to respond to messages and notifications. Last year's best Fitbit Inspire 3 deal has returned to its lowest-ever price of $69.95, $30/30% off the usual list price of $99.95. Available in both colors, you'll get 24/7 heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and notifications from your communication apps. This might be Amazon's best deal ahead of Cyber Monday - Apple's all-new Apple Watch 10 on sale for a new record-low price of $329. The Apple Watch 10 includes upgrades such as Apple's new S10 chipset, sleep apnea detection, depth gauge, and a new design featuring the most advanced display. I don't expect you'll find a better price on Cyber Monday, and this offer is in danger of being sold out. Get $100 off Garmin's brilliant Vivoactive 5, now down to its lowest-ever price of $199. Available in four great colors it comes with 11 days of battery life and tracking for sleep, activity, heart rate, and more.

It's now $100 and down to a new lowest-ever price of $349 at Amazon. Get an impressive 24% off an already excellently-priced watch in the Amazon sales of Cyber Monday. The FE is Samsung's equivalent of an Apple Watch SE (a watch that boasts up-to-date software and performs very well, but doesn't have the latest hardware innovations) only even cheaper. A great buy for anyone with a Samsung phone. I'm TechRadar's lead for US deals and TV discounts, and I've been doing this for the last six years. I have a lot more experience than that, though – I've worked in ecommerce for 11 years. No one has combed through more deals than me, I promise you. When it comes to cheap laptops, the official Dell Store is always a good shout over Cyber Monday. 2024 is no different in this regard considering you can pick up this heavily discounted Dell Inspiron 15 today. Not only does this one feature a Ryzen 5-7520U chipset for speedy peformance, but you're also getting a decently sized 512GB SSD here too. In short, this is a great choice for covering the basics. Dell Inspiron 15 laptop: was $449.99 now $299.99 at Dell It's now past Midnight ET, so Walmart's official Cyber Monday sale is over. The good news is that Best Buy and Amazon still have Cyber Monday deals available, and I'm still highlighting tonight's best offers.

Walmart is the only retailer that still has the M1 model for sale, and at just $599, it's an absolute steal.While the MacBook Air M1 is an older model (released in 2021), the 13-inch laptop still packs Apple's powerful M1 chip, 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and up to 18 hours of battery life.Apple MacBook M1: was $699 now $599 at Walmart It's hard not to recommend Sony's excellent WH-1000XM5, which are some of the best over-ear headphones you can buy. The previous model was already outstanding, but the XM5 are even better. We generally recommend the XM4 instead, because the difference is not that great given the higher price, but today's Cyber Monday deal at Amazon makes it a harder decision, with a whopping 25% off the newer model. If you do want to go for the XM4 instead, they're a full $100 cheaper, also at Amazon. Tough choices await!Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399.99 now $298 at Amazon Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399.99 now $198 at Amazon Gamers rejoice!

The 42mm Apple Watch Series 10 is just $329 (originally $399), and the larger 46mm is only $359 (originally $429).

A lot of us – and I'm sure many of you too – pinned a lot of hopes on big discounts during those Amazon-exclusive sales. And there wasn't much to be excited about at all. At least there's been some improvement in the Cyber Monday sales, with both the latest Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite getting their first-ever price cuts. Sure, both ereaders are nowhere near as cheap as I've seen previous versions in the past, but these are still decent offers for the new and improved models with bigger screens and longer battery life. I'm confident in saying these will likely be the best offers we see until at least July next year, so don't miss your chance to get a discount before the Amazon Cyber Monday sale ends later tonight. Kindle: was $109.99 now $84.99 at AmazonKindle Paperwhite: was $159.99 now $129.99 at Amazon There's one Cyber Monday deal ending tonight that you need to see above the rest. It's this offer on Hulu that's already proved tremendously popular over the last few days. And, honestly, I can see why. You can pay just $0.99 per month for a Hulu subscription with ads, which saves you almost $100 over a year's membership. There's also an option to bundle it with Disney Plus for a measly $2.99 a month – another huge bargain for both streaming services. This one ends today, though, so it's definitely one I'd pull the trigger on as soon as possible. ENDS TONIGHT – Get Hulu for $0.99 per month This would make a GREAT stocking stuffer idea – the wildly popular Apple AirTag 4-pack is on sale for its lowest price yet.The Apple AirTag is a handy Bluetooth location-tracking device that pairs with your iPhone.

Title: I'd leave the Xbox controller on its shelf this Cyber Monday and buy this $35 gamepad instead

Do you really need a wireless controller? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The GameSir G7 SE is meant to be a budget controller that you can get for cheap, but I don't think it's supposed to be better than the official gamepad that comes in your Xbox's box. GameSir clearly didn't understand that assignment though, because although it has a cutesie look and an unassuming face, it's a fully-fledged pro controller for Xbox and PC that I'd easily recommend over Microsoft's version. It's also blissfully cheap thanks to Cyber Monday sales at the moment. Reduced from its $45 regular price, it's down to $35.99 at Amazon. That saving applies to all of its colorways, including the white, eggshell model I tested for review, as well as the Blue, Orange, and Purple versions that have been released since. Rather annoyingly, this Cyber Monday Xbox deal is a Prime exclusive, but luckily there's an offer on the retail page to take out a 30-day free trial if you aren't already a member. I've spotted the G7 SE drop down to this price a few times now, and it's always one I'd recommend to people looking for a spare controller to throw into their rotation because there's amazing value to be had from it. GameSir G7 SE | $44.99 $35.99 at AmazonSave $10 - A $10 reduction on an already very affordable controller is never a bad thing, and for your money here, you get two back buttons, audio controls, deadzone customization, and great ergonomics. Buy it if: ✅ You want a controller with back buttons✅ You don't mind a wired connection✅ You like a smaller-feeling controller Don't buy it if: ❌ You prefer larger, heavier controllers❌ You want color options GameSir doesn't provide UK: £39 at Amazon Whether you're a PC gamer looking for a controller to occasionally use in games that require one, or you're an Xbox player needing something up a level from the stock Wireless controller, the GameSir G7 SE is a great option. It's one of the more affordable Xbox pro controllers out there today, but it's still one of the first I'll look for when it comes to the likes of Black Friday and Prime Day because its features give even the expensive ones a run for their money. Two back buttons can make a huge difference after you spend a bit of time getting used to them. They mean you don't have to rely on quick thumb movements for all of your in-game functions, and in first-person games you don't need to take your thumbs off the sticks as much, resulting in better aim and movement. The back buttons here are placed beautifully so you don't need to adjust your natural grip to press them - they fall right under your middle fingers. GameSir was also one of the first brands to really embrace the anti-stick drift movement by adopting Hall Sensor thumbsticks in all of its products. If you've been burned by one too many cheap gamepads that have broken down over time, this is a brand I think you really need to know about. I've tested its best PC controllers over hundreds of hours at this point, and they're some of the most reliable I've ever used. The Windows app you can use to customize their deadzones, button mapping, and more is really impressive too. Of course, the one drawback to this controller is that it came out before Xbox relaxed its licensing parameters, and as a result, it can only work with your PC or Xbox with a wired connection. There is a 3m cable in the box here, but if that's going to be a dealbreaker, maybe check out one of the other best Xbox Series X controllers. There are more deals where that came from. Check out some Cyber Monday gaming PC deals, Cyber Monday Meta Quest deals, and Cyber Monday gaming chair deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote The keyboard alternative that made me a better speedrunner is on sale for Black Friday Are mobile controllers too small for your hands?

Title: It Used to Be One of the Main Ways Men Talked to Each Other. Then Everyone Went Silent.

Time Published: 2024-12-01T15:00:00Z

In 2005 I received a copy of World of Warcraft for my birthday. The game clocked in at 3 gigabytes—a behemoth by the standards of the early 2000s, so big that it had to be distributed across four different CDs. I installed those discs onto our creaking, overworked family PC and, hours later, created my first avatar: a humble dwarf paladin named Pumaras, who set off to explore a realm he would soon call home. World of Warcraft was a singular experience, and completely unlike the lonesome corridors of Halo or Call of Duty. Millions of living, breathing human beings logged on to the game at the same time. They were dispersed across a massive digital landscape—digging up treasure, exploring catacombs, and, most importantly, creating a flourishing social milieu in the chat box at the bottom of the screen. Few feats could be accomplished by yourself in this place. Do you want to slay the dragon brooding at the summit of Blackrock Mountain? Then you must band together with a small army of fellow combatants to stand a chance. Need to stock up on some health potions? Then you’ll be bartering with someone who has mastered the alchemical arts. That was the magic of World of Warcraft. Play long enough and you’ll be enmeshed in a nation. You’ll find fellowship and rivalry. You might even make pals for life. And I did. I played World of Warcraft nearly every day until I left for college, and as Pumaras scoured the map for adventure, he soon found communion with a small cadre of ride-or-die cohorts. Some were around my age, others were considerably older, but all of us were united in a sublime trinity of priorities: kill monsters, gain loot, and make jokes until the wee hours of the morning. It’s been too long for me to remember how I originally met those friends, but that’s the point. World of Warcraft was designed to function like a social organ: You’d see the same players congregating in its capital cities, searching for compatriots to join them on their next dungeon crawl. With time, those mercenary contacts cohered into something deeper and more real. Our usernames were saved in each other’s respective friends lists, and before long, we were chopping it up on voice chat. I was a lonely teenager in some respects, but my life in World of Warcraft was rich. I had friends in North Carolina, Arkansas, and Sydney. I didn’t know much about their inner lives, but we had the most important thing in common: We wanted to conquer the world, and we wanted to do it together. World of Warcraft still exists in 2024. The game’s 10th expansion was released in August, and while it doesn’t command quite the same influence as it did during its early-millennium prime, millions of players still step through its portal every day. But the dynamic I’m describing—the complex social contract, the acquaintances waiting to be forged into brotherhood—is nowhere to be found. The chat box that used to chirp with shitposts, gossip, and hyperlocal banter is conspicuously barren. If you do partner up with someone for an adventure, words are rarely exchanged. When the final boss is toppled, everyone leaves the group and dissolves into the ether. It used to be something of a faux pas to play without a microphone, but I honestly can’t remember the last time one of my fellow dwarves has beckoned me to join a voice channel. This is part of a shift that can be felt across video game culture writ large. Even though some of the biggest franchises in the world—Fortnite, Call of Duty, League of Legends—pit a server’s worth of players against one another in lethal combat, the softer interactions those places once fomented are on the decline. We are all in front of our computers, paradoxically together and separate, like ships passing in the night. This is a difficult trend to prove empirically, but it certainly has been felt by lifelong gamers. There are multiple somber YouTube video essays about the lack of conviviality in multiplayer lobbies, and most of them bear titles that gesture toward an elemental wound in the culture. (One video, titled “Modern Gaming Is Becoming More and More Isolated,” has over 500,000 views.) A similar despondence has struck the domains of Reddit and GameFAQs, which have historically served as the premier watering holes for fans of the hobby. (“No one uses voice chat these days,” wrote one user. “People don’t chat in gaming anymore,” added another.) On a more macro level, about half of Americans are currently experiencing loneliness, particularly among millennials and Gen Z, who represent the industry’s primary consumers. All of this is evidence of a generation that has come to believe that a reliable source of intimacy—even if it’s down the scope of a sniper rifle—has gone awry. I would find it pathetic if I didn’t totally relate. Nina Freeman, a game designer and Twitch streamer, crystalized this sensation perfectly in her 2015 project Cibele. The game, which draws heavily from Freeman’s own life, allows the player to watch a World of Warcraft–like friendship bloom in real time. You take control of a girl who has met a stranger in the wide-open plains of a multiplayer RPG. As they cull monsters and empty coffers, the two souls grow closer—eventually falling in love. Cibele is an attempt to mirror the warmth that can be found between avatars. If it has a fundamental principle, it’s that video games can reveal surprising vulnerability when two people are in the same place with a common task. That, more than anything else, is what those GameFAQs threads are mourning. “I think [games like World of Warcraft] can affect one’s willingness to open up to someone. You don’t have to deal with the layer of bodies. You don’t have to worry about the physical barrier. All of that is stripped away when you’re speaking through a video game,” said Freeman. “So I do think digital spaces are sometimes good at bringing people together, and make connecting easier. There is room for a closeness to develop when all you can do is talk.” I never had a multiplayer romance, but like Freeman, when I think back on those days, the memories that surface have little to do with nuts-and-bolts gameplay. All of the dungeons we cleared served as a backdrop for long, elliptical moonlit conversations that teenage boys in the mid-2000s tended to have (Radiohead, the Iraq war, the comedy stylings of Dane Cook). Mitchell Winkie, a screenwriter in Los Angeles and my brother, was also a degenerate World of Warcraft sicko in his youth, and he recalls a moment when—after a long night in one of the game’s most daunting battlefields—he told his party leader that he needed to go to bed. “I brush my teeth, shut down my computer, and my fucking Razr phone rings,” he told me. “It’s my party leader, who is begging me to log back on, in a very sweet, not-scary way, just desperate because they don’t have enough man power to kill the final boss.” Sure enough, Mitchell popped out of bed and put his talents to use. “I don’t think anything dropped for me, but I was a minor hero,” he continued. “And, looking back, obviously everyone knew I was such a young kid from my squeaky voice, but they all treated me very kindly and big-brotherly in a way I’ll never forget.” Still, the positive social interactions players have found in video games over the years are easily outweighed by the negative ones. What is the cultural stereotype of a Call of Duty match on Xbox Live? Slurs, obscenities, and heavy-duty profanity, whipsawing back and forth at impossibly loud volumes. (I am reminded of this clip, in which a bright-eyed kid asks the rest of his team, in a prepubescent voice, how much candy they got for Halloween. Someone instantly shouts back, “Shut the fuck up!”) This problem is intensified further if you are gaming while not—precisely—a white heterosexual male. Racial epithets are commonplace, alongside standard-issue dude-bro misogyny. When the Anti-Defamation League surveyed this issue, it found that more than half of gamers have faced some form of discrimination in multiplayer settings. So I was not surprised when Freeman told me that these days she seldom switches her microphone on during gaming sessions. “I play a lot of DOTA, and I’ve had it on anonymous mode for the last year,” she said, referring to an anti-harassment feature that automatically prevents other players from sending her in-game chat messages, or seeing her username at all. This is the standard diagnosis for why video games have gotten less social. These arenas are rife with disruptive hate that can be difficult to moderate, so players have responded by turning inward. Ian Larson, a sociologist at the University of California, Irvine, who studies video games, notes that the public squares in this hobby have largely moved off game servers and ensconced themselves on Discord—a platform that allows the creation of private chat servers for curated segments of the population. Within a Discord sanctum, argues Larson, players are able to fill their need for social interaction without wandering into the disarray of the digital public. “I know people who have game communities formed around a podcast they listen to, or a sports team they like,” said Larson. “I think people have found Discord to be more tuned to what they’re looking for than just going out into the wild.” Joanna Lewis, at the University of Northern Colorado, researches the relationship between video games and loneliness and takes this premise even further. Lewis argues that the generation eager to play a massively multiplayer online video game in 2005 was itself a uniquely self-selecting group—akin to the Discord communities of today. I think she’s onto something. My early World of Warcraft friends were curious about the emergent technology represented by the game, and perhaps more willing to actualize its metaversal possibility. It was genuinely exotic to go online and communicate with a stranger at the turn of the century, but we simply do not have that relationship with the internet anymore. Everyone is on the internet now, and naturally, that has brought a much more unwieldy influx of humanity into digital environs. “We’re being exposed to everyone’s perspective,” said Lewis. “That can be good, and it can be bad, but it’s made people a bit more cautious about what we open ourselves up to.” The downside of this drift is that game designers have made an effort to purge the social faculties from their products. There was a time when a World of Warcraft dungeon run required a tight balance of coordination and logistics, actions that could be fostered only through rapid-fire communication. Today, though, much of the game is intended for solo play. (One of the defining features of the game’s latest expansion is a new archetype of content, called Delves, that can be completed all by yourself.) This issue is even more glaring in games like Call of Duty, in which the primary means of interacting with strangers is to gun them down and rip the resources from their bodies. To me, this reads as a tacit concession that most gamers regard one another as nuisances to be subjugated, rather than potential collaborators. And maybe that issue can be solved only by rewiring the playing field and creating more incentives for players to be good to one another. Larson believes that this isn’t as hard as it looks. He points to Final Fantasy XIV, a game similar to World of Warcraft, which is buoyed by a mentorship program. Newcomers can be taken under the wings of more experienced players, an experience that rewards each of them with tangible in-game benefits. “You just want to create little buds that might sprout eventually,” he said. Freeman cites a more outré example. The 2012 classic Journey featured an abstract take on multiplayer where, during a grueling expedition through a psychedelic desert, you might come across another traveler, who becomes connected to your game. The two characters cannot impede or harass their partner, nor can they communicate outside of a few rudimentary sounds. The only asset they can functionally provide is companionship, which is far more interesting than yet another headshot. “You’re taking away the words, and sometimes taking away people’s ability to speak can be good,” said Freeman. “But that shouldn’t be the end-all, be-all. There should be a way to improve that.” In fact, Freeman believes that the silence that has struck video games runs parallel to the toxicity and distrust seeping into all corners of digital culture. Pessimism about the internet is at an all-time high. The consensus states that the web is a place of rampant misinformation and vicious harassment. It is destroying democracy. It has made us lonelier and more paranoid. It is where decency goes to die. So why do I hold out hope that things could be different? To keep the faith that the internet can, indeed, be a kind and loving place? Simple: I’ve seen it myself. I may not have solutions, but I do know that the world is a better place when a dwarf and an elf can meet in the whirring gears of a multiplayer server and, shortly afterward, become best friends. Surely, we can’t be so far away from reclaiming that dream. “We were early users of this weird social construct of talking online through avatars,” said Freeman. “All of this stuff has become a fixture of the mainstream fabric of life. We have to find ways to deal with this problem, because it’s not going away. We need to make it better, rather than moving away from it altogether.” Thanks for signing up!

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Jump straight to the deals you want...1. Quick links2. PCG's top products3. Today's top deals4. Deal hubs5. Live updates That's it, Black Friday is well and truly done. But just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in to give you peak Cyber Monday gaming deals realness. Sure, we've got a guide going over the full range of the best Cyber Monday PC gaming deals, but I'm here to give you that personal touch, and highlight the deals as they pop up and give you the cream of the crop. Crops have cream, right? Like, oats have milk. I digress. As Cyber Monday begins properly today, and Cyber Week goes on beyond that, we've already seen a bunch of last week's deals either go out of stock or rise to the point where we no longer recommend them. BUT that's not to say that they won't be back. What we often see is that specific Black Friday deals that might have gone 'off sale' over the weekend get picked up again on Cyber Monday and sold as fresh deals. But, y'know, with the same price. There will also be some genuinely fresh deals cropping up over the next few days as Cyber Week cracks on. Already I've found a couple of good gaming laptops and gaming PCs that weren't around just a few days ago. There are also some actually great handheld gaming PC deals, too. So, if you've been itching to get on the mobile gaming bandwagon there literally has never been a better time. So, if you're in the mood to either treat yourself, or make sure you get your Christmas shopping done early, and with a smattering of solid discounts to make your money go further, stay with me as I'm going to keep on hunting out the best tech deals this Cyber Week and posting them here. We'll also be regularly updating our Cyber Monday deal hubs throughout this time, but this is where I want to highlight here my absolute favorite PC gaming deals. But why me? Well, I've been doing this a long time. Way before Black Friday or Cyber Monday were fashionable—I mean, look, all the cool kids are doing it now—I was casting around to find you lovely people the best deals, and I've also been a technology journalist for over 19 years now so I've got a pretty good idea of what's good, what's not, and what's just some retailer or manufacturer trying to make a fast buck out of old stock. As well as the best deals, we're also tracking down the best prices on the key products from our full suite of product buying guides. We maintain those guides throughout the year, completely based on products we have reviewed ourselves and can absolutely stand by their continued excellence. Dave's been doing the PC hardware dance since back in 2005, and building gaming PCs since the '90s. You know, when it was difficult. In his time he's tested every type of PC component, peripheral, and accessory you can imagine, and probably some you can't. That makes him perfectly placed to recommend the best deals, and the ones you need to steer clear of this Black Friday. Nvidia GeForce-powered gaming PCs AMD Radeon-powered gaming PCs Gaming laptop deals Graphics card deals Gaming monitor deals 1. Yeyian Tanto | Intel Core i5 13400F | RTX 4070 Super | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,599.99 $1,199.99 at Newegg (save $400)Yeyian has a stellar deal on an RTX 4070 Super machine here. We've seen slightly cheaper versions on sale, but this one at least does have proper DDR5 memory, making the motherboard at least nominally upgradeable to a more modern spec. It does make a bit of an odd combo with the Core i5 here, though for straightforward gaming performance, it shouldn't prove any issue and deliver high frame rates. 2. Corsair TC100 | Fabric and leatherette | $249.99 $179.99 at Best Buy (save $70)The TC100 is our favorite affordable gaming chair right now, following up on the popular T3 Rush with a great look and genuine comfort. You can read more in our review. Right now, even with only a light discount, it's a truly excellent gaming chair that's cheaper than most of its competition. Price check: Corsair $179.99 | B&H Photo $179.99 (sold out) | Amazon $179.99 (sold out) 3. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 13400F | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,099 $749.99 at Newegg (save $349.01)This isn't the cheapest RTX 4060 gaming PC we've found this sales season, but this is the one that I'd be buying right now. While the other budget systems are similarly sporting last-gen CPUs, the Core i5 13400F is identical to the 14th Gen alternative, and faster than the Arrow Lake chips for gaming. Paired up with an RTX 4060 and 16 GB of relatively quick DDR5 memory makes this a great budget system. 4. MSI MAG 321UPX | 32-inch | 4K | 240 Hz | QD-OLED | $799.99 at Amazon (save $100)With its special launch price of $949, the MSI MAG 321UPX was already by far the cheapest of the new generation of gorgeous high-pixel density 4K gaming OLEDs. But you can already get for $50 off. It makes most 27-inch 1440p OLEDs look painfully overpriced. It may be out of stock when you click through, but it's worth checking back for this great deal. Price check: Newegg $799.99 (sold out) 5. MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super | 16 GB GDDR6X | 8,448 shaders | 2,655 MHz boost | $839.99 $739.99 at Amazon (save $100)The RTX 4070 Ti Super might be relatively new to the market, but we're still seeing some discounts on what is a very performant card. This model is very solid and comes with a triple fan cooler, and with the power of DLSS 3 makes for a mighty addition to any gaming rig. RTX 4070 Ti Super price check: Newegg $739.99 | Walmart $759.99 | Best Buy $799.99 6. MSI Vector 16 HX | RTX 4080 | Core i9 14900HX | 16-inch | 1600p | 240 Hz | 1 TB SSD | 32 GB RAM | $2,099 $1,849 at B&H (save $250)Of the two MSI Vector machines we've highlighted here, I'd rather this one. It has a newer, more powerful CPU, a better screen resolution and refresh rate for an RTX 4080, and 32 GB of RAM. Altogether, that makes for a pretty sweet package and an upgrade worth the extra $100 over the cheapest RTX 4080 laptop we've found so far. Price check: Microcenter $1,999.99 7. ASRock Phantom Gaming | 27-inch | 1080p | 165 Hz | IPS | $179.99 $99.77 at Newegg (save $79.22)ASRock has become a favorite of ours around here over busy shopping periods. These screens always seem to be on offer, and from the one we've used (read our review) they're good value for the money, too. You can't really complain with this 165Hz panel for just under $100. 8. HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless | 50 mm drivers | 15-21,000 Hz | Closed-back | Wireless | $199.99 $125.99 at Amazon (save $74)The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is one of our all-time favorite gaming headsets for many reasons, but there's a big headline feature to talk about here: 300-hour battery life. No, we didn't make a typo. 300 hours of gaming goodness on a single charge, excellent DTS:X Spatial Audio, and premium comfort features make this headset an absolute stunner of a buy at this price. In fact, when we reviewed it the only major negative we could find was a slightly uninspiring microphone. Absolutely worth a serious look this one, at any level of discount. Price check: Walmart $149.99 | Newegg $144.99 9. ASRock Challenger RX 7800 XT | 16 GB GDDR6 | 3,840 shaders | 2,475 MHz boost | $469.99 $449.99 at Newegg (save $20)At this price point, the best card used to be the RX 6800 XT but these days we have deals like this one, where the 7800 XT has the same price tag. It's only a little bit faster than the card it's replaced, but you're still getting a lotta GPU for the money. RX 7800 XT price check: | Best Buy $469.99 | Amazon $449.99 10. LG UltraGear 34GP63A-B | 34-inch | 3440 x 1440 | 165 Hz | VA | Curved | $399.99 $239.99 at Amazon (save $160)At its current price, this LG ultrawide is a genuine bargain. By comparison, Alienware's fancy QD-OLED 34-inch panel is around $800 even on sale. This LG matches its size, resolution, aspect ratio and refresh rate for less than one-third of the price, although of course, it is a VA panel, not an OLED. It's also not the brightest gaming monitor ever, but it is a very good deal. Price check: LG $239.99 The number of sub-$200 gaming monitors, that are both high refresh rate and with a 1440p native resolution is nuts. That used to be the preserve of much more expensive screens, but thanks to the Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals going down right now, you're getting big brand monitors on sale for often actually less than $150. Now, that's not exactly throw away money, but it's now a price where you could probably suck it up for the extra sharpness and Windows screen real estate you get with a 2560 x 1440 screen. And these are either IPS or VA panels, too, like actually good displays. These are five of the best still around: Acer KA272U | 27-inch | 1440p | 100 Hz | IPS | $199.99 $139.99 at Best Buy (save $60)If you're on the tightest of budgets, this will get you a decently sized 1440p monitor for a real bargain price. It's even got a higher-than-60 Hz refresh rate. Okay, 100 Hz isn't spectacular, but it is still notably smoother than 60 Hz. It's also not the brightest screen, rated at 250 nits peak, but the compromises will have to come in somewhere. If you want something brighter, the $145 ASRock below is a true winner. ASRock Phantom PG27Q15R2A | 27-inch | 1440p | 165 Hz | VA | $239.99 $142.77 at Newegg (save $97.22)ASRock's gaming monitors are always so darned cheap—we love them for that. This 1440p panel offers resolution and a rapid refresh rate for a potent PC gaming combo, though the built-in Wi-Fi antenna helps it stand out from the crowd. That's hardly essential, but could come in use for some. Acer Nitro ED270U | 27-inch | 1440p | 170 Hz | VA | $249.99 $149.99 at Newegg (save $100)This is one of the best deals on a 1440p gaming monitor we've seen so far. A respectable brand and a respectable spec, although it might be worth holding out for an IPS panel. Still, a good price on a great little screen. Price check: Amazon $184.10 Acer Nitro XV271U M3bmiiprx | 27-inch | 1440p | 180 Hz | IPS | $289.99 $169.99 at Amazon (save $120)This Acer monitor is a steal for all you prospective competitive gamers, hitting a high refresh rate and low response time sweet spot (0.5-1 ms gray-to-gray). It's the same price as the Odyssey G5 below but is better for those of you who prefer an IPS panel to a VA. Price check: Newegg $251 Samsung Odyssey G5 G55C | 27-inch | 1440p | 165 Hz | VA | Curved | $299.00 $195.99 at Newegg (save $104)This monitor was already a great deal at its previous price. Now, for well under $200 it's a steal. Samsung has form when it comes to getting VA panels to achieve good response. Put simply, Samsung VA panels are the quickest. I'm going to say that, for my Cyber Monday bingo, I did not have two actually pretty damned good RTX 4070 gaming laptops on sale for less than $880. Okay, they're only a solid cent under that price, but still, that is an unprecedented pricetag for any gaming laptop sporting this GPU. The only issue with either machine is that they are sporting a single 512 GB SSD which is guaranteed to get filled with games as fast as you can download them. At the moment 1 TB is kinda the minimum we'd want as our boot drives, but both of these impressive budget machines come with spare M.2 slots in the back of them, making an SSD upgrade as easy as it could possibly be. If it's my money, I think I'd be more tempted by the HP machine with its more up-to-date AMD Ryzen CPU. That's a proper Zen 4 chip in there, rather than the slightly odd Zen 3.5+ offering in the Lenovo. But still, I really like the Lenovo chassis and keyboard, so it's still a bit of a toss-up. Both are going to perform well in games, that's for sure. HP Victus 16 | Ryzen 7 8845HS | RTX 4070 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 512 GB SSD | $1,399.99 $879.99 at Best Buy (save $520)This is easily the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop on the list right now, and the cheapest I think I've ever seen one on sale for. The RTX 4070 isn't a super low spec either, and seems to be a 115 W version. The only real concern I have is that the 512 GB SSD will get filled up fast, but there is a second SSD slot easily accessible in the back of the laptop, so is an easy upgrade. The screen isn't super bright, either, but at 300 nits it will be fine unless you're in a bright office or direct sunlight. Lenovo LOQ 15ARP9 | RTX 4070 | Ryzen 7 7435HS | 15.6-inch | 144 Hz | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $1,199.99 $879.99 at Walmart (save $320)This is the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've seen so far this Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Not only that, but it doesn't entirely suck in other ways. There's a reasonable amount of dual-channel memory and a speedy IPS screen. The 512 GB SSD does, however, suck, but you can easily upgrade it with the spare NVMe slot inside. Do you know what I'm obsessed with when it comes to gaming laptops? Inches. Namely 14 of the old imperial measurements. That's right, I frickin' love a 14-inch gaming laptop. Now, I am a man of a certain age, with fading eyes, but even then I think that size of laptop and laptop screen are the perfect scale for a genuine mobile gaming machine. The new 16-inch machines maybe aren't that much bigger, but for me they're still just getting on for that too big for travelling thing. A 14-incher, however, is much more easily used on plane's tray table, much better for balancing on your knees when you're sat on the floor in a crowded departure lounge, or even just to sit on a wee cafe table. And you can get serious performance in that slight form factor now, and there are some decent Cyber Monday 14-inch gaming laptop deals. The first thing to note is that there is absolutely a price premium for this smaller laptop form factor, so if that is absolutely your primary concern there are far cheaper RTX 4060-powered gaming laptops around. Because, yes, these machines are rather pricey in the context of RTX 4060 laptops, in fact you can find several RTX 4070 notebooks for less. But if you're after the form factor, these are the best 14-inch deals going. Omen Transcend 14 | RTX 4060 | Core Ultra 7 155H | 14-inch | 2880 x 1800 | OLED | 512 GB SSD | 16 GB RAM | $1,729.99 $1,129.99 at HP (save $600)This is a very specific type of laptop for a very specific type of person, but if you are that person, there's a good saving to be had. It's a teeny tiny little device with an RTX 4060 and one of Intel's Meteor Lake chips inside it. It has a more sleek chassis than most on this list, though that does come with a higher fee. It's basically RTX 4070 money for an RTX 4060. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 | RTX 4060 | Ryzen 9 8945HS | 16 GB LPDDR5X | 1 TB SSD | 1800p | OLED | 120 Hz | $1,599.99 $1,199.99 at Best Buy (save $400)You're really paying for the form factor here, as you might have noticed this laptop is surrounded by similarly price machines with RTX 4070s in them. Though the G14 is a wonderfully compact machine with a gorgeous OLED and all-metal chassis. It's a premium pick—there's a reason they're competing with Razer's Blade laptops—and the premium price can only be avoided so much. Still, $400 off isn't bad. Asus TUF A14 | RTX 4060 | Ryzen AI HX 370 | 14-inch | 16 GB RAM | 1 TB SSD | $1,499 $1,349 at Walmart (save $150)The TUF A14 was a bit of a surprise package to arrive in the PCG office this year, and I ended up a big fan in my review of it. It's a big upgrade on the previous generation of 14-inch, taking many of the design notes from the premium Zephyrus range, but doing so in a more affordable form. It's still a little pricey for an RTX 4060 laptop if that's all you're after, but for a compact 14-inch version with AMD's latest, even a small discount is decent. Keep it clean, people. You're desktop, I mean. I am, however, a man living in a glass house lobbing rocks about because if you were to glimpse my office space in PC Gamer Towers it would shock and disappoint you. It's gross. And I could probably do with at three of the five different PC cleaning goodies that our Jess has tracked down this Cyber Monday. SNACTIV PRO Finger Chopsticks | 4.21 inches | Glow in the dark | Dishwasher safe | $19.99 $15.79 at Amazon (save $4.20)If regular chopsticks require just a wee bit too much coordination for you—no judgment here—this tweezer tool that slips between your knuckles may be the perfect alternative utensil for eating your crumbly snack of choice. Tassmpitor Laptop and Keyboard Cleaning Kit | Cleaning brushes | Lens cleaner pen | Keycap puller | Refillable screen cleaning spray | $15.99 $12.27 at Amazon (save $3.72)Compact and portable, this cleaning kit has everything you need to keep your keyboard from getting crusty. With multiple, dainty little tools, there's nowhere to hide for dust, dirt, or crumbs. Compressed Air Duster & Mini Vacuum Keyboard Cleaner | Cordless | Range of detachable nozzles | $27.99 $21.99 at Newegg (same $6)This portable, handheld vacuum cleaner can do so much more than keep your keyboard free of crumbs. When sucking up dirt just won't suffice, the air vent on the back of the device lets you switch up your cleaning tactics. Colorcoral Universal Dust Cleaner Gel | Yellow | Lemon scent fragrance | No rinse necessary | Reusable | $11.99 $5.91 at Amazon (save $6.08)When a brush or vacuum just won't do, you'll need something that can take hold of the situation with an adhesive grip. Make no mistake, this will root out the toughest of dust bunnies from your hardware. VCOM RGB Gaming Headphones Stand | Black | 2 USB Type-A ports, 1 USB Type-C port | RGB lighting | 10 light modes | $21.99 $18.04 at Amazon (save $3.95)Tidy up your desk setup with this all-in-one stand. Stack your gaming headset, gamepads or other controllers, and more all on this snazzy rack with RGB lighting. There are still a ton of great Cyber Monday gaming PC deals alive out there. And our Andy has been running the rule over what's left and in his wisdom he's calling out these as the five best gaming PC deals still going strong today. CyberPowerPC Gamer Master | Ryzen 5 5500 | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR4 | 1 TB SSD | $879.99 $749.99 at Best Buy (save $130)This may be sporting a budget processor from a couple of AMD generations ago, but in combination with that RTX 4060 it should still be a mean lean machine for 1080p gaming—with even the odd dollop of 1440p thanks to DLSS 3. You're also getting a full 1 TB SSD and 16 GB of, admittedly DDR4, memory into the bargain. The AM4 platform may be old now, but it still has upgrade legs, and you could eventually stick a Ryzen 7 5700X3D in there to really beef up the gaming performance for not a lot of cash. Yeyian Tanto | Ryzen 5 7500F | RTX 4060 Ti | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,299 $949.99 at Newegg (save $350)This is the cheapest RTX 4060 Ti build around at the moment, and is actually a pretty decent rig. There are other options with low-end Core i5 chips, but this Zen 4 F-series CPU comes with six cores and 12 threads, and sits in an AM5 motherboard which gives it an upgrade path. The board is pretty low-spec however, so will likely only have space for the one SSD, but what you get is a full 1 TB. And that 16 GB of DDR5-5600 is pretty quick, too. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 14400F | RTX 4070 | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 1 TB SSD | $1,599 $1,149.99 at Newegg (save $350)RTX 4070 machines can vary in price and specification quite significantly, but here you're getting that great 1440p GPU (with even some 4K credentials thanks to DLSS 3), a nice and speedy Core i5 paired with a proper 32 GB dose of DDR5 RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. That's a really great selection of hardware that makes it a great gaming rig for more like budget prices. iBuyPower RDY Slate | Core i7 14700KF | RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with checkout code CYBERMONDAY)Yes, you can find slightly cheaper RTX 4070 Super builds right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this particular beastie. With this machine, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a particularly fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of fast RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. Yeyian Gaming PC | Core i7 13700F | RTX 4080 | 32 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $2,299.99 $1,999.99 at Newegg (save $300)While this is the old RTX 4080 and not the Super variant, it's got virtually identical performance, so this machine's still a mighty powerful rig for less than $2,000. The Core i7 CPU is a fine pairing for the GPU, and is backed up by 32 GB of relatively speedy DDR5 memory. The 1 TB SSD is the bare minimum amount of storage you'd expect to see at this price, but this is still an excellent gaming PC for the money. Look at it. JUST LOOK AT IT! Now, that's a controller. Seriously, this 8BitDo pad is outstanding. Not even just for the fact that it's only $25 right now in the Cyber Monday sales, but because of what you get in it. We're talking Hall effect sticks, so no more drift, AND Hall effect triggers, too. Normally we find it hard to look past the stock controllers from Microsoft and Sony for a pad recommendation; they're just so well built and genuinely affordable. But the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C has everything they do, and more. Our Jacob has been testing it recently for a review and has become rather enamoured with the controller. 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless | Mint | $29.99 $25.49 (save $4.50 at Amazon)We've already raved about Hall Effect joysticks and how they spell the end for the dreaded stick drift. In this wireless gaming controller, they're a welcome feature, as are the extra bumper buttons. Oh, and that's a seriously cheap price tag for a quality product, of course. Which is the main reason to pick one up: it feels very premium for the price. Just a good old fashioned great PC for a great price. There are cheaper RTX 4070 Super machines, but this one comes with a spec so well rounded that you will not be able to find a tangible flaw in this build. Normally we will complain about a miserly 1 TB of SSD storage space in a $1,400 gaming PC, but not here, because iBuyPower has jammed a full 2 TB drive in there. We won't complain about the memory so much, but we do expect at least 16 GB of RAM in our modern gaming PCs. Here iBuyPower has gone over and above again, with 32 GB of the good stuff in there. And I mean good stuff, too, because it's quick 6000 MT/s DDR5, which is just about the sweet spot for that Intel Core i7 CPU. It's a quality spec, for a quality machine. iBuyPower RDY Slate 8MP 002 | Core i7 14700KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with code CYBERMONDAY at checkout)Yes, you can find a cheaper RTX 4070 build right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this one. With this, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of speedy RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. The Lemokey G1 is an excellent, affordable wireless gaming mouse, now made even more affordable thanks to the Cyber Monday deals. It's accurate, lightweight, and feels good in the hand. In fact, I think I might prefer it to the DeathAdder V3 Pro which I use every day, and which now feels rather chunky in my soft gamer hands. With the Lemokey G1 at just $52 at Amazon you're getting a serious wireless gaming mouse for the money. With key specs, such as the 30K DPI, and 750 IPS tracking, it's a great mouse for gaming. Though I would ask you to ignore the 8K polling rate stuff; that's of dubious benefit at the best of times, and here it doesn't really work brilliantly and will just drain the battery more than is really necessary. Lemokey G1 | Wireless | 30,000 DPI | 55 g | $74.99 $52.49 at Amazon (save $22.50)Lemokey is better known for its gaming keyboards I'll wager, as the gaming subsidiary of Keychron, but it also makes great, affordable gaming mice, too. I recently reviewed the G1, and came away very impressed, even over the DeathAdder V3 Pro I use daily. The Lemokey is lighter and just feels more rapid. It's also a lot more affordable, espeically at this price. Just don't get too carried away with its promises of 8K polling—that just drains battery and performs a bit weirdly. Price check: Lemokey: $62.10 No rebate, no Prime members only shenanigans, just the cheapest price we've seen the Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti Super retailing for ever. Now, granted it's not a spectacular discount in real terms—while the MSI MSRP is down as $839.99, the standard MSRP was $799.99—this is still the most affordable the card has been. In the run up to the new GeForce generation dropping in January you might question spending even the $740 the MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super is going for on Amazon. That is a valid concern, and if you're happy with your current setup and reckon you'd fine waiting until at least the middle of 2025 to upgrade, then by all means wait and see what launches in that price bracket, and wait for it to come back into stock after the first flush of RTX 50-series GPUs get swallowed up. But if you're after a new graphics card today, and one that is pretty damned powerful but not too punitively priced, then the RTX 4070 Ti Super—dumb name and all—is a worthy purchase. MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super | 16 GB GDDR6X | 8,448 shaders | 2,655 MHz boost | $839.99 $739.99 at Amazon (save $100)The RTX 4070 Ti Super might be relatively new to the market, but we're still seeing some discounts on what is a very performant card. This model is very solid and comes with a triple fan cooler, and with the power of DLSS 3 makes for a mighty addition to any gaming rig. RTX 4070 Ti Super price check: Newegg $739.99 | Walmart $759.99 | Best Buy $799.99 Boo, the most affordable 4K OLED gaming monitor, that MSI one that was on sale for $700 over the past week, has lost its discount. Now that one is back up to $867 at Amazon. Nightmare. Well, not too much of a nightmare because the 240 Hz version of that MSI OLED, the MSI MAG 321UPX is still on sale for less, for $800 at Amazon. It sucks that it's $100 more than the Black Friday deal, but is still a great price for a 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor that was once around the $1,000 mark. In fact, most of the other 4K OLEDs using the same 32-inch panel are still retailing for over $1,000, so this still represents a good Cyber Monday gaming monitor deal. MSI MAG 321UPX | 32-inch | 4K | 240 Hz | QD-OLED | $799.99 at Amazon (save $100)With its special launch price of $949, the MSI MAG 321UPX was already by far the cheapest of the new generation of gorgeous high-pixel density 4K gaming OLEDs. But you can already get for $50 off. It makes most 27-inch 1440p OLEDs look painfully overpriced. It may be out of stock when you click through, but it's worth checking back for this great deal. Price check: Newegg $799.99 (sold out) Wireless gaming mice are grand, but largely a nice-to-have luxury. Wireless gaming keyboards are... well, IMO kinda pointless at best and a pain in the butt at worst. But wireless gaming headsets, that's a PC peripheral that I would say was made for low latency wireless protocols. Though it must be said a good wireless mouse is more affordable today than ever before. But I digress. The thing is, whether you think the cable on a mouse is unsightly, unless it's frustratingly stiff and gets in the way while you're playing it will have no material effect on the performance of the mouse. The same goes with keyboards, though it's actually even less useful as you keyboard, ideally, shouldn't be moving around as you type, negating any freedom-of-movement benefit from being wireless. But a wired gaming headset tethering your head to your PC is an abomination. Not only are you guaranteed at some point to stand up from desk while wearing your headset and either yank the cable out, bend the plug, or tip over your PC, but you will also hear that cable. You know that sound when the cable's rubbing against your clothes as you move your head around, and it translates into the ear cups strapped to your head? Yeah, you don't get any of that with a wireless headset. So, I'm firmly in the pro wireless headset corner, and this Cyber Monday there are deals on the good, better, best cable-free cans that we recommend as the best wireless gaming headsets. Corsair HS55 Wireless Core | 50 mm drivers | 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz | Closed-back | 2.4 GHz + Bluetooth | $99.99 $54.99 at Newegg (save $45)This is the Core version of our best budget wireless gaming headset, and it's on sale for a price that actually undercuts the wired version right now. The only difference with this Core version and the standard headset is that this one doesn't have iCUE support... which I don't think anyone outside of Corsair is going to miss. Price check: Amazon $54.99 HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless | 50 mm drivers | 15-21,000 Hz | Closed-back | Wireless | $199.99 $124.13 at Amazon (save $75.86)The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is one of our all-time favorite gaming headsets for many reasons, but there's a big headline feature to talk about here: 300-hour battery life. No, we didn't make a typo. 300 hours of gaming on a single charge, excellent DTS:X Spatial Audio, and premium comfort features make this headset an absolute stunner of a buy at this price. In fact, when we reviewed it the only major negative we could find was a slightly uninspiring microphone. Absolutely worth a serious look this one, at any level of discount. Price check: Walmart $125.99 | Newegg $144.99 Audeze Maxwell | 90mm planar magnetic drivers | 10 Hz to 50,000 Hz | Wireless | $299.99 $267.73 at Amazon (save $32.28)Well, here it is. The ultimate in wireless audiophile gaming headsets, the Audeze Maxwell makes use of a set of planar magnetic drivers to deliver audio quality that makes reviewers gush the world over. It's a bit heavy, and the software isn't great, but otherwise, this is a symphony of gaming headset luxury—as we found in our 93% review. Price check: Best Buy $299.99 From a pure price per gigabyte metric, these are the best-value SSDs around right now. Now, that doesn't mean they are the absolute best in their capacity class—there are faster drives for not a lot more cash in our regularly updated best Cyber Monday SSD deals page, such as the 1 TB Nextorage NEM-PAB which is up there with the fastest PCIe 4.0 drives, for just $68 at Newegg ($0.068 / GB). But on a pure costing basis, for the amount of storage space you get in return these three drives are the absolute lost price/GB SSDs on sale right now. Team Group MP44L | 1 TB | M.2 2280 | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,500 MB/s write | $79.99 $54.99 at Amazon (save $25)The MP44L is far from being the fastest SSD you can buy but for the money, you really can't complain. The read/write speeds are pretty low compared to others in our curated list, but they're still fast enough for most users and way better than a SATA SSD. If you avoid using it for heavy data transfers, you'll have no problems with it. Price check: Newegg $54.99 (out of stock) Silicon Power UD90 | 2 TB | NVMe | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,800 MB/s write | $97.97 $92.97 at Amazon (save $5)You might not know Silicon Power from Samsung, but this SSD is well-received by our friends at Tom's Hardware. It offers plenty of speed for a Steam library expansion but with a meager cost per gigabyte of just four cents. It's not the fastest SSD out there, though. Price check: Newegg $92.97 (out of stock) | $144.99 at B&H Photo (out of stock) Silicon Power UD90 | 4 TB | NVMe | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,500 MB/s write | $239.99 $189.97 at Amazon (save $50.02)This Silicon Power might not be the fastest of drives, but it's difficult to argue with this much storage for this sort of money. With a sequential read/write of 5,000 MB/s and 4,500 MB/s, it's still not what you'd call slow and should be fine for gaming; plus it comes from a reliable brand. You know what I love most in tech? A piece of kit that punches above its weight class, something that delivers build quality and great value. That's where I am with the Corsair TC100 Relaxed gaming chair. Is it the outright best place to park your butt when gaming? No, those are more expensive. But it is a really, really good chair. And what's more it's still retaining its Black Friday discount being just $180 at Best Buy. And Corsair. And B&H Photo. In fact, it's only not on Amazon because it had a run on the chairs and now it's out of stock, which is the second time in a week that it's gone out of stock at the retailer. Which is the best part of this particular deal. Not only is it a great product, and not only is it available at an unprecedentedly low price, but it's also available at that price in three separate locations, which gives me hope that anyone who wants one has a good chance of being able to buy one at this discounted price. Corsair TC100 | Fabric and leatherette | $249.99 $179.99 at Best Buy (save $70)The TC100 is our favorite affordable gaming chair right now, following up on the popular T3 Rush with a great look and genuine comfort. You can read more in our review. Right now, even with only a light discount, it's a truly excellent gaming chair that's cheaper than most of its competition. Price check: Corsair $179.99 | B&H Photo $179.99 | Amazon $179.99 (sold out) Okay, so it's not specifically a 'deal' but if you're at all interested in VR this is where the smart money goes. The Meta Quest 3S is the best-value gateway to virtual reality, being essentially an updated version of the classic Quest 2 for around the same money. Representing more of a step up, however, is the Quest 3, which ups the ante again for comfort and visuals. I think, even at its $500 price tag, it's a good price for the best VR headset around. So much so, that I bought one for my wonderful big brother's birthday; happy birthday, Rich! 🎁 I would absolutely recommend getting a new head strap, though, because the basic ones are pretty rubbish. Meta Quest 3S | 1832 x 1920 per eye | 72 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz | Inside-out tracking | $299 at AmazonIn our Meta Quest 3S review, we praise this little VR headset's great processor, price, and stable tracking. It is missing a 3.5 mm jack, comes with a lower base storage, and the screen is the same as the second-generation model (which is noticeably worse than the Quest 3) but these are the main places you will notice the over $200 price difference. If you order with the code 'QUEST100' at checkout on December 1, you'll also get a $100 digital credit for Amazon, which is pretty sweet, and the bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow and 3 months of Meta Quest+. Price check: Best Buy $299.99 (doesn't come with digital credit) Meta Quest 3 | 2064 x 2208 per eye | 72 Hz, 80 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz | Inside-out tracking | $499.99 at AmazonWith great tracking, a strong mobile chip, and dual LCD pancake lenses, the Meta Quest 3 is the strongest VR headset the company currently offers. Unfortunately, there is no Cyber Monday sale for it but it's already an impeccably well-valued headset, being the best VR headset for gaming right now. Though not a new offering, buying a Meta Quest 3 also gets you Batman: Arkham Shadow and 3 months of Meta Quest+, Meta's monthly game subscription service. Price check: Best Buy $499.99 There were some outstanding screens on offer over Black Friday, and I'm happy to report that three of our favorite OLED gaming monitors over that time are still on offer over the weekend. They all fill a spot in our Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals hub, and offer different displays for different kinds of gamer. But, crucially, they're all three OLED panels for under $900, which is testament to how the market has developed over the past year. There are two ultrawide monitors, one a 34-incher and the other ultrawiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide, at 49-inches. Then there is my personal favorite, the 32-inch 4K OLED from MSI for $700 at Amazon. That would be where my would go, because I love the 4K OLED I'm using at the moment, and I think it's a great panel. MSI MAG 341CQP | 34-inch | 3440 x 1440 | 175 Hz | QD-OLED | Curved | $779.99 $575.99 at Amazon (save $204)OLED gaming still isn't as affordable as we'd like. But it's getting there. This 34-inch ultrawide QD-OLED beast is still a good deal at this price, however. The 175 Hz refresh is a tiny bit pedestrian, but it's plenty fast enough for us and, in all other regards, this is the full OLED experience, including 0.03 ms response time and serious HDR sizzle. Price check: Newegg $599.99 MSI MAG 321UP | 32-inch | 4K | 165 Hz | QD-OLED | $829.99 $699.99 at Amazon (save $130)What a difference a letter makes... especially when it comes to gaming monitors. The code names given to monitors are often impenetrable, but the difference between this MAG 321UP and the MAG321UPX is that this one has a 165 Hz refresh instead of 240 Hz. That's the only difference between this and the more expensive one. If you're not concerned about the refresh rate difference (and do you have the hardware to hit a matching 240 fps otherwise?) then this is where the smart OLED money is spent. Price check: Newegg $699.99 Gigabyte Aorus CO49DQ | 49-inch | 5120 x 1440 | 144Hz | QD-OLED | Curved | $1,099.99 $899.99 at Amazon (save $200)It's not been around for long but the Aorus CO49DQ already has a decent discount, and it's a lot of monitor for the money as we found in our review. Those rocking the RTX 4090 might be better off with the higher refresh rate of the Samsung Odyssey G9 G93SC, but the rest of us can take advantage of this very wide, very pretty looking panel for a bit less.Price check: Best Buy $899.99 If you want to do a Bane and "go mobile" you could do a lot worse than the handheld gaming PCs still on offer as we come into Cyber Monday. Batman's Bane? Too obscure? Ah, I'm going to run with it. Two of the best gaming handhelds are rocking a hefty discount right now, with the LCD Steam Deck available for a stunningly cheap, almost Nintendo Switch-level price at $337 from Steam. There's also our top pick overall, the ROG Ally X, for $700 at Best Buy right now, and it's older sibling is $485 at Amazon. Those two handhelds essentially use the same APU, so will deliver similar performance, but the Ally X is the better of the two, with a better screen, better cooling, and a much bigger battery. But the old ROG Ally, with the Z1 Extreme chip, was still a good device... so long as you didn't use an SD card with it. They were prone to, erm, breaking. Just make sure you go for the one with the Z1 Extreme chip in it, not the straight Ryzen Z1 chip. That version of the Ally is also on sale for what looks like a good price, but the difference between the two chips is such that I wouldn't want the lower-spec Ally even at its deal price. I'd absolutely go with the Steam Deck over the Z1 Ally. Price watch:➖Steam Deck (LCD) | 512 GB SSD | SteamOS | $449 $336.75 at Steam (save $112.25)Okay, the Steam Deck may have had an OLED refresh and there are heaps of more powerful handhelds around, but the original version is still the archetype of what a mobile PC gaming device should be. It's just as powerful as the most recent model so all those Steam Deck compatible games should run well. It's the OG PC gaming handheld, and it still demands respect. At the very least because SteamOS is wicked and it's extremely affordable with this deal (which goes on until December 4 if you want more time to think). Price watch: 🔽Lenovo Legion Go | Z1 Extreme | 8.8-inch screen | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $699.99 $472.97 at Amazon (save $227.02)The Legion Go is one of the more polished handhelds on the market, with a sleek 8.8-inch screen and detachable controllers. That screen is a little overkill for the lil' AMD chip inside this machine, the Z1 Extreme also found in the ROG Ally, but it's great for playing indies on while relaxing. One of the controllers also becomes a mouse if you need it, which is a bit of a gimmick but works pretty well. Price check: Newegg $499.99 | Best Buy $549.99 Price watch: ➖ROG Ally | Z1 Extreme | 7-inch screen | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $589.99 $485 at Amazon (save $104.99)The original ROG Ally—still a strong performer even next to its improved sibling, the ROG Ally X. That's because they are both powered by the same Z1 Extreme chip from AMD. Considering the money off the original Ally, there's something to be said for choosing this over the X, though the bigger battery life on the X is definitely a huge improvement. Price check: Best Buy $499.99 Price watch: ➖ROG Ally X | Z1 Extreme | 7-inch screen | 24 GB RAM | 1 TB SSD | $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy (save $100)The ROG Ally X is a little bit too new to receive a massive discount. However, as our pick as the best handheld gaming PC to buy right now, even a $100 off is worth mentioning. Combining a generous helping of RAM, which really matters with an APU, alongside a 1 TB SSD and awesome form factor, the ROG Ally X is top of the charts for a reason. Price check: Asus $799.99 There are some deals I'm particularly happy about them having survived Black Friday and still being on offer over Cyber Monday and into Cyber Week. This being one of them. I love the Mountain Everest 60 keyboard, and I've played with every enthusiast keeb going, yet this is still the one I come back to. ☝️ That's me cradling my own Everest 60 looking tired because I am still live blogging deals. Over Black Friday it was $40 for Amazon Prime Members, but now it $40 at Amazon for everyone. So, everyone should buy one. Though the older TKL Everest board is also on offer for $40 at the Mountain store, and there's the full-fat Everest Max, with all the wrist rest, numpad, and controller extras included for $80, too. That was a nigh $300 kit when it launched, btw. Mountain Everest 60 | Mechanical | 60% | RGB | $69.99 $39.99 at Amazon (save $30)The Mountain Everest 60 is a perfect example of not having to spend a lot to get a cracking keyboard. Not only does it have hot-swappable switches and RGB, it's also wonderful to type on thanks to a plethora of enthusiast design choices such as great foam dampening, pre-lubed switches, and PBT keycaps. Oh, and you can snap on modular magnetic upgrades down the line, too, such a a numpad. This is the absolute cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've ever seen. The Lenovo LOQ range of laptops was always meant to be its more budget oriented line of gaming laptops, but they launched at a price that just didn't make sense considering their constraints. But we've seen some good discounts on them over Black Friday, and now this is probably my favorite Cyber Monday gaming laptop deal, and it's not even Monday yet. The miserly 512 GB SSD is pretty Scrooge-like, but aside from that the spec on offer here is outstanding for the money, and will make a fantastic gaming machine for someone. The RTX 4070 is a genuine 115 W version, so a very capable pixel pusher, and I've always been a big fan of Lenovo's laptop keyboards; they the best in the business. It's a win from me. Lenovo LOQ 15ARP9 | RTX 4070 | Ryzen 7 7435HS | 15.6-inch | 144 Hz | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $1,199.99 $879.99 at Walmart (save $320)This is the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've seen so far this Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Not only that, but it doesn't entirely suck in other ways. There's a reasonable amount of dual-channel memory and a speedy IPS screen. The 512 GB SSD does, however, suck, but you can easily upgrade it with the spare NVMe slot inside. iBuyPower is currently sitting pretty atop our guide to the best gaming PC you can buy right now, and it's also got a full suite of fantastic offers we've just dropped into our Cyber Monday gaming PC deals hub. We've had its rigs on this list for the super budget RTX 4060 machines over the Black Friday period, but here I want to highlight the more powerful, but still almost affordable gaming PCs it has on discount at the moment. Just don't forget the sneaky BLACKFRIDAY promo code for the big added discounts on the list price you'll see on the iBuyPower site. iBuyPower RDY Slate 8MP 002 | Core i7 14700KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Yes, you can find a cheaper RTX 4070 build right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this one. With this one, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of fast RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. iBuyPower RDY Y60 005 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $2,299 $1,599 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)This one's for those of you who expect to be doing some serious creative or productivity work alongside your gaming. That's because in addition to the RTX 4070 Super that's the heart of this PC's gaming chops, plus its 2 TB of storage and 32 GB of fast RAM, there's also a hefty 14900KF working as its brain. Make extra sure its BIOS is up to date, and then get churning through any CPU-heavy task you desire. iBuyPower RDY Lancool 005 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4080 Super| 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $2,799 $2,099 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Not only is this a great deal on an RTX 4080 Super build at not too far north of $2,000, but it's also an incredibly well-rounded one. We're talking 32 GB of snappy DDR5 RAM, 2 TB of storage (which is the ideal capacity for all but ultra-high-end or budget builds), and, most importantly, a 24-core i9 14900KF. Just make sure the PC's BIOS is up to date to prevent any Intel voltage funkiness. iBuyPower RDY Y70 TI B02 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4090 | 64 GB DDR5-6000 | 4 TB (2x2 TB) SSD | $3,999 $3,299 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Here we have something I can only describe as a behemoth, a mighty specimen whose name is overkill. 24-core CPU? Check. Most powerful graphics card on the market? Check. Double the RAM and storage of most expensive gaming PCs? Yep, check that, too. The only downside is this one doesn't come with the screen on the chassis that the Y70 04 above does. But that's a matter of preference anyway, I suppose. We have seen some cheaper RTX 4060-powered gaming PCs over Black Friday, but they're all out of stock right now. There are also cheaper options available right now, but none that have a spec that I'm as confident about as this Yeyian machine. It's another Yeyian Tanto gaming PC, for $750 at Newegg, but comes with the 10-core, 14-thread Core i5 13400F. I know there's been a lot made of Intel's troubles with the 13th and 14th Gen chips, but so long as you get your mobo's BIOS updated (as you should anyways) then there won't be any issue with this impressive budget machine. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 13400F | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,099 $749.99 at Newegg (save $349.01)This isn't the cheapest RTX 4060 gaming PC we've found this sales season, but this is the one that I'd be buying right now. While the other budget systems are similarly sporting last-gen CPUs, the Core i5 13400F is identical to the 14th Gen alternative, and faster than the Arrow Lake chips for gaming. Paired up with an RTX 4060 and 16 GB of relatively quick DDR5 memory makes this a great budget system. One of those new Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals I was talking about is actually the best-value RTX 4070 machine that I think I've ever seen. I've been working all hours over the past week, so my brain might be a little mushy at this point, but I don't remember seeing another RTX 4070 gaming laptop that I'd actually buy at this price point. The HP Victus 16 is just $930 at Best Buy today. Seriously. There's nothing really that sticks out as a big 🚩either. That RTX 4070 seems to be either a 115 or 120 W TGP, so should be pretty damned performant, and you're getting plenty speed 16 GB of DDR5 memory, too. Obviously that 512 GB is going to be an issue down the line, but the Victus 16 has a spare M.2 easily accessible under the rear casing, so you can just drop in a new 1 or 2 TB SSD as and when you need more space. Price watch: NEW DEAL!HP Victus 16 | Ryzen 7 8845HS | RTX 4070 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 512 GB SSD | $1,399.99 $929.99 at Best Buy (save $470)This is easily the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop on the list right now, and the cheapest I think I've ever seen one on sale for. The RTX 4070 isn't a super low spec either, and seems to be a 115 W version. The only real concern I have is that the 512 GB SSD will get filled up fast, but there is a second SSD slot easily accessible in the back of the laptop, so is an easy upgrade. The screen isn't super bright, either, but at 300 nits it will be fine unless you're in a bright office or direct sunlight. Right. Let's have it. One of the best Cyber Monday deals so far: These RTX 4070 gaming laptops are each under $900 The 5 best Cyber Monday gaming mouse deals you can still snag The best Xbox controller deal right now isn't at Amazon or Best Buy PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Cyber Monday is ticking towards a close, and Nintendo Switch deals have been flying judging by how many are running out of stock. A lot of the direct discounts on bundles have gone, but there are still some late savings about, including some great deals on Nintendo Switch games. - Quick links- Console deals- Game deals- Accessory deals- Live updates As often with Switch, many of the best deals are in the UK, where you can get a Switch Lite bundle with Animal Crossing: New Horizons and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online down from £199 to £189. You can also get a Switch OLED console alone for £229 at On Buy – super close to the lowest price I've seen. Keep checking our blog below for live updates on the latest Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch games, accessories and console deals as soon as we spot them. And for advice, see our Nintendo Switch vs Switch OLED piece. Most of the bundle deals we're seeing in the US right now are out of stock, but we're checking them regularly and will let you know if any re-appear. This bundle deal is one of the best we've seen this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, and while it's out of stock at both Target and Walmart, it keeps coming back every so often. The bundle includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe + 12 months of Switch online membership, which gets you access to hundreds of games from Nintendo's back catalogue. Price check: $349.99 at Amazon $299.99 at Amazon There's no direct cash saving here, but you get Mario Kart 8 Deluxe thrown in for the normal price of the standard Switch console alone. Price check: $299.99 at Nintendo Save £118.46: This is one of the best OLED deals I've seen as it includes one of Nintendo's best games - Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - and its Booster Course Pass worth £22.49, as well as 12 months subscription to Nintendo Online. Price check: Amazon £429.99 Save £10: This is only £10 off the usual retail price but that's better than nothing right now, considering that Switch deals are selling out pretty rapidly across the UK right now. Save £10 PLUS added value: We rarely see discounts on the Switch Lite model, so any deal no matter how small should be seen as a win. While this deal says it's only £10 off, there is actually plenty more value in this bundle. It includes a download code for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, one of the most popular Switch games played during lockdown, PLUS 12 months of Switch Online included. Save $10 PLUS added value: Again, this might not seem like a very big bundle discount initially, but there is extra value here that you may not notice. You get the Sports bundle + 12 months of Switch Online. A new console is usually £250 on its own, so these are just extra free perks. Save £70: This is a genuinely good deal, that's been running all week, but it's fluctuating quite a bit. Since our last update, the price has increased by £1, but this console deal remains a brilliant price (the lowest was £220 earlier in the week). Price check: Amazon £279 | Argos: £279.99 Save $20: Legend of Zelda is a game that unites the generations like no other, and Link is back in Tears of the Kingdom to defend Hyrule against malevolent forces with new abilities to explore. Target was beating this deal with $30 off on Black Friday. That deal's gone, but this is still one of the best discounts we've seen. Price Check: $52.99 (European version) at Amazon Best UK price: $44.99 at Amazon Save 64%: This is one of the best games on Nintendo Switch, and I scored it 5/5 in my Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review; for this price there's no excuse not to own one of the console's best Metroidvanias. Save $20: This is one of the most popular games right now across all platforms (not just the Nintendo Switch) and it's easy to see why. This new SEGA action-adventure title teams up old Sonic generations to defeat Dr. Eggman and Time Eater in a timeline-saving dash. My favourite is the Pinball challenge in the casino zone. Price Check: $29.99 at Best Buy | $30 at Walmart Save 49%: The successor to last year's mega-hit, FC 24, this new videogame instalment replaces what we all used to know as FIFA, and celebrates one of the world's biggest sports. It's almost half off, which makes it super tempting for football fans. Save $35: One of the most popular video game characters of all time, Sonic the Supersonic Hedgehog is back in this exhilarating adventure across the five Starfall Islands. Price Check: $31.99 at Best Buy | $39.99 at Target SAVE $30: Anime fans will love this one from Bandai Namco. Experience a new adventure as Luffy: search for the Straw Hats and get your crew back together while scouting mysterious islands and dungeons with a twist. The deal on the digital game. Price Check: $47.45 at Amazon Save 57%: Officially licensed for Nintendo Switch, this is a sweet deal on an unsexy but very useful SD card. It has dropped lower before (to $8.99 actually) but this still a marvellous price. Also available discounted at Best Buy in multiple storage sizes. Save 25%: The Turtle Beach Recon 50 is the best value headset for Nintendo Switch from this well-regarded brand. Perfect for online games of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. A lot of the games with the biggest discounts are ones from big TV and movie franchises like Star Wars (33% off the Heritage Pack), Sponge Bob (38% off the Patrick Star Game), Jurassic Park (25% off the Collection) and Transformers (38% off Galactic Trials). There are still Cyber Monday Switch game deals about. Amazon has a whole bunch of big discounts on Sonic games, including 40% off Sonic X Shadow Generations and 38% off Sonic Mania and Sonic Team Racing. Back over in the US, there's little left in terms of deals on consoles, I'm afraid. The best options are the Switch and Switch OLED bundle deals at Nintendo and Amazon. These aren't specifically Cyber Monday deals, but at least you get a game thrown in with the console. At this stage, it's very unlikely that any new deals will appear, so these are likely to be the best options for the rest of Cyber Monday, and even the rest of the year. There will be another window for deals after Christmas, but January sales haven't tended to bring up a lot of Switch discounts. This is another UK Switch OLED Bundle deal that i'd consider. It's not being billed as a Cyber Monday deal, but it's a great price when you consider that it's £10 cheaper than the RRP of the OLED console alone, and you get Super Mario Wonder and 12 months' of Nintendo Switch Online included. In the UK, Cyber Monday is very nearly over, so let's round up what's left at... Very. There are still a couple of bundle deals as well as savings on games. Here's my pick of the best. All of these are at Very, which has tended to be one of the best places for Switch bundle deals in the UK over the past few years. Some of these are specifically flagged as Black Friday deals, so I expect they will end at midnight. Direct savings on Switch consoles are few and far between now as Cyber Monday proceedings creep towards a close. I have noticed this small saving on the standard Switch in grey, though. It's not really a discount to shout about, but it's something at least if you want the console in that colour. Over in the UK, the best price on Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is £44.99 at Amazon and at Currys, a saving of £10. The best Nintendo Switch game deal of all Black Friday and Cyber Monday was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for just $39.99 at Target. That deal's now gone sadly, but the next best thing is a saving of $20 on the digital edition of the game at Best Buy. It's still one of the best deals we've seen on a title that continues to top our pick of the best Nintendo Switch games. It's across the US that we're seeing most sold out bundle deals. In the UK there are still some offers available. My favourite is this Nintendo Switch Lite Animal Crossing Bundle, which comes with a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, which gives you access to some fantastic classic games. Get the Switch Lite Animal Crossing bundle for £199 £189 at Argos Should you buy a deal right now if you see it? We'll be honest with you, yes. We've seen stock running out across various bundle deals so if you see something you like, we advise you to go for it. Hello there! Hi there deal hunters! It's Rosie Hilder here, logging on shortly before I finish my shift. I'm gonna have a quick look around to check if any more offers have appeared and I'll be back shortly with my findings. If you like your controllers separate from your Switch display, then another Joy-Con alternative to consider is the NYXI Hyperion Pro. I've personally reviewed this controller (or controllers should I say, since they come in a pair), and it functions exactly the same as official Nintendo Joy-Cons but with a chunkier design, and colour-changing LED lights for that neon gamer aesthetic that we all love. Take a look at my NYXI Hyperion Meteor and NYXI Hyperion Pro reviews for all of the details. Not a big fan of the official Joy-Con controllers that come with your Nintendo Switch? There are plenty of other (and much better) options out there for a more comfortable gaming experience. One of the most popular Joy-Con alternatives is the CRKD Nitro Deck, which is essentially a dock that your Nintendo Switch display slots into. It's classy in black, but also comes in other variants to give your console that retro aesthetic should you choose. The CRKD Nitro Deck is on sale this Cyber Monday for $69.99 $49.99 over at Amazon in the US, and for £37.49 at Amazon in the UK. If you're looking for a fun Nintendo Switch accessory this Cyber Monday, might I recommend this BMO Switch dock from Amazon? Modelled after the loveable Adventure Time character. I own this dock myself and I love it, but it's more of a stand really than a working dock, as there are no slots for connecting peripherals. In other words, it's an excellent stand for keeping your Switch sturdy while you play in tabletop mode, but it's no good for connecting your console to the TV. There are 3 colour options to choose from, Blue, Orange or Pink – and each option is reduced to only $16.73 for Cyber Monday, down from $24.98, saving you $8.25. There are Cyber Monday deals on some fun Nintendo-themed merchandise, including deals on Paladone gifts, collectibles and more. Take a look below at some of my favourite offers: The best Nintendo Switch games under $20, available now. Save 53% Was $39.99, now $18.74 The Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 features three of PlayStation's best games on Nintendo Switch. Plus this collection features the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear for NES, as well as documentary and other extras. Save 60% Was $49.99, now $19.99 The recently released Just Dance 2025 Edition – Limited Edition has never been priced this low before. This series has been hugely popular ever since release, and a great game to play with the kids on Christmas Day. This Limited Edition comes with cosmetic extras. Save 50% Was $39.99, now $19.99 Being a huge fan of The Karate Kid and retro games it's kind of hard not pass up on this on this deal. Game Mill's new pixel art brawler draws inspiration from classic games like Renegade and Double Dragon, as well as characters and scenes from the films (now a Netflix show). That last games round up was fun, let's see if I can find enough good Switch games under $10? What do you think? Is it possible? I did buy House of the Dead: Remake for $24.99 on Saturday, so maybe it's possible. Challenge accepted. The best Nintendo Switch games on sale for under $40 Getting or have a Nintendo Switch? Then below are my pick of the best games under $40 this Cyber Monday, including some classics, hidden gems and more. I've played these games, so they're recommended personally. (Including the GTA Trilogy that recently received an update that fixes its visuals, bugs and added new features like 'classic lighting mode'.) US readers - if you want a set of Turtle Beach headphones for Nintendo Switch then there are a couple of good dealsI can recommend. While Turtle Beach Recon 50 isn't on offer in the US, two other models are. I've set the deals out below. Turtle Beach make some of the best headsets for gaming, and the widely loved Turtle Beach Recon 50 is on sale for Cyber Monday. Unlike other brands, this affordable headset comes in the Nintendo Switch colours. If you don't want to spend too much on a gaming headset but want quality the Turtle Beach Recon 50 is a good buy. There's 35% off Turtle Beach Recon 50 at Amazon: £19.99 £13.99 Want the free Mario Christmas tree ornament from my previous post? Then I've found the best buys from the Nintendo Store that will take you just over the £70 fresh hold to earn your treat. Free gifts This game isn't on sale but if you buy it now on Cyber Monday it comes with some free Nintendo goodies, including Super Mario Party Jamboree themed Coaster Set, snack bowl and blanket. At £74.49 it just creeps above Nintendo's margin to earn the Mario ornament. The cutely named Alarmo is a clock like no other, it features a digital display that can be programmed to reflect your favourite Nintendo games, and includes Nintendo's unique fonts and 35 themed alarms. It also has sensors to note when you move and are awake. The collector's statue features Link from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and comes with a Sheikah Slate, Ancient Arrow and base that all feature LED functions. The statue us packaged in a collector's box. I just spied Nintendo's free gift! If you spend more than £70 on the Nintendo Store over Cyber Monday you get a free Mario holiday ornament to hang on the Christmas tree. Visit the Nintendo Store and claim your free ornament with orders over £90. The thing I love about Nintendo Switch is its handheld mode - and in all honesty, it's the way most of us play on the console. While I buy a lot of games over the eShop these days, it's still nice to have a collection of physical games, especially when travelling and access to WiFi can be limited. So below I've found the three best Nintendo Switch case deals available right now for Cyber Monday. Each has storage for the console, leads and game cards. Save 24% Was $19.91, now $15.19 at Amazon This case for Nintendo Switch features a protective hardshell outer case, with pockets for spare controllers, cables and a couple of cards. It's water-resistant and designed like an official Nintendo case. Save 40% Was $12.59, now $7.58 at Amazon Every Nintendo Switch owner needs a dedicated game card wallet, and this one from FYY is a good choice and has a whopping 40% off the retail price. It can store 24 game cards and 48 micro SD cards, so you never misplace a game. Save 25% Was $19.99, now $14.99 at Amazon Made from premium materials, including a ballistic outer hardshell case, this is fully licensed and tested by Nintendo for use with all Switch consoles. It even features a viewing stand and comes with extra game cases. This is the #1 selling Switch case in the USA and it's reduced for Cyber Monday. Get Nintendo SwitchSports + Super Mario Party Jamboree + Nintendo Online at Very, for £308.99 £289 (save £19.99). I literally bought the Nintendo Switch Sports bundle last year and now you can get it for less, with Super Mario Party Jamboree included and Nintendo Online added, too. So, of course I'd recommend this deal. If you have kids, nieces and nephews, or grandchildren this is a great bundle as both the included games are designed for the family and multiplayer. (And Nintendo Online offers access to hundreds of free retro games so oldies like me can settle in to a Metroid marathon on Boxing Day.) Hey, it's Ian here now, taking over from Georgia. I'm Creative Bloq's Editor, Digital Art and 3D and spend my time writing about all things, well… digital art and 3D, including game art, game design and reviewing Switch games.In a past life I was editor of Official PlayStation Magazine and have been writing about video games professionally since 1998, when Nintendo, Sony and Sega we're going head to head. But you're here for Nintendo Switch deals, and I'm going to find you some good ones, I promise. After yesterday's deals search I ended up buying House of the Dead Remake for my Switch, so let me just pause it and start the deals search. We're not seeing many Switch deals in the UK, but right now you can bag the Switch Lite for $185, a saving of $15. Which is better than nothing, right? Right? Rumours about the Nintendo Switch 2 have been hotting up for what feels like forever, but it's sounding like the souped-up Switch sequel might finally appear at the start of next year. For every rumour in one place, take a look at our main Nintendo Switch 2 page. You know what I think the best thing is about the Nintendo Switch? You can play Goldeneye on it. The 1997 N64 game has a special place in my heart, as I spent countless hours on it as a wee lad. For decades the only way to play it again was to dust off an old N64, but Goldeneye finally hit Nintendo Switch Online last year. And with that $50 off OLED deal at Walmart, you get 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online thrown in. One of the best deals we've seen this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend is $50 off the Nintendo Switch OLED bundle featuring Mario Kart 8 and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online. This deal is out of stock at Target, but Walmart has just brought it back, with the bundle down to $299. This one won't be hanging around for long. In previous years we might have suggested holding on before committing to buying a Switch OLED – but in 2024 things are different. With the Switch landscape about to change with the advent of the Nintendo Switch 2 (or is that Switch Pro?) – here's why. Animal Crossing arrived on the Switch at just the right time. With the world plunged into lockdown, this cosy universe offered a welcome break from those unprecedented times, with millions diving head-first into the game. It's still a delight, and right now in the UK, Argos is offering an Animal Crossing bundle with the Switch Lite and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online, down from £199 to £189. In the UK, Amazon is currently offering a renewed Nintendo Switch Lite for £149.99, down from the RRP of £199. Amazon's renewed models are almost as good as brand new. Amazon says these are "inspected, tested and cleaned in accordance with Amazon Renewed requirements to be fully functional." Good morning, Dan here taking over the Nintendo Switch live blog. But first, I'd like to wish a very happy Cyber Monday to all who celebrate. I certainly do – I'm wearing my Cyber Monday jumper and hat as we speak, and was made sure to wish everybody I passed on my commute to the office a friendly 'Cyber greetings'. Now, let's Switch (lol!) to the matter at hand. Since we left you, the Nintendo Switch deals landscape has changed, with old deals dying and new sprouting. I'll be bringing you all the latest info this morning, so keep your eyes peeled on this blog, and the deals information above. Okay gamers, It's just past 1am in the UK right now which means it's officially Cyber Monday! I'm signing off for the night, but stick with us (and this blog) first thing tomorrow to be kept in the loop about any fresh Nintendo Switch Cyber Monday deals as soon as we spot them. One of the worst things about owning a Nintendo Switch is the dreaded Joy-Con drift. I'm sure most Switch gamers have experienced this at some point, or if you haven't, then count yourself lucky. Stick drift is a very common issue where joysticks tend to shift out of place over time, so it's as if your character is moving on its own (or something else is happening on screen) that isn't your doing. There are plenty of newer controllers and joypads on the market that are now swapping out analogue sticks for what's known as hall effect joysticks instead, which promise absolutely zero stick drift. I've put together a guide of the best Joy-Con alternatives full of controllers that will work with your Nintendo Switch console, but never develop stick drift. Thank me later. What else can I tell you about the Nintendo Switch? Probably not much that you don't already know. Although, I did recently learn that you can use a Nintendo Switch with compatible AR Smart glasses. These are essentially wearable monitors that let you experience gameplay on a cinema-sized screen, which would be perfect for situations when you're without a screen or Nintendo Switch dock, like when travelling on a plane. If you're interested, I've rounded up some Cyber Monday deals on Smart Glasses that actually tempted me to buy a pair. Hi guys, it's Beth again 👋 Inspired by Georgia's post below about the Shadow the Hedgehog Lego set, I've found some super cool deals on Mega Blocks Pokémon sets over at Amazon that I think could make excellent stocking fillers for gamers 🎮 These Pokémon sets aren't officially Lego-branded, but instead are classed as MEGA Bloks which is a different brand owned by Mattel. I actually own two of these Pokémon Lego-alternative sets already, the Snorlax and Jumbo Pikachu sets, and they're really fun and challenging to build. You can find a few other options in a previous deals roundup I made a while back. Save 16% Was $58.99, now $49.50 at Amazon Save 38% Was $99.99, now $61.59 at Amazon Save $67 Was $171.99, now $104.99 at Amazon Of course you could always opt for a refurbished Switch if you wanted to save some extra pennies, and think about the environment, too. Most retailers have certified renewed models, often with warranties for a year or more. These are often returned devices that have been wiped clean and spruced up by a very capable tech team. You can even buy these direct from Nintendo and if that doesn't give you peace of mind, nothing will. Find renewed Nintendo Switch Lite consoles for $169, OLED from $319 and the standard Switch from $259.99. I just got stuck in a little hole of looking through the concepts people made back when the Switch 2 was going to be called the Switch Pro (in our heads anyway) and we had NO idea what it would be like, or when it was coming. We covered some of those concepts in news pieces. The first is a render made by Zone of Tech: We see what they did there. Kinda like a Lite but with zingier colours. And isn't this one delightful? I'd totally buy a purple Switch, though I know that's not the point at all. That screen looks like it's hiding some gorgeous graphics. I love how casually Nintendo announced the Switch 2. Just a little tweet, that's all it took to announce the biggest development in gaming handhelds, and one we were waiting for for years! Read all about the announcement here. Would I still recommend buying the Switch in the light of the news? Well, yes actually I would. But only the OLED and the Lite. I don't think there's a point in buying the standard console, unless you're on a very tight budget. Give it's eight years old I think you'd be better off spending a bit more to get the OLED Switch. And if I'm really honest I think they might discontinue that original one next year to realign the range. I remember back in 2021, an engineer made a GIANT Nintendo Switch. It was incredible. And that is how big the Switch looms in my brain after the whole weekend deal hunting. It was a fully working Switch that was 650% larger than a normal console! That means it was 70 inches wide and 30 inches tall... and it weighted an epic 29.5kg. It even had a 4K display. Pretty amazing if you wanted a cinema-like Nintendo Switch experience, eh? Read all about the giant Switch here. And watch the video below! There's also a really nice Mario Wonder OLED bundle deal at Argos if you're in the UK. You can get the OLED console plus the Super Mario Bros. Wonder game and that great Switch Online membership I've been banging on about for £289.99. There's a lot of added value here that could make it a viable alternative to that other UK deal from On Buy. If you're wanting a game to play, in fact hundreds of games, then this is the one for you. You'll only end up spending about that much on a similar amount of content if you go for a standalone console. I've just found a brilliant non-Switch deal I actually want to tell you about. We've recommended the sale price on the Sonic X Shadow Switch game above, but what about a Shadow the Hedgehog Lego set?! Target has got a stellar 30% off that set right now, saving you $21 and bringing it to $48.99. It's a really fun Shadow the Hedgehog head – and is the perfect gift for a Sonic fan (or yourself). You could build it then look admiringly at it while playing the associated game on your brand new Switch! There's a plan. Not totally sure how to use the Switch to its fullest capabilities? We've put together some handy tips and tricks for you to boost your gameplay. 12 pointers, in fact. From how to save battery life to customising your home screen, there are a bunch of useful ideas here for optimising your experience with the Switch. Find out our 12 tips for getting the most out of the Switch. If you've got this far you're likely to know which console you want. But if you're on the fence, or you're finding it hard to match your gaming priorities with your budget, then you'll want to read some stellar advice, I expect. For example, might it be worth dropping under the $200/£200 mark to get the Switch lite? If you're happy to keep your console in hand rather than play as a group through your TV then that might be a compromise you're willing to make. Are you happy with a slightly older, less flashy model? You could possibly be satisfied with the standard Switch console. Read 7 things to consider before buying a Switch here, and learn all about it. Hiya! It's Editor Georgia back again for an evening of deal hunting. I'm seeing so many standout deals sold out now, or returning to the usual price. This could mean an influx of new deals is set to drop – or it could be game over for Switch deals. In my experience, the kind of deal we saw this year (namely that $275 bundle deal that's now back to $349) will be limited. Not that I have much experience of that becuse normally there is very little to work with. But my guess it that that brilliant deal is over now because it would have been so popular! But I'll be happy to be wrong on this occasion. If tomorrow dawns and there are a whole host of new deals I'll be delighted to share them. It is worth noting that Amazon didn't take part in that big price slash. while Best Buy, Target AND Walmart did... Could the retail giant have something up its sleeve for tomorrow? If you're looking for some creative Nintendo stocking fillers in time for Christmas this year, we have a guide to the best Nintendo Stocking fillers for the gamers in your life. I really want the Lego Piranha Plant for my desk at home, and I think it would make an amazing gift for anyone wanting a unique office accessory (who needs a real houseplant when you have this?). There are tons of other options in the guide to suit a range of ages and budgets, so be sure to check it out if you need a gift to go along with your Nintendo Switch console purchase. One final accessory I'm recommending for any new Nintendo Switch owners is a case. If you don't already have one, then it's important to get a reliable case for your console to keep your Nintendo Switch display scratch-free, and keep out dust, plus you can also store your cartridges in most cases for safekeeping. The one I have is a leather Snorlax case which I bought on Amazon from a seller named PALPOW, but I think it's currently unavailable in the US and UK. Don't fret, here are five other Nintendo Switch cases that I would recommend below. • PowerA Protection Case • GeekShare Plush Protective Case • PALPOW Mario Switch Case • HORI Premium Vault Case • Tomtoc Switch Lite Case Need a dock for your Nintendo Switch? Cyber Monday is a great time to shop for Switch accessory deals, and we have a guide to the best Nintendo Switch docks to help you out. A docking station is one of the most essential Nintendo Switch accessories, and is compatible with both the standard Switch and Switch OLED models (but not the Switch Lite). I think it's fair to assume that plenty of you reading this will have experienced the dreaded Joy-Con drift (I know I have). If you're hoping to avoid that this Cyber Monday, then definitely take a look at the handy guide I put together on tried and tested Nintendo Switch Joy-Con alternatives that promise absolutely zero stick drift. The pair I own is the NYXI Hyperion Pro, and not only are these controllers gorgeous to look at with colour-changing LED but they operate in the exact same way as official Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons and even have motion controls too. Take a look at my NYXI Hyperion Pro review for all of the details. Keeping with the Pokémon theme, did you know that SanDisk has official Pokémon SD cards for the Nintendo Switch? There's a yellow Pikachu 256GB card, a Gengar 512GB card, and a Snorlax 1TB card which was on sale at Amazon for $134.99 $89.99 during Black Friday (I think this deal has sold out sadly) but you can get it dscounted at Amazon in the UK for £79.99 down from £127.99. My favourite game to play on my retro Nintendo 64 console is Pokémon Snap (maybe that's why I grew up to become a photographer 🤔), and this game was so popular back in the day that they remade it for the Nintendo Switch! The New Pokémon Snap (Nintendo Switch version) is on sale at Amazon right now for $59.99 $49.95, saving you $10 – and I highly recommend it if you love Pokémon games. You need to use your sharp eye to spot Pokémon in their natural habitat doing something interesting and snap a photo to earn a score. It's more fun than it sounds I promise. My first ever Nintendo console was the N64, which was passed onto me by my older brother when I was about 4 years old. I still have it today, and it sits proudly on my gaming shelf with a copy of Pokémon Stadium. I can't believe how expensive it is now to buy a Nintendo 64, although it is considered one of the best retro consoles ever. There are no Cyber Monday deals on the Nintendo 64 (obviously) but if you do fancy a hit of nostalgia you can pick one up for $110 at Amazon, or at Walmart for $114.95, which is actually a much better price than options I've been seeing on sites like eBay and Etsy. Hey gamers, Beth here! I thought I'd quickly introduce myself as I'll be taking over the blog for a while. I've owned my Nintendo Switch console since 2017, and I absolutely love it. I'm a huge Pokémon fan, but my favourite game to play right now is Disney Dreamlight Valley, as it's super chill and I love getting to unwind at the end of the day and complete tasks in my own Disney village. Beth is our Ecommerce Writer, and loves all things tech and gaming. She owns a PlayStation 5, Meta Quest 3, and Nintendo Switch, plus she used to work at a retail games store, so knows everything there is about the best Nintendo Switch prices and trade-in deals. Not to mention, she has a Snorlax tattoo, so if that doesn't scream Nintendo nerd we don't know what does. If you're looking for a Nintendo gift and a good deal, then the official Nintendo store is a good place to start. The online store features deals on games and Nintendo Switch consoles but it also sells branded gifts, accessories and merchandise. Below are some of my favourites: Balatro Special Edition is £24.99 £18.99 at Amazon, and I'm surprised. Balatro has been one of the year's more unusual games, but it's also one of the most awarded - and it's in the running to be crowned Game of the Year at the prestious The Game Awards held later this month. What is Balatro? It's an indie card game that mixes poker and and tactical card battling, and it's one of the most addictive games of 2024. When I started blogging about Nintendo Switch Cyber Monday deals today I really didn't expect Balatro to be on sale. The idea one of the biggest games of 2024 is reduced is, well… surprising. But then I did a little research, and it has been reduced before, but never to this low a price. The one thing better than finding a deal on a great Nintendo Switch game is finding a deal on a collector's edition. I rarely but collector's edition because they cost so much but on Cyber Monday you can often find a bargain. These special collector's editions include the game but also models, unique boxes and unique extras - they make great gifts. Below I've picked three of my favourite Nintendo Switch game collector's editions, some games are old but the bundles are good (and the best games remain classics and playable long after release - in fact some can be found on the best retro game consoles). Save 29% Was £84.99, now £59.99 at Amazon I grew up on the Turrican series, first playing it on Amiga, and while you can play it on AntStream Arcade, this collection for Nintendo Switch is a wonderful way to discover the classic shooters. This collector's edition features both Volume 1 and Volume 2, which includes every game released, plus an art book, documentary film, posters, stickers, soundtrack and more, all packaged in a designer box. Save 30% Was £49.99, now £34.99 at Amazon Spelunky HD os the remastered version of the breakout indie game that scooped numerous awards on release, and remains a fantastic game. It was originally made usinf GameMaker, the indie game engine. This collector's edition includes the Spelunky HD (which offers 3D or pixel art modes) as well as a specially designed box and art, with a figurine, level guide, soundtrack and more. The Spelunker HD Deluxe - Collector's Edition is limited to 1,300 editions. Save 5% Was £150.23, now £142.75 at Amazon The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom original soundtrack is one of the most popular and beautiful OSTs in gaming, and this collector's edition matches the music. It features 344 songs across nine CDs and comes with a collectible sword-shaped USB and it's all packaged into a striking designer box. Okay, it's not a game, but Zelda fans will adore this edition. Gifting online store IWOOT is a treasure trove of Nintendo goodies, present ideas and just weird rarities I never knew I wanted. There are small savings across the board on many of these collectibles, and it's well worth a look if you're struggling for a gift to buy the Ninty-fan in your life (or for you). The deals include £5 off Super Mario Monopoly £35.99 £30.99; it's the classic board game with added Mario. IWOOT also has Mario water bottles, Mushroom alarm clocks, Nintendo Christmas sweaters, Mario notebooks and mugs. I've just found some of the best Nintendo gifts on Etsy for any retro gamers reading this. A number of sellers have discounts on some eye-catching art prints, including Pop Art style illustrations of iconic Nintendo controllers. Below I've listed my favourites. If you're buying lots of games for Nintendo Switch then you'll need a good microSDXC card to store games and save data. There are some good deals on SanDisk cards for Switch, including Nintendo branded cards, this Cyber Monday, I've listed the best three below: Save 18% This is one of the best cards around, the SanDisk 512GB Extreme microSDXC card is now £42 £35 at Amazon, and it comes with a card reader too. There's also a deal on a two-pack bundle of 64GB SanDisk Extreme cards with a card read, now £28.98 £17.98 at Amazon. Save 15% This SanDisk card comes with Nintendo's branding, which means it's been tested by Nintendo to meet its high standards. This SanDisk 256GB card is now £21.99 £18.68 at Amazon. Save 17% This was £5 cheaper last Tuesday but it's rarely reduced below its RRP all year. This SanDisk card is another one tested and branded by Nintendo for Switch, and comes with the Animal Crossing leaf branding. This Animal Crossing SanDisk card is now £45.99 £37.99 at Amazon. I own a Switch original flavour, from way back, and even though it's brilliant and has saved me on some really dull flights (and post Christmas dinner slump) I'm toying with the idea of buying a Switch OLED today. I don't need a Switch OLED but it's a model the gamer in me wants - we're completists, right? We need the full collection. I've listed the best deal I'd buy / may buy… okay, will buy this Cyber Monday. This is coming home with me. Okay, I don't really want Super Mario Bros. Wonder but my nieces love Nintendo platformers, so I get my Switch OLED and they get a treat. The bundle costs £289.99 at Argos, and considering the OLED alone is £280 at Currys, this is a good deal. Add in a subscription to Nintendo Online, which as I shared earlier is really an entry into Nintendo's back catalogue of hundreds of retro games, deals, voucher offers and more, and this Argos deal is actually incredible value. One neat deals trick Nintendo Switch owners have long made use of that new owners need to know is the Nintendo Vouchers deal. Nintendo Online subscribers can buy two game vouchers for $99.98 / £84, to spend in the eShop on select games. The hack is games cost $59.99 / £49.99 so you're actually making a saving of around 25%. The best games in the voucher deal include: • Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition• The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom• Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door• Princess Peach: Showtime!• Pikmin 4 UK readers can buy vouchers here. It you're thinking of buying a Nintendo Switch in the Cyber Monday sales I'd urge you to sign-up for a Nintendo Online subscription. You can trial three months for free before signing up, but a subscription offers access to hundreds of classic games from Nintendo and Sega, including games released for SNES, Mega Drive, N64 and more. Nintendo regularly updates the list of retro games with new entries, such as Banjo-Tooie, and Sega has just added more to its collection. You can now even play classic game soundtracks with the Nintendo Music app (see below). Find out more on the Nintendo website. Even Nintendo Switch games that only just released can be found with small discounts for Cyber Monday. Below I've listed some eye-catching offers on brand new games, including the adorable The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and the Tomb Raider Remastered Trilogy, which I bought at launch and comes highly recommended (the final three games release 14 Feb next year in the Tomb Raider IV-V-VI Remastered bundle). To start things off, let's get personal. Not too personal, we don't know one another that well, but below I've found deals on three of my favourite Nintendo Switch games that I play regularly and come highly recommended. At full price these are great, with money off they're even better. Save $32 There's a massive 62% off one of my favourite games on Switch and one of the best Metroidvanias for the console, now just $17.97 at Amazon. Read my Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review. Save $20 Now $59.99 $39.99 at Best Buy. This charming tactical-puzzler in which you guide an army of adorable creatures over obstacles and battles is one of the most original series on Nintendo Switch. Save $20 Another reduced from $59.99 to $39.99 at Best Buy, and it remains one of the console's hidden gems. A platforming classic with a weird sense of humour, you'll love this. Hey deal hunters, it's Ian Dean here, Creative Bloq's Editor, Digital Arts & 3D, I'll be tracking down all the big offers and latest discounts for you on all Nintendo Switch consoles, games and fun stuff.I've been gaming since I could crawl and have been writing about games professionally since 1998, in a past life I sat opposite the Official Nintendo Magazine team has they argued over which Mario game is the best. As I sit here I literally have Metroid Prime Remastered on pause - my own personal Black Friday Switch treat. We're not 'switching' over to Cyber Monday deals, and there can often be some late offers on Nintendo games, accessories and collectibles as we head to the sales end. Stay with me, and we'll find some bargains. This morning has been a wild ride, my friends. I'm about to head off (apparently, I have a family and hobbies and shopping and clothes to wash who knew), but I wanted to alert you to a big Best Buy deal on my colleague Kimberly's favourite game: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Legend of Zelda is a big obsession for many of my friends, and if like Kimberly, you want to get all 1001 korok seeds, hurry up: she's up to 982. Wake up Demon Slayer fans! I have Cyber Monday goody news for you, because Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles for Switch is a big ol' $20 off on Amazon now, down to a equal-to-lowest-ever $39.99, from $59.99. It's overwhelmingly well reviewed, and looks gorgeous too, so get going before it's out of stock, my beautiful cherubs. Right, while I get some coffee and find the next deal to highlight, please enjoy this new Mario Kart theme from my current content-creator obsession, Carter Vail. Fret not, my American brethren, I haven't forgotten you. I have a sister in Denver, after all. For you, and just you, my beautiful, smart, funny and charming readers, I have found this lowest-ever price for the officially licensed PDP Switch controller. The wireless model is usually $54.99, but for Cyber Monday, it's been knocked down to $49.99, which is the lowest it's ever been. I've got the PDP controller for my PC (Xbox spec), and I absolutely love it. It works fantastically and looks beautiful too, so I have no doubt that the Switch one is as high-quality as that one. There's also a wide selection of colours, so you can find one to fit your interior decor to a tee. If, like me, you prefer a 'classic' controller rather than the Nintendo joy-cons, you're probably browsing for some nice Switch controller deals. And there's quite a few available. Perhaps the best-looking one is this Switch-themed controller from well-liked maker Cehensy, and it's a nice 20% off, down to only £17.58 (while it's still in stock, that is, controllers go out of stock real fast). I've used Cehensy controllers in the past, and based on the ones I've used, as well as customer reviews of this one, this controller is an excellent value deal. It's wireless too, which is always nice... I like games, let's find more games deals. The rather fantastic EA Sports FC 25 is almost half-price on Amazon UK right... now. We have played FC 24 to oblivion in this household and considering the reviews for the new'un, this might be the offer that compels me to get this one. My favourite feature in FC 24 was the Career mode, and that's carried over and further developed in FC 25, where you can develop your own superstar in the dog-eat-dog world of professional association football. Listen up, UK deal hunters. Finding big discounts on Switch consoles is always hard, but there is real value to be found in bundle deals. And I've found one I particularly like this morning (maybe it's because I'm trying to get fit so I've starting cycling at lunch and stuff), which puts the Switch Neon Red & Blue, Sports & Nintendo Switch Online 12 Month Membership all in one handy package for only £249 at Currys, down from £259. Seeing as the standalone unit costs £250 all on its lonesome, this constitutes A Good Deal if you ask me. I know Nintendo is the Realm of Mario, but I've always loved a bit of Sonic the Hedgehog, and right now, there's not one, not two, but THREE Cyber Monday deals on Sonic games at Amazon. So if you, and your 8-year-old son (like mine, incidentally), are both Sonic nutters, why save $20 off one Nintendo Switch Sonic game, when you can save a combined $41.25 on three of them? I haven't played Frontiers myself, but massively enjoyed Superstars and Sonic X Shadow Generations (my kid is a big Shadow fan), so these offers all get the thumbs up from us two experts. Morning, it's Tech Reviews Editor Erlingur here, I'll be escorting you through the magical kingdom of Nintendo Switch deals for the next couple of hours. As someone who has loved Nintendo ever since encountering Super Mario and Duck Hunt with my first NES wayyyyy back in 1989, I'm looking forward to this time with you. Usually, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are a frustrating hunting ground for Nintendo Switch deals (we've got a six-year track record of striving to find gems in the often-barren desert), but this year seems different, with lots and lots of great deals on consoles and games alike. And I've already spotted a verrrrry nice one... For UK Switch fans, we've been highlighting the same deal all week – this one that puts it at (currently) £228 at OnBuy. It's been changing in price a bit - the lowest we saw was £220 and it has gone up to £232 so don't be surprised to see it either sell out or get more expensive. If you'd prefer Amazon, you'll need to pay a bit extra - the OLED console is currently £274. Surprisingly for Amazon, there haven't been oodles of Switch deals on consoles. But the giant has had some great game deals, and accessories too which we will keep you posted on. WHO WILL WIN THE RACE for the lowest price? See what I did there with the Sonic image below? Great. Nintendo Switch OLED Model: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle: $349 $275 at Target So. What have we got? Well, we've got a fabulous bundle deal from Target, which sets the Switch OLED at a record-low price of $275 BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. That deal has $79 of added value in the form of Mario Kart Deluxe 8 and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online membership. So actually you're getting total savings of $144. What do you get with that membership? You get access to hundreds, yes hundreds of titles in Nintendo's back catalogue, plus some Sega titles too. I absolutely love retro games (the day they veered from platform gaming was a sad one for me, I don't have the spatial awareness) and so this is a real pull for me. If I was in the US I'd grab this deal immediately. It's in and out of stock at Target, and available in store only at best Buy. Get a taster of the game below: And we're off on yet ANOTHER Nintendo Switch live blog - our fifth year of blogging and my sixth of covering Nintendo Switch sales. I say this to let you know you're in the best possible hands here. We'll be sharing all our expert advice and insider knowledge on whether the deals you see are genuinely worth your time, and to let you know when to pull the trigger (press the mouse? trackpad? It's been a long weekend) on that deal you've been eyeing up. I'm really not exaggerating when I say that the Nintendo Switch deals we've seen this year have been the best I've ever seen during Black Friday. They're so good I was actually surprised. But they are going in and out of stock, so it's important to grab one where you can. Okay stand by and we'll get into this for real. Here's a picture of Mario as an elephant. Just because I can.

Title: Control the food, control the MAHA

The transition of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. from Democrat to independent to (gasp!) Republican was a popcorn-grabbing sideshow of the 2024 election season — until it became the main event. The defection of Bobby Kennedy to Team Trump was a seismic shift in an already bizarre presidential election, but it also formed a more perfect union — between MAGA and MAHA (Make America Healthy Again). And if President-Elect Donald Trump fails to deliver on his MAHA commitments, MAGA will collapse in the broken bargain. MAHA was not merely a clever pivot of campaign messaging; it was a melding of policy platforms necessary to reclaim Americans’ creed of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” MAGA is not about returning the nation to the 1950s; it is about restoring the Rule of Law, fiscal integrity, regulated borders, citizen security, and trust in the government. It is about reclaiming free speech and worship; equality of all, regardless of race or identity alphabet; and accountability for government agencies that lied about the Steele Dossier, Hunter Biden’s laptop, and the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 “interventions.” MAGA is about re-establishing basic constitutional liberties for all Americans. No MAGA, no MAHA. What good is liberty without health? The merging of the Kennedy platform with Trump’s offered Americans a dual vision — not just for economic growth and safer streets, but safer meals and a shift toward reducing illness, especially for children. Kennedy is correct about the health crisis unfolding in America. Who could possibly oppose MAHA? Democrats, for one. If Donald Trump advised taking daily vitamins, Democrats would likely dump their Geritol and Flintstones chewables into their toilets. However, another group is even more opposed to the MAHA plan: industrial agriculture and food processing interests. Politico reported on the battle over Trump’s choice for USDA that “some in the agriculture industry and on Capitol Hill ... [are] relieved the president-elect did not tap someone more openly aligned with Kennedy and his critiques of the current agriculture system.” The battle for USDA chief represents the battle for the soul of the nation’s future: [Kennedy has] openly promised to go to war with large agriculture interests he argues are at the root of Americans’ twin obesity and chronic health crises. But those fights lie within USDA, which oversees a $430 billion–plus yearly budget and 100,000 employees, touching nearly every part of the country’s $1.5 trillion food and agriculture industry. Not HHS. Farm state lawmakers on Capitol Hill have also been skeptical that Trump would actually allow Kennedy to follow through on his promises to upend the food system and go to war against big corporate agriculture interests, including those that are protected by rural Republicans. Several candidates for Cabinet posts even tried to lean on the strong ties to the corporate agriculture sector within Trump’s inner circle. A war on conventional agriculture is not in the cards even for Kennedy — the nation cannot transition away from its industrial food dependency as easily as Bobby did from toxic Democrats. However, if the industrial stranglehold on Americans’ food production and processing is not broken, the nation’s children, along with its water, soils, and food supplies, will continue to decline. There are trillions of dollars of federal subsidies involved in food production. The industrial “stakeholders” (not consumer “steakholders” or local farmers) are ultimately the beneficiaries of all those tax dollars. They will not allow Bobby to take away their cash cow without a fight. If Donald Trump does not deliver on promises to improve Americans’ health and food supplies, he will do more than merely break a political pledge — he will fall on the battlefield with banner in hand before even being sworn in. There is no life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness without healthy, local food supplies. Control the food, control the people — and their guns, worship times, political views, and ability to live. It is a tactic older than siege warfare. Stalin and Mao were mere dabblers compared to what the globalist cabal of the U.N., WHO, and WEF have in store for the global human population. Syngenta, Bayer, and BlackRock all sit as “partners” at the WEF table, crafting totalitarian plans to subjugate all food production under an industrial system that creates absolute dependency. Humans must eat plants and eliminate cows — but is that to save the world or to solidify corporate profits and globalist domination? These same companies, and many others, sit also in the corridors of the federal government, determined to retain their regulatory capture not just of the EPA and FDA, but of the pivotal USDA. Democrats claim they oppose corporate profiteers, but they have flung open the nation’s bureaucratic doors to corporate control — how about those PFAS being generated by renewables manufacturing? Forever chemicals for the little children, anyone? There is no persuasiveness for conservatives targeting renewables polluters if Big Ag is left in charge of food supplies. Control the food, control the people. Make the food healthier and more secure, and win We the People over for 2026 and 2028. Abandon food production to globalist profiteers, and all is lost. No MAHA, no MAGA. MAHA and MAGA go together. Free speech for cancer patients and obese children is not a life of liberty and pursuing happiness, but an irreversible dystopian doom. Kennedy has committed his entire being to thwart industrial domination of food. If Donald Trump does not heed Bobby’s warnings, the promises of MAGA will ring hollow as Americans’ health and life expectancies continue to plummet. Conservatives will lose all credibility with the electorate they promised to rescue from food enslavement, and they will sicken themselves and their children in the political process.

Title: ‘Every torch on the shore, every light at sea, represented someone who cared’ for teacher Máire Ní Fhatharta

Recovery of body gave family and friends space to grieve the loss of sea swimmer Máire Ní Fhátharta was described as 'kind' and 'dedicated' in tributes from family and her employer Volunteers at Silverstrand in Galway during the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta. Picture by Andy Newman. Máire Ní Fhatharta and her partner Dan King, who took a leading role in the search for her body Máire Ní Fhatharta, who died after going for a swim nearly three weeks ago Thick fog enveloped the northern shores of Galway Bay on the morning of November 12, and it never really lifted for the next 10 days. True, there were days of bright sunshine and falls of snow that transformed the Burren, along with icy winds that stung the skin. But over the second week of the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta, there was no talk of elections in Galway West — only a growing sense of apprehension as Storm Bert approached. The 32-year-old teacher would have known the bay’s vagaries, growing up close to its shores at Doire Locháin Thoir between na Forbacha and An Spidéal. Like musician Johnny Duhan, she was a morning sea swimmer. Silverstrand, a popular spot west of Salthill’s Blackrock, with a commanding view of Black Head, became busier for winter dippers during the Covid-19 pandemic. On that fateful morning nearly three weeks ago, the sea was calm and still below dense and freezing fog. For anyone there early, low tide at 7.42am required a walk out from the shoreline. Disorientation and hypothermia could have set in within minutes. The initial alarm was for Mr Duhan, who had not returned home. It was only when Ms Ní Fhatharta did not arrive at work that a second search ensued in the early afternoon, led by the Irish Coast Guard’s Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Valentia, Co Kerry, and Galway gardaí. By then, the 74-year-old songwriter’s body had been recovered on the incoming tide. However, the lingering fog precluded a helicopter search for the young woman. Galway Bay inshore lifeboat was launched and was quickly joined by kayakers, stand-up paddleboarders, inshore fishing and sea angling vessels, sailing club members and others with access to rigid inflatable boats (RIBs). Volunteers at Silverstrand in Galway during the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta. Picture by Andy Newman. Down at Silverstrand, gardaí set up a command structure where volunteers were encouraged to register. The Civil Defence joined in, as did Coast Guard units from Costelloe Bay, Cleggan and Killaloe, and drone searches were initiated by Cleggan and Doolin Coast Guard. Meanwhile, a WhatsApp group had been set up by friends and family, named “Bring Máire Home”, where volunteers were given regular updates on the location and time of shore team searches extending from Oranmore to An Cheathrú Rua. Family, including Ms Ní Fhatharta’s sisters, Fionnuala and Maighréad, moved into a camper van parked at Silverstrand, where friends joined them to help provide support. Onshore searches were co-ordinated from there by Ms Ní Fhatharta’s brother Tomas and brother-in-law Jack. Many who have had direct experience of the bay’s hazards were first to offer help, including Deirdre and Johnny Glynn. In August 2020, their daughter Ellen and her cousin Sara Feeney were rescued after over 15 hours at sea when their paddleboards were swept out from Na Forbacha beach by a northerly wind. She was the kindest, funniest, most special person I’ve ever known and probably will ever know ​As the Glynns and others discovered during their own long night of darkness, Galway Bay may be named Loch Lurgan, but it is a vast territory of over 300 square kilometres. The paddleboarders were rescued by Patrick and Morgan Oliver, but many families have not been so fortunate. During the early days of the search for Ms Ní Fhatharta, the body of a 45-year old woman from Cork, whose car had been found in Liscannor, Co Clare, was recovered from the water off the Aran island of Inis Oírr. Ms Ní Fhatharta had a lot to live for. She had taught in Scoil Iognaid and Gaeilscoil de hÍde, and had just started a new job in August as an Irish language planning officer with Fóram Cois Fharraige in An Spidéal. Her sisters painted a portrait of her in an interview with RTÉ Radio News at One. “Everyone who met her fell instantly in love with her, she was just something else,” Maighréad said. “She was the kindest, funniest, most special person I’ve ever known and probably will ever know. She was the best sister and friend, and partner to Dan, and we’re all very lucky to have known her.” Máire Ní Fhatharta and her partner Dan King, who took a leading role in the search for her body Describing her as a woman with a “wealth of skills”, Fóram Cois Fharraige said: “It was clear from that first day that she was a dedicated, serious, energetic woman, with a particular commitment to the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.” The shape of each day was framed by the checking of tide tables and the weather as family and work routines were amended or suspended. At night, and under a full moon during the first week, the beams of hundreds of torches became a regular feature on the many parts of the long, rocky, indented shoreline, stretching 45km from Oranmore to Indreabhán alone. Young friends and family, some of whom flew long distances to help, were assigned zones and team leaders. There were regular reminders that safety was paramount, but there were several minor incidents in challenging weather. Ms Ní Fhatharta’s partner, Dan King, knew how to co-ordinate the community element of the search at sea. An experienced sailor, he was previously a member of the Galway RNLI inshore lifeboat crew. He has windsurfed and stand-up paddleboarded at a high level for most of his life. In a cutting north-easterly wind, six layers of clothing could not keep the cold out in RIBs Search tracks were uploaded daily by boats and diving teams from Galway and Athlone and as far away as Mallow and Monaghan. There were also updates of the Marine Institute’s “Adrift” tool, which uses tidal, weather and river-flow data to provide a realistic simulation of missing persons at sea. By Sunday, November 17, the weather was more challenging, and by early that second week the forecast was for ice and snow. In a cutting north-easterly wind, six layers of clothing could not keep the cold out in RIBs. For kayakers and jet-skiers, it was a particularly arduous endurance test. “Our WhatsApp group for the on-land search was capped at 2,000 people and we frequently exceeded this cap,” said Mr King. “On water, we had over 60 vessels, 300 people per day ranging from commercial fishing vessels — from the Aran islands, Rossaveal and Clogherhead, Co Louth — to the Coast Guard, RNLI, Civil Defence, along with private boats, sub-aqua clubs, stand-up paddle boards, kayaks and swimmers.” Máire Ní Fhatharta, who died after going for a swim nearly three weeks ago In another cruel twist, there was a power cut in the early hours of Thursday, November 21, across much of south Connemara. The ESB network infrastructure had been badly damaged by snow. With the weekend storm approaching, word was that the state rescue agencies would have to stand down at some point. Those with experience of searches knew days seven to 10 would be key. ​That Thursday evening on WhatsApp, Mr King gave a rallying call to all the volunteers: “Let’s hope tomorrow is the day.” Across the city and county, quiet tears were shed And so it was. At around 4pm on Friday, November 22, just hours before Storm Bert, there was a sighting by the Rescue 115 helicopter near Silverstrand. A kayaker was asked to investigate. Ms Ní Fhatharta’s body was located, not far from where she had left for her swim. Across the city and county, quiet tears were shed. One volunteer who had been on many searches tried to articulate the feeling. “It’s the power of the collective at a time of wider bleak world events beyond our control, and it was so palpable,” they said. “Every torch on the shore, every light at sea, that represented someone who cares.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Nov 30 ends rare Meta Ray-Bans deal for $149 on Amazon

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable.

No false advertising here, just great deals on gear we trust—get the best deals on must-have products before they're gone. Everything on this list has been vetted, used, and loved by someone at WIRED. We've spent decades testing the products we recommend, and our Gear team has cross-checked our buying guides with the latest discounts to find the absolute best Cyber Monday deals.

WIRED's Cyber Monday 2024 Coverage Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata This Panasonic 4K Blu-Ray player supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, which makes it fully optimized for getting the most out of your discs. I like how simple and easy to use these players are, although they do have software that feels a bit like it was coded 20 years ago. Discs look way better than streaming content in most cases, so a solid deal on this player is a must if you’re looking to see your favorite content in the best possible quality. —Parker Hall Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar Apple’s latest iPad Pro tablet (6/10, WIRED Review) has several new features. It packs a bigger and brighter display, an upgraded OLED screen, and the front-facing camera has landscape mode. Under the hood is the latest M4 chip, which delivers snappy performance. It’s also compatible with a variety of new accessories including Magic Keyboard Case, Apple Pencil Pro, and Smart Folio case. However, we still recommend the 2022 M2-powered iPad Pro. It’s a great alternative if you want to save even more cash. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite iPad (7/10, WIRED Review) to recommend to most people. It’s powered by the A14 Bionic chip, which is the same one you’ll find in the iPhone 12, that never felt sluggish in our testing. It has a modernized design too, with slim bezels around a larger 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (IPS LCD) display, along with a USB-C port for charging, Touch ID in the power button, and a 12-megapixel selfie camera that’s been moved to the center of the iPad. It comes with support for the first-gen stylus or the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the Magic Keyboard Folio and the original Smart Folio case. —Brenda Stolyar Apple’s latest iPad Pro tablet (6/10, WIRED Review) has several new features. It packs a bigger and brighter display, an upgraded OLED screen, and the front-facing camera has landscape mode. Under the hood is the latest M4 chip, which delivers snappy performance. It’s also compatible with a variety of new accessories including Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro, and Smart Folio case. However, we still recommend the 2022 M2-powered iPad Pro. So, it’s a great alternative if you want to save even more cash. —Brenda Stolyar The first-generation Apple Pencil has been around for years now, but it’s still a solid option. It packs features like pressure sensitivity (the lines get thicker as you press harder on the display), tilt sensitivity (for shading), and handwriting support within apps and search fields. As for supported iPads, it works with the base model iPad (6th Gen and later), iPad Mini (5th Gen), the iPad Air (3rd Gen), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st and 2nd Gen), and iPad Pro 10.5-inch. It reaches this price often, but it’s still a good deal. —Brenda Stolyar The second-gen Apple Pencil packs a variety of features including pressure sensitivity, handwriting support, tilt sensitivity, and double-tap (which lets you switch quickly between tools by tapping the stylus twice). It has support for wireless pairing and wireless charging too, so you can magnetically connect it to the top edge of the iPad and it’ll automatically start charging. As for supported iPads, it works with the iPad Mini (6th gen), iPad Air (4th gen and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen and later), and the 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later). It's not compatible with the iPad Air (M2) or iPad Pro (M4) though. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar The Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a large 27-inch screen that’s great for getting work done. I’ve been using it alongside the M4-powered MacBook Pro daily. It doesn’t have HDR, which means colors look a bit more saturated and contrasty to the neutral tones you’ll find on Apple’s Pro Display XDR. But the 5K resolution is stunning and sharp. Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s a great monitor that comes complete with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers. —Brenda Stolyar This is the next step up from the MacBook Air with M3. It has three USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 (up from two on its predecessor) along with an SD card slot, HDMI port, high-impedance headphone jack, and MagSafe charging port. Apple also increased the memory on the base model from 8 gigabytes to 16 gigabytes. For an extra cost, you can add a nano-texture display too. You can also configure it with an M4 Pro or M4 Max for more power—both of which are also on sale. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar The M3-powered MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Macbook for most people. It has a nice 13.6-inch LCD screen and 1080p webcam while the M3 delivers a solid boost in performance compared to the M1 chip. It’s mainly great for everyday tasks but is certainly capable of handling a bit more like basic video editing or photo editing. Thanks to the M3, you can also use it with two external displays—the older chips only support a single display. —Brenda Stolyar Even though I have the M4-powered MacBook Pro at my disposal, I still reach for the 15-inch MacBook Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to use as my daily driver. It’s an excellent choice if you want a bigger screen without all the Pro features. It has the same modern build as the smaller model too, as well as a 1080p webcam and M3 chip. It works great for all my tasks, including word processing, video calls, sending emails, web browsing, and streaming content. For smoother performance, I suggest going for the 16 GB of unified memory. —Brenda Stolyar The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best option for ultimate power (7/10, WIRED Review). As with its predecessor, you’ll get a Mini-LED screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate, 1080p webcam, and a six-speaker sound system. This time around, Apple upgraded the USB ports with support for Thunderbolt 5 (120 Gbps/sec), giving you faster data transfer speeds. We tested the M4 Pro, which is a bit faster than last year’s M3 max chip, but it’s still capable of handling anything you throw at it. For even more power, you can pair it with the M4 Max. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar Having a proper ergonomic mouse can make a huge difference in your daily life, which is why we recommend the Logitech Lift for Mac, a vertically oriented mouse for Apple devices of all shapes and sizes. The vertical orientation puts your hand in a different position that some people may find more comfortable than a typical mouse, especially if you use your system for long periods at a time. It doesn’t cut where it counts though, with long battery life, a quiet magnetic scroll wheel, and a wide range of DPI settings to adjust to your liking. —Brad Bourque Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This excellent 3-in-1 charger for your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch is one of the best MagSafe chargers around. You can fold it away to a very compact size, making it an ideal travel companion. Charging for your iPhone goes up to 15 watts via a magnetic pad that can adjust to your preferred angle. There’s another pad for AirPods or other wireless earbuds, and a fold-out Apple Watch charger on the back. A 5-foot USB-C cable and wall adapter are included. —Simon Hill This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Magna-Tiles may be expensive (a little less expensive now), but the return on investment is just staggering. We bought our daughter’s first set when she was 2 or 3 and enjoyed making little 2D ice cream cones or hats. Now she’s 9 and can make full villages for stuffed animals in the course of an afternoon. There are also a ton of different themed sets (also on sale) if you need more specialized pieces for race courses or jungles. —Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So Any building toy is great for encouraging creativity and hand-eye coordination, and WIRED reviewer Simon Hill’s whole family found the Clixo sets to be irresistible. The pieces are durable, flexible, washable, and colorful, and you don’t need a flat surface to build so you can play with them anywhere. They also come in themed sets that have glow-in-the-dark pieces. —Adrienne So If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill Tacto is an app with physical pieces that convert your iPad, Android, or Fire tablet into a game board. With Tacto Chess, your kids can learn the basics, from how the pieces move to strategies for victory. The animated app features friendly voice acting and stories, chess puzzles to solve, a move predictor, and your child can play against AI or another person. My kids had some fun with this when they were learning, and it helped them understand chess a little better. This appears in our Best STEM Toys for Kids guide. —Simon Hill These markers are currently en route to my house to test for an upcoming gift guide update. They’ve gone exceedingly viral on TikTok and I can’t wait to get my hands on them. But generally, across the internet, they’ve got positive reviews. Each marker has a brush tip and a fineliner tip. You’ll get 120 colors, a swatch card, and a carrying case. Consider pairing them with a cozy coloring book (also en route to my house!) for hours of fun this winter. —Louryn Strampe I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is currently holding a sitewide Cyber Monday sale for 40 percent off. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals My quest to find the best portable chargers has led me to test hundreds of power banks, but this is my current favorite. I love the look of this transparent, prism-shaped device, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an IP66 rating for water resistance. It will fast charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. I have once seen it slightly cheaper, but this is a good price. —Simon Hill This is one of the best portable power stations for camping or road trips because it’s a manageable size. EcoFlow’s River 2 Pro has a LiFeP04 battery inside, which is good for 768 watt-hours. It has all the ports you need to charge your phones and other small gadgets, and the X-Boost surge enables it to power small appliances. You can charge it from an outlet or solar panels, though it takes more than an hour, and the fan can get a little noisy. —Simon Hill The Anker 737 is the upgrade pick in our best portable chargers guide. With a whopping 24,000 mAh capacity, support for power delivery 3.1, and the ability to send or receive up to 140 watts, this is the only power bank you need. It weighs nearly 1.4 pounds but is fairly compact, considering how much power it holds. A smart digital display shows battery percentage, and you can tap the power button to cycle through stats, including the temperature, total output, and more. This versatile portable charger fast-charged everything I tested and can easily juice up three devices at once. —Simon Hill Anker’s 657 charging station is an excellent charging station for those who charge a lot of devices simultaneously but also want to keep their floor and drawers tidy. It packs six electrical outlet plugs (three on each side) and two USB-C ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) that you can plug more cables into. But that’s not all. It also comes with two USB-C cables that support fast charging, which is great for your phone or laptop. It’s a great accessory to keep at the office, at home, or anywhere you use multiple gadgets at once. —Brenda Stolyar If you have multiple Apple gadgets, this T-shaped wireless charger makes it easy to charge them simultaneously. It suspends your iPhone (at 15-watt charging speed) and Apple Watch midair, while the rounded base charges your AirPods Pro or AirPods (with a wireless charging case). This version comes with Qi2 certification, which is the latest standard that enables faster, more efficient magnetic wireless charging. —Brenda Stolyar As a fan of the translucent electronics craze in the 1990s, I was immediately drawn to this power bank. You can see the ports, chips, and rechargeable Samsung Li-ion batteries inside. While an even better Shargeek (now Sharge) device replaced this in our best portable chargers guide, this power bank is still great. A color display shows the voltage, current, and power flowing in or out, and you can dig deeper for more stats. The DC barrel port lets you specify voltage and current for different devices, up to 75 watts, the first USB-C supports PD PPS up to 100 watts, the second offers 30 watts and supports PD 3.0 and Quick Charge 4 standards, and the USB-A port is QC 3.0 at up to 18 watts. —Simon Hill If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar We like Ugreen's 145-watt charger for its very fast charge times. It's compact for the power it provides, though it's not light at 1.1 pounds. You get two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw all 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W. —Scott Gilbertson This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar The first portable power station from DJI can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and has DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can charge phones, power microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with a lot of gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our Best Portable Power Stations guide. —Simon Hill The Qi2 wireless charging standard was developed in partnership with Apple and features MagSafe-like magnetic alignment and speedier iPhone charging rates of up to 15 watts. This power bank can also charge other Qi2 devices (when they appear) and existing Qi devices (just more slowly). This compact power bank also has a handy kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and an LED display that shows power and time to charge. You can attach MagSafe iPhones in portrait or landscape orientation, and it works with Apple’s StandBy mode, making it one of the Best MagSafe Power Banks. —Simon Hill Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill If your life goes well, you never have to use this thing and it just becomes some furniture for your trunk. But lord, what peace of mind if you leave your headlights on during a road trip through Wyoming. This model has saved the skin of a former WIRED reviewer on more than one occasion: a 1,000-amp, 12-volt battery pack with jump leads that’ll juice your battery in a bad situation. It also offers a USB-A port to charge your phone in a pinch, plus a built-in flashlight. This jump starter is often on sale below its list price of $130—but this is a good sale nonetheless. —Matthew Korfhage We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Mill food recycler just might be one of the most idiot-proof ways out there to dispatch food waste for those who don’t have access to municipal compost. Throw in food scraps (even meat!) and the Mill grinds and dries them into odorless, shelf-stable bits overnight. There’s a subscription program where you send the grounds off in the mail to be made into chicken feed, or you can use your grounds in the garden. We didn’t have the greatest success with that when we reviewed it earlier this year (6/10, WIRED Review), but we did find it to be a great device overall. —Kat Merck The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill Long ago, I used to think rice cookers were fundamentally the same. Then I bought my Zojirushi, with its fuzzy logic circuit that measures moisture and adjusts cooking time and temperature accordingly. Now all my rice tastes wonderful. This goes the same way with pilaf, congee, and coconut rice. This is among Zojirushi’s most basic models, but it has served me so well I’ve become a near-constant ambassador. And this is a terrific deal on it. —Matthew Korfhage The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell As seen in our guide to the Best White Elephant Gifts, this funny little tumbler holds both cereal and milk separately to be enjoyed on the go without the cereal becoming soggy. There is a learning curve—small, spherical cereal bits like Cheerios work best; you must block part of the milk hole with your lower lip lest the milk flow outpace the cereal flow; and the whole contraption tends to leak if the lid isn’t twisted on at exactly the right angle. However, it’s available in seven different colors and makes a great gag gift or stocking stuffer for someone who either loves cereal or never has time to eat breakfast. —Kat Merck Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty Cyber Monday discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane Breville’s Smart Oven Pro air fryer and toaster oven is a remarkably versatile device, even among the new generation of combo ovens we’ve tested. It’ll roast you a 14-pound turkey. It’ll make pounds of less-greasy french fries or wings. It bakes cookies. And it fares surprisingly well at not just reheating pizza, but also making it in the first place. —Matthew Korfhage These aprons from Hedley & Bennett are the sort you might expect to find in professional kitchens—sturdy and waxed, and able to withstand a significant spill without leaving you with a wet belly button. They make great gifts—especially the themed aprons ranging from cutesy bagel aprons to surprisingly thoughtful Star Wars aprons. The whole site is 20 percent off for Cyber Monday, and you'll see the discount once the apron is in your cart. —Matthew Korfhage This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe We like this budget-friendly food dehydrator and think it offers the best bang for your buck out of all the models we tested. The stackable BPA-free plastic rings are a little bulky and awkward to fit in the dishwasher, but everything we dehydrated dried evenly. If you don’t want to drop a ton of money on a food dehydrator, but you want one that works efficiently, this is a model worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe The Ninja Thirsti is a soda maker with a twist—a specialization in fruit-flavored sodas chockablock with caffeine and energizing B-vitamins and everything else that fills your day with pep. Flavors include watermelon lime, strawberry kiwi, lemonade, and dragonfruit. While we might like a SodaStream best for its ease of use, this device comes in at a low price even before the discount. —Matthew Korfhage This deal is on the subscribe and save option. We ranked 30 different energy drinks, and this one came in at No. 11. It’s got a nice little kick that levels off after about half an hour. WIRED contributor Pete Cottell says it’s a solid hangover aid. With 160 milligrams of caffeine and only 10 calories, this is a good option if you want something that tastes good and gently boosts you without making your heart feel the way dubstep sounds. —Louryn Strampe Milk comes from a cow. Or, in this case, an Almond Cow. From nuts and water, this specialized grinder and mixer makes enough delicious, frothy nut milk for a family’s worth of coffee, after just a few minutes of blending. The device will take some cleaning when you’re done, and it’s not very versatile. But it was the best device our testers tried for wringing milk from raw almonds, cashews, or oats. It’s a bit spendy in general, but this is the best deal we’ve seen on it. —Matthew Korfhage As condiments go, Chengdu-based Fly By Jing is a luxury—a pricy and cheffy take on classic chili crisp that’ll add chili zip, fried-onion crunch; numbing Sichuan pepper; and wildly savory umami to pretty much anything from ice cream to noodles. (If you already know you’re a Fly By Jing fan, check out the brand’s advent calendar.) This is the best time to stock up or procure a gift for your favorite chilihead, with 20 percent or more off pretty much everything they make. Personally, I stick to the classic chili crisp, in the “big boi” size that comports with the volume of chili crisp I actually apply to my food. —Matthew Korfhage How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage It’s officially soup season, and what better way to get into the spirit than with the Philips Soup Maker (7/10, WIRED Review)? This bad boy can make so much soup. Also chilis, stews, purées, and smoothies. It’s kind of like an Instant Pot, if an Instant Pot was specifically for liquids. Choose your preferred texture, from chunky to creamy and more, and the machine will heat (or cool), blend, and stir the added ingredients to perfection. The machine is quiet and purpose-built. If you’re a soup enthusiast, or aspiring to be one, this deal is a goodie. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill This is our favorite budget pick, but we only recommend it if it’s on sale—so we don’t suggest waiting too long to snag it. It’s pretty basic compared to the other cordless stick vacs in Dyson’s lineup. Instead of a power button, it still comes with a trigger (so you’ll have to hold it down while vacuuming), and it comes with accessories like a Motorbar cleaner head, combination tool, and crevice tool. It’s unfortunately not compatible with the Laser Slim Fluffy Cleaner head (which shoots out a green laser to easily spot microscopic dust). It’s also not as powerful as the others, with a 120,000 RPM but it’s plenty for picking up dust and debris. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So After reviewing literally hundreds of products, the Petlibro Granary Smart Camera Feeder sticks out in my mind as one of my most beloved items I’ve ever tested. This reliable, tech-savvy, and highly customizable automatic feeder is the future helicopter pet parents want. The feeder is controlled via an app with a schedule you create, and the best part is that it has a camera so that you can watch and hear your pet eat even when far away—and you can communicate with them via speaker. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Full disclosure: it’s unclear if you can buy spare parts for the S1 Pro anymore. That said, I’ve used it several times this year to groom my pup and it’s miles better than the old hair trimmer I had. There are loads of accessories you can attach to the vacuum-like hose, and it sucks all the hair, fur, and nail clippings into the little donut-shaped canister. It’s so much less messy. Read our Best Dog Accessories guide for more information. —Julian Chokkattu Every year, I remember WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu’s rave about Rothy’s shoes and ask myself if this is the year that I allow myself to be persuaded. From now until December 3, all shoes on Rothy’s site are 30 percent off. All of its shoes are made from plastic bottles (the driving loafers are made up of 21 bottles). They’re washable and recyclable—when you’ve worn them through, send them back to the company, where they’re disassembled and given new life. —Adrienne So Smart plugs are pretty darn cool. Anything becomes a smart device with their help—just plug in and bam—you can remote control it. The Kasa Smart Plug Mini is one of our favorite smart plugs since it’s nice and small, making it easy to use without blocking a neighboring outlet. Use the app to make routines and scenes like you would smart lights, so that your house comes to life for you, or to act like you're home when you aren't. Buy one on sale, or score an entire four-pack on sale and deck out the house. —Nena Farrell The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell Automatic curtains are a great way to wake in the morning with natural light and to keep the heat in or out if you live somewhere sunny. The trouble is they tend to be horribly expensive, but you can get retrofit solutions, like this third-generation SwitchBot device. It is easy to fit and works well if you have the right kind of drapes. In fact, this is our pick of the best retrofit options for automatic curtains in our best smart shades guide. Just keep in mind that you need two for a pair of curtains. —Simon Hill The Hatch Restore 2 has been trending for a reason. It's both a sunrise alarm clock and a fantastic sound machine, and it's beautiful to look at to boot. I think it's better as a sound machine than it is a sunrise alarm—it’s recommended as such in our guide to the Best Sunrise Alarm Clocks—since it doesn't get quite as bright as our other picks to force you to rise or to double as a bedside lamp, but it does do a lovely range of colors and would still work in a very dark room. It's a great bedside gadget, and now it's on sale. —Nena Farrell The Hatch Rest has been in my son's room since the day we brought him home. In a sea of tricky baby setup items—strollers! Bassinets! Infant car seats!—the Hatch Rest was the easiest setup by far, and that was with an infant in our arms while we got it working. It connects quickly to the app via Bluetooth and bam, you can set up sounds and soft lights for your baby (and maybe yourself) to fall asleep to. It's handy for older kids to use too, with light cues that can tell them if it's time to get out of bed. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell Yogasleep's Dohm sound machine is one of the most reliable sound machines you can buy. It's been around since 1962 and has been a pick in our guide to the Best Sound Machines for a while, too. It has just one sound: a fan, made by the built-in rotating fan. It's a classic, reliable choice if you aren't looking for a specific sound, but just a gentle background noise to help you sleep at night. It's got a nice little discount right now for Cyber Monday. —Nena Farrell Clocky is a robotlike alarm clock on wheels that falls from whatever surface you put it on and rolls away so that you’re forced out of bed to turn it off. The alarm itself is pleasantly comical—catapulting itself off a surface while the wheels spin backward and forward to move around the room (with a lot of beeping and whirring action). While I never really had to go far to chase the alarm, Clocky was the most efficient at getting me up out of all of the wacky extreme alarms I tested. If you’re a perpetual snoozer like me and have wanted to test out a nontraditional alarm, it’s a good time to snag one at a discounted price. —Molly Higgins This Roxicosly Super Loud vibrating alarm clock is one of the most reviewed nontraditional alarm clocks on Amazon. It’s semi-customizable, as the buzzer goes up to 106 decibels with a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, with the escalating pattern of the buzzing easing the snoozer into wakefulness—and the alarm “off” button doesn’t stick out, which minimizes the temptation to just turn off the alarm. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than a traditional alarm clock would, and at $17, it’s nearly the lowest we’ve ever seen it. —Molly Higgins This is a great little lamp that can transform the vibe of a room. All you have to do is plug it in and aim it toward the wall. It produces a halo-like effect with rainbow colors that make the space feel nice and cozy. (For a sunrise, check out our guide to the Best Sunrise Alarm Clocks.) It comes with a short cord though, so you’ll have to plug it into a power strip if you want it in a specific spot. I’d also make sure not to place it anywhere that someone can accidentally knock it over. —Brenda Stolyar OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So This handy little sunrise lamp is a smaller version of the Lumie Luxe 750FM, my favorite sunrise alarm clock that doubles as a bedside lamp. While a little smaller, the Lumie Shine 300 still gets plenty bright to wake up to or to use as a general light source at your bedside. The Shine is stylish on a bedside table, too, with its fabric base and sleek set of buttons. The only downside is that it only tells military time. —Nena Farrell In an air purifier market that can quickly ascend near four figures, the Shark is a solid purifier with easy setup, low maintenance, odor-neutralizer technology, no need for filter changes, and the ability to operate very close to the wall. The 650-square-foot model makes a great gift for college kids living in small spaces, or those just starting out—especially at a Black Friday discount that’s near the best we’ve seen for the device. An also-discounted upgrade will purify the air for twice the square footage. —Matthew Korfhage I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapiro Bosch came out with its Air line of Energy Star- and CARB-certified air purifiers this summer, including small, medium, and large versions. Look for this large version (covers 2,745 square feet!) in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers. I’ve been using it on the main floor of my house that has 23-foot ceilings, and the difference in smells, dust, and overall air quality has been extremely noticeable. It’s also imperceptibly quiet with the fan running on the lowest speed. The only downside is the expensive filters that must be replaced every six to nine months. —Kat Merck Homedics’ 4-in-1 cylinder design and demure footprint is able to exchange the air in a 350 square foot room almost five times an hour, in step with the CDC's AHC recommendation.. It’s CARB-certified as an electronic filter combining HEPA and an activated carbon filter for odors and VOCs, plus UV-C technology to reduce bacteria, mold, and fungus. Its built-in sensor and indicator light adjust the fan setting while giving an illuminated visual cue for air quality. It also comes with Homedics’ unique feature of an essential oil tray. Unlike air fresheners, Homedics’ essential oil tray doesn’t impact indoor air quality. One caveat: Essential oils are not always pet-safe. And while it isn’t app-compatible, it has a three-year warranty and is less expensive than other models in its class. —Lisa Wood Shapiro Air quality is an invisible thing that can nonetheless have huge effects on how you feel. Might as well know how it’s going, right? The QP Pro Air Quality Monitor is less visual than some and the print’s a bit small, so it sits best on your desk or bedside table. But for that, there’s a lot of information: particulates, temp, CO2, humidity, volatile compounds, outdoor air quality index, hoo-boy. And even without a discount, the device is already low-priced amid its flashier competition. —Matthew Korfhage It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell Our colleagues in the UK got a Savile Row tailor to assess popular T-shirts and pronounced this the best for dad bods. You can stock up right now with this discount. —Martin Cizmar Nixplay is a classic in the digital photo frame world with a great screen and beautiful frame, but like many other digital photo frames we love, it's not a cheap investment. Except for right now, where you can get the touchscreen 10-inch Nixplay for the same price as cheap, crappy frames you'll find on Amazon. It's comparable to our favorite Aura frames, but for an extra-cheap price point right now. Plus, Nixplay plants a tree for every frame purchased. —Nena Farrell This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our best outdoor security camera guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3X zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8X hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built-in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 FPS frame rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. —Simon Hill This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill What makes this one of the best indoor security cameras you can buy is the face recognition. It can warn you when there’s a stranger in your home and tell you when your kids or partner get in. With HDR, the 1080p video quality is crystal clear at 30 fps, and there’s automatic night vision when it’s dark. You also get decent two-way audio and enforced two-factor authentication, which is important for an indoor camera. The big downside is that you need a Nest Aware subscription costing $8 per month ($80/year) for 30 days of event video history and familiar face alerts, but that covers all your Nest devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar Folks who receive loads of packages will appreciate Eufy’s dual camera doorbell because it provides a view of your porch floor and front step, alongside the usual picture of whoever is calling. This is the best subscription-free option in our best video doorbells guide because there’s 8 GB of built-in storage for local recording, and it can connect to a HomeBase 3 hub for more. The 2K footage is crisp and clear, and there’s on-device people, package, and even face detection, though it’s not always accurate, and this doorbell can be laggy when connecting away from home. —Simon Hill As one of the best sleep trackers, the Withings Sleep Analyzer tracks your movements, breathing, and heart rate throughout the night, sending data to the Withings Health Mate app. Each morning, you can review your sleep phases, broken into awake, REM, light, and deep sleep, and get a sleep score out of 100 based on duration, depth, regularity, interruptions, time to fall asleep, and time to get up. This mat slips under your mattress, making it a great sleep-tracking option for folks who don’t like to wear watches or rings in bed. —Simon Hill A security camera kit is an easy way to get started with home security, and this Eufy one includes two cameras with a home hub. The upgrade pick for folks seeking a local, subscription-free system in our best outdoor security cameras guide, the EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a lot going for it. Solar is built-in for battery top-ups, video resolution goes all the way up to 4K, and there's 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pet, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces, though it’s not as good at it as Google’s Nest cams. —Simon Hill There are so many good-quality, affordable security cameras on the market, and the Blink Mini 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorites. It can record 1080p footage at up to 30 fps, offers decent low-light performance, and boasts on-device person detection. The catch is the subscription at $3 per month or $30 per year for a single camera, but it nets you a generous 60-day unlimited cloud video history. This camera is ideal for sitting unobtrusively on a shelf and keeping an eye on your home when you are away.—Simon Hill These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Buffy made a name for itself with its eucalyptus-based sheets and bedding—all of which are fantastic!—but I'm most in love with the brand's first cotton product, a set of percale sheets. Buffy's percale uses Supima cotton, which is a longer-staple cotton, making it extra soft while still retaining the crisp, breathable style of percale sheets. It's one of my favorite cooling sheets, and now a go-to for me even as a past percale hater. If you've been shopping for new percale sheets, snag these while they're on sale. —Nena Farrell Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale has been live for the past week, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good Cyber Monday get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe At under 8 pounds, the tabletop Levoit air purifier is perfect for compact spaces. And while it’s advertised to clean a 1,095-square-foot space, that’s only one air exchange an hour. For context, the CDC’s recommendation is five air exchanges an hour, putting the ideal room size for the Levoit at around 200 square feet. At just over a foot tall, the Levoit has a prefilter, activated carbon, and HEPA. The CARB-certified Levoit even offers a line of custom filters to suit specific needs: toxin absorber filter, smoke remover, and pet allergens. It has a user-friendly control panel and isn’t app-compatible, but it does have a two-year warranty. It also hums along at a quiet 24 dB and comes in white, gray, and black. And while I usually recommend fitting rooms with air purifiers that can clean the room—that means at least four air exchanges an hour at its quietest setting—sometimes a petite purifier is what’s needed for a home office or nursery. —Lisa Wood Shapiro Most people don't like linen because of how rough it is. If that's what's kept you away, then it's time to shop our favorite linen for those who want something extra soft: Cultiver's linen sheets. It's the only set of sheets I'd describe as borderline silky, a term I usually save for the likes of bamboo and actual silk. They're warmer than other sets of linen, making these a good choice for the upcoming winter months. It's not cheap to score such soft linen, so don't miss the chance to get these unbelievably soft linen sheets for 25 percent off. You can get some colors like Dusk and Cedar for even cheaper (though the top sheets are sold out for both colors, but you can choose to forgo those and just get the fitted sheet and pillowcases). —Nena Farrell Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor. Check out our guide for more great gifts for travelers. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Branch’s Ergonomic Chair is my first recommendation for anyone who just wants to upgrade their crappy old seat without spending a fortune. It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane The Plum Paper A5 Planner is a gorgeous, customizable planner that lets you add themed pages to complement your life. Whether you want pages for meal planning, fitness tracking, or to journal your baby's growth, Plum Paper has it all. Those baby-related add-ons are why it’s my paper planner pick for parents. (It will cost you extra to add these things on, but it’s around $5-$10 per add-on.) Plum Paper also has a ton of gorgeous sticker packs to order, from seasonal to fitness or baby themes. You can get custom stickers, too, which is fun. It's a great planner if you want something truly specific to your life—my copy has a section just for my son!—and you can get your own for 30 percent off right now. —Nena Farrell We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount for Cyber Monday. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque Topping our best routers guide, this affordable router combines a slick design with reliable performance. It’s only a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) router, but should be fast enough for most folks and will cover an average-sized home with an internet connection of 1 Gbps or less. Ample connectivity includes four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. The setup is simple, TP-Link’s Tether app is easy to use, and basic security and features like QoS (Quality of Service) are included. —Simon Hill We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill This TP-Link mesh will cover your whole home on a limited budget (it’s the budget pick in our best mesh routers guide). It is a Wi-Fi 6 dual-band mesh (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) that’s easy to set up. It’s not the speediest mesh, but it is fast enough for folks with internet connections of 500 Mbps or less. The vaselike design blends in easily on shelves or tables, and each router sports two gigabit Ethernet ports. For more than basic security and parental controls, you need Security+ at $5 a month or $36 a year, and Advanced Parental Controls at $3 a month or $18 a year). But, even with the subscriptions, the X20 is an affordable way to get reliable Wi-Fi. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane Anyone looking for an upgraded power supply should take a gander at the Corsair RM1000x. This full-size PSU can support up to 1,000 watts at 80 plus gold efficiency, which should be more than enough for most systems. It’s fully modular, for ease of installation and upgrading, or just for adding your own custom cables, and sports a 135-mm magnetic fan with a zero RPM mode for almost silent running. It’s not the biggest discount in the world, but enough to make it worth it for system builders who have waited patiently for prices to drop. —Brad Bourque The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill Simple to set up and use, Amazon's Eero mesh systems are easy to recommend and can act as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. It’s a great choice for busy households with many devices and a 1 Gbps or faster connection. Performance is excellent, but the 6-GHz band is short-range. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year) but includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Folks with smaller homes and connections up to 500 Mbps, should consider the Eero 6 (3-Pack) on sale at $150 ($50 off), but the more heavily discounted Eero 6+ (3-Pack) at $195 ($105 off) is a better deal if you can afford it. —Simon Hill If you want the top-of-the-line mesh system from Amazon’s Eero, it’s the Max 7. This tri-band system supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard. Each router can cover up to 2,500 square feet, and they have four Ethernet ports apiece, two rated at 10 Gbps and two at 2.5 Gbps. You can mix and match Eero routers, the app is very accessible, and this system is designed to be hands-off. It also boasts comprehensive smart home connectivity and the optional Eero Plus subscription is pricey ($10 per month or $100 per year) but bundles parental controls, enhanced security, ad blocking, a password manager, and VPN service. Eero has worked out some of the kinks since I tested the Max 7 (7/10, WIRED Review), but it’s still likely overkill for most folks and more than you need to spend unless you have a big busy household with a multi-gig internet connection. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu I love reading with my Kindle in bed, but my wrists hate it thanks to my wrist cysts. Luckily there's a gadget to fix that for me: the Lamicall Tablet Holder, which works for most tablets, Kindles, and even a Nintendo Switch. I use this arm clip version to clip the stand onto my nightstand or my bed frame, but it also works great on side tables next to my couch or any other sturdy frame. —Nena Farrell The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque As the most secure pick in our best USB flash drives guide, the Kingston IronKey is packed with security features. Run Kingston’s software to set up a password or passphrase, use the virtual keyboard to guard against keyloggers, and rest assured the contents will be automatically erased after 10 wrong attempts. It is FIPS Certified 197 and has 256-bit AES-XTS encryption, offers protection against brute-force attacks and BadUSB, and is manufactured in the US so is TAA compliant. In other words, this drive is as secure as they come. —Simon Hill It may not be the easiest to assemble, but the EN1 from FlexiSpot offers everything you need from a motorized standing desk at a reasonable price (especially with the Black Friday discount). The single motor can go from a height of 28 to 48 inches, and it doesn't wobble too much when fully extended. The desktop is made from environmentally friendly chipboard, but doesn't feel too cheap. You can also save three presets for quick switching to your preferred heights. If you work from home, a standing desk can really help you avoid sitting all day. —Simon Hill Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Do you think of a laptop as metal framing around a web browser? Consider a Chromebook. Google rolled out a big upgrade called Chromebook Plus in 2023. The “Plus” stands for better performance—faster processors, more memory, more storage, and better video cameras. Our favorite of the models we've tried is Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's among the fastest Chromebooks we've tested for the money. It features a 3.75-GHz Intel Core i3-1315U CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of flash storage. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson The Swift Go offers outstanding performance for the price (7/10, WIRED Review). It also boasts an impressive 15-hour battery life. The downside is the speakers, which aren't great, and overall the body feels a little plasticky. But this is the least expensive Intel Core Ultra laptop we've tested by a few dollars, so if the budget is tight, the Swift Go is worth considering. —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson The ReMarkable 2 is a great digital notebook—so great that it’s No. 1 in our Best Digital Notebooks guide. I find myself grabbing it daily to write down all kinds of things—grocery lists! To-do lists! Ideas for novels I'll never write!—or upload PDFs for me to read and edit. It's pricey, though, making this Cyber Monday sale super exciting. This on-sale bundle includes the Marker Plus, which has an eraser on the end for you to easily edit your notes without needing to switch between your tools on the page. Choose a bundle with the folio of your choice—I love the Type Folio for taking more detailed notes or mixing up my writing screen of the day, but the Book Folio has a better price—to get the sale price. —Nena Farrell Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Ray (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the oddest little soundbar in the Sonos lineup, but at this price, it’s a slam dunk for the right buyer. Unlike its siblings and nearly all modern offerings on our best soundbars list, the Ray doesn’t offer HDMI connection, using optical input instead. That means it won’t automatically work with your TV remote and it doesn’t even come with one of its own. That said, it can be programmed to work with most modern remotes. Alternatively, you can control it via the Sonos app, which unlocks tons of other features like Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay 2, and the ability to link up with other Sonos speakers as part of a whole-home system. Those are features soundbars at this price level almost never include. But the Ray’s best feature is its excellent sound, pumping out clear, musical, and surprisingly meaty audio for a bar proportioned more like a Bluetooth speaker. –Ryan Waniata This is the Bar 1300X (8/10, WIRED Recommends) deal I’ve been waiting for. If you’ve been after transformative Atmos immersion in a large-and-in-charge soundbar system, your time is now. The 1300X’s standout feature is its removable, battery-powered surrounds that can detach from the main bar as surround speakers when needed, or reattach, charge, and play as part of the larger bar. They’ll even work as standalone Bluetooth speakers. It’s a cool feature, but the 1300X’s Dolby Atmos performance is even cooler. You’ll feel like you're there when the up-firing speakers get rolling, putting you in a dome of sound. Music also sounds great, and the included subwoofer provides power and poise for everything you play. The app is a little lackluster for sound adjustments, but otherwise, I’ve got nothing but kudos for this uniquely versatile setup. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) come with a bunch of useful features including Conversation Awareness (which lowers your music and background noise when you're having a conversation), Adaptive Transparency mode (that combines noise cancellation and transparency to adjust audio), and support for Find My in case you lose them. They also have above-average sound quality, with excellent noise cancellation, crisp highs, and authoritative bass. —Brenda Stolyar The wait for the AirPods Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) with USB-C is finally over. Aside from the updated charging port, these are identical to the Lightning version (also on sale)—complete with great noise cancellation, a massive soundstage, and rich bass. They also pack great build quality, with a mesh headband and fabric earcups. The USB-C version also comes in a few new colors, including starlight, orange, purple, blue, and midnight. —Brenda Stolyar If you have an iPhone, the workout buds you need are still the Beats Fit Pro. (If it’s not broke, why fix it?) These everyday buds fit remarkably well, even in my tiny ears, with flexible fins. The H1 chip pairs seamlessly with all Apple products, and they sound great! I have gone running and accidentally put my head under a faucet while wearing these and they still work great. For more Apple-specific picks, check out our guide to the Best AirPods. —Adrienne So Ever since it was bought by Apple, Beats has been churning out some of the world’s most underrated earbuds. The Studio Buds + are no exception, with noise canceling, excellent integration with iPhones, and a more comfortable fit than you’ll get from AirPods Pro. They’re also better for workouts, thanks to built-in earfins that keep the IPX4-rated headphones in your ears. —Parker Hall After taking the Soundcore Life Q30 on a six-hour flight, I was perfectly pleased with the noise canceling they provide at a fraction of what you’ll pay for the best noise cancelers. They’re not going to give you the stunning tranquility of top names like Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, but they get the job done. Sound is warm yet detailed, and easy to adjust in the app, features are aplenty, and 40 hours of battery life per charge keeps away outlet apprehension. There are few telltale signs these aren’t premium cans in the build, including rather touchy plastic shells that tend to scratch easily. An included case helps there–and at this price, you can afford to treat them tough. —Ryan Waniata It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata I’m a big fan of Stax electrostatic headphones. These Bluetooth headphones are not that, but they retain some of the heritage, have solid sound, and offer all the audiophile specs you want. —Martin Cizmar Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20 this Cyber Monday. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These classic wired headphones have been in style since the moment they came out decades ago. The cool metal headband meets molded plastic earcups with vintage-style foam ear coverings, making these the best headphones ever to play with your CD or cassette player. —Parker Hall These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall Hearing damage is no joke, and it’s permanent. I’ve loved carrying these cheap earplugs from Earpeace on my keychain for when things get too loud, whether at a concert or elsewhere. They’re cheap, and they really do better with wide frequency ranges than the foam earplugs you’re probably most used to. If you always find yourself wishing you brought a pair, now is a good time to snag them. —Parker Hall These earplugs are a festival essential, and they’re always in my purse just in case I spontaneously decide to go to a show. I used to hate wearing earplugs (and I have the hearing damage to prove it). These have soft silicone outer shells that are barely noticeable, with pull tabs for easy adjustment and removal. The real magic is in the itty-bitty attenuator, which filters out the most damaging sounds on the high and low end of the spectrum without muffling the music. Even when the bass is rattling my bones for hours, I can wake up the next day without ringing ears. The included metal keychain case is convenient, too. —Louryn Strampe I prefer the Earpeace model above, but if you want to buy a couple of pairs of cheap earplugs to keep in your arsenal, Vibes makes a solid product too. I like how sleek they are in your ears; you don’t look like you’re wearing earplugs in front of the cool kids. The downside is that these can be a bit easier to lose—and harder to pull out—than other pairs. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe The Beats Studio Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) were solid headphones at full price, but after dropping a full $100 to around $250 on average, they became a lot more appealing. Now they’ve slipped even further, moving closer to the “gotta grab” category thanks to a mix of engaging sound and impressive usability. Extras include solid noise canceling, brilliant transparency mode, Apple-centric extras like “Hey, Siri” voice commands, and one-touch pairing for iPhone or Android devices. Their build isn’t as posh as premium models from Sony or Bose, but at a fraction of the price, they’re the better buy for tighter budgets. —Ryan Waniata Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata Soundcore’s Space A40 earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are getting older and probably not wiser, but they’re still a great pair of buds at bargain basement pricing. They offer decent noise canceling and transparency mode, lively sound with impressive stereo spacing, and a stylish design that makes them look a lot more pricey than they cost. You’ll find a fit that’s comfy enough for long listening sessions and plenty of the spoils in flagship buds at a fraction of the cost. Their one glaring omission is auto-pause sensors, and their touch sensors aren’t the most responsive, either. Those points aside, these buds are easy to love and even easier on your wallet. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Now is the time to procure the best face computer. The Ray-Ban Meta sunglasses are on sale across Meta, Ray-Ban, Best Buy, Target, and Amazon through December 2. I freaking love these things (possibly because I’ve been wearing Ray-Ban Wayfarers for almost two decades) and they’re so useful. You can listen to podcasts on your run! You can take pictures to text to your spouse! You can check if the food cart is open, all without taking out your phone. And as if that weren’t enough, they also shade your eyes. —Adrienne So Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Tribit’s Stormbox 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) was always on sale, even at full price. It costs as little as half what you’ll pay for rivals like the Ultimate Ears Boom 4, and at times comes surprisingly close in performance. Its tubular design puts out clear mids and solid bass from onboard passive radiators, while extras include up to 24 hours of battery life, long-range Bluetooth connection, a fully equipped app, and even a 3.5 mm analog input. You can get better sound by spending up, but this is among the best Bluetooth speakers you’ll find for the money. —Ryan Waniata Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata The Roam’s second coming includes a crucial update in the form of a simplified Bluetooth key, making it much easier to take the speaker off your local network and into the wild. This makes the Roam 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) an even better version of what is arguably the most versatile wireless speaker you can buy. Pack it in your bag, set it on the mantle, or drop it in the pool–the Roam abides (just don’t leave it in the pool). As with all things Sonos, the Roam’s wide array of streaming options and fantastic sound are its primary assets, while its utter packability makes it much more travel-friendly than Sonos’ other Bluetooth speaker, the Move. It all adds up to a killer sonic companion, wherever you may … well, you get it. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated this Cyber Monday. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Everyone needs a good pair of computer speakers, especially if you work from a home office. These desktop speakers from Audioengine have wired and Bluetooth connectivity, and they have front ports for better bass when placed against a wall or on a desktop. They’re not the newest model ever, but they’re still our favorite. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy, and the Everboom (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) is another solid option with a slightly inflated price. This sale brings it in line with more competitors. The Everboom has a few upgrades over siblings like the Megaboom 4, including slightly louder peak volume and extra bass, making it a mildly better choice for letting things fly at outdoor gatherings. It offers similar features elsewhere, including the ability to connect with up to 150 other UE speakers, a customizable EQ, and even a megaphone feature that lets you call through the speaker from the app. It's rugged, it’s weatherproof, and on sale, it’s a solid deal that’s worth adding to your arsenal. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata Sonos’ new app has made headlines for its troubles, but I’ve had the Era 300 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) on my network since it launched and never had an issue with it. The company seems to have mostly shored up its app issues elsewhere, letting the Era 300’s sound performance shine as it should. This Dolby Atmos-ready speaker can create a big and spacey soundstage with 3D audio tracks, and sounds fantastic with stereo music too, providing clear and intimate detail with deep bass. The speaker is loaded with features, including voice control via Alexa and Sonos’ built-in system, tons of streaming options, and the ability to connect with other Sonos speakers in a whole-home or surround sound configuration. That’s a lot of good stuff at an equally good sale price. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata The Era 100 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) was part of a full acoustic overhaul for Sonos’ smart speakers, and while the brand has had some trouble with its app of late, the Era 100’s performance has never been in doubt. This is simply the best-sounding smart speaker in its class, providing smooth and detailed mids, glistening treble, and much more bass than you’d expect from its tubular frame. It connects to your network in multiple configurations, working well as part of a multi-room audio system or a satellite for one of Sonos’ top-rated soundbars like the new Arc Ultra. Smarts are provided by both Alexa and Sonos’ built-in voice control system. The brand’s app revamp seems to have stabilized, and regardless, I’ve been using the Era 100 trouble-free since it launched in 2023. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar The Toniebox is the best kids speaker for younger kids. It’s a durable, squishy cube you can leave with your children unattended. When your kid places different “Tonies” on top of the cube, it plays songs and stories connected to the Tonies. It’s Wi-Fi-connected and you can also have grandparents or other family members record up to 90 minutes of reading to the kids or other audio messages. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale for Cyber Monday, but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage For the Aeropress lover in your life, even if it’s you: Swap out the cap on your Aeropress for a thicker Prismo, and you'll drastically increase the pressure you exert on the resulting brew. During testing, the WIRED team found this offered a cleaner cup, a bit of aeration, and an even more satisfying cold brew. Science! Though this Cyber Monday deal isn’t a whopper, it still matches the best discount we’ve seen this year. —Matthew Korfhage Here’s a gift for the premium coffee lover in your life: A vacuum container big enough for a coffee bag that’ll preserve flavor on fancy beans a lot longer. Just drop in the bag of coffee, then twist the handle on the pump to remove all air. The beans will await, perfectly in stasis. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage The Tally (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a scale for true coffee nerds. Sure, it weighs your coffee. It’ll also set a timer to track weight during a pour-over, for the true beanheads. Even more fun, the “Brew assist” mode will let you enter your desired coffee-to-water ratios and simul-calculate how much water you’ll need for the perfect brew as you weigh out your beans. Is this all a bit much? Sure—unless you’re a total nerd. Y’all know who you are. WIRED contributor Joe Ray loved the scale’s intuitive design. Like most Fellow coffee gear during Cyber Monday, the Tally is 20 percent off right now. —Matthew Korfhage The Secura French press is stainless steel, sturdy, and well-insulated. This last quality is what’s made it the WIRED Gear team’s favorite French press to make cold brew. But keeping hot coffee hot is also an excellent idea, and it’ll do that, too. —Matthew Korfhage This is the Wired Gear team’s favorite overall coffee bean grinder (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The Opus is a quiet device and offers a beautifully consistent grind all the way down to fine espresso settings. It also doesn’t break the bank compared to the highest-end grinders, which is even truer while it’s on sale. —Matthew Korfhage Need your espresso fix at the office, or a hotel room? This is the device we’d take. It’s the overall best portable espresso maker that the WIRED Gear team has tested: compact, lightweight and solid, with excellent extraction and surprisingly good crema. Just know you’ll have to apply some force on very fine grinds, a consideration for those with joint pain in their hands. —Matthew Korfhage Want better coffee? Get better coffee. The best way to upgrade your coffee is to make sure you're using fresh beans, and a coffee subscription service is the most reliable way to get a fresh bag at your doorstep. Atlas is our favorite single-origin roaster (for more on what that means, see our Best Coffee Subscriptions guide) and this deal gets your first bag of fresh beans delivered for free. —Scott Gilbertson Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s very easy to see why the Kindle Paperwhite is Amazon’s most popular model. The 12th-generation model (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a larger display (7 inches instead of 6.8), the highest contrast ratio on any Kindle (for sharp text and images), and three months of battery life (an increase from two months on its predecessor). It’s also the thinnest yet. We recommend it to anyone who is buying their very first Kindle. The Signature Edition is also on sale for $155, which comes with double the storage, auto-adjust brightness, and support for wireless charger. —Brenda Stolyar Even without the discount, the basic Kindle was already the most affordable option. And now, it’s under $100. The latest version is an iterative update compared to the 2022 model but it does come with a higher contrast ratio, a 25-percent-brighter front light at the highest setting, and a faster page-turn rate. It’s also the smallest Kindle, making it easy to hold one-handed and to travel with. It comes in a super fun matcha color, too. —Brenda Stolyar The latest kid-friendly Kindles received the same treatment as the rest of Amazon’s lineup—with a faster page-turn rate, a brighter screen, and a higher contrast ratio. This discount is for the basic model, which is small and compact. It also comes with a variety of kid-friendly covers to choose from. But the Paperwhite Kids is also on sale for $140 ($40 off). It comes with a larger display that’s better for reading graphic novels. Plus, it’s waterproof so you won’t have to worry about those accidental spills as much. Both models also come with six months of access to Kids+, Amazon’s subscription service for age-appropriate books, and a two-year warranty. —Brenda Stolyar We think Amazon’s Audible Premium Plus is the best audiobook service, as it bundles a library of Audible Originals, audiobooks, and podcasts, with one credit per month to use on any audiobook title you fancy, and regular exclusive deals and discounts. Usually, you get one month free, after which it costs $15 per month, but any nonsubscriber can get three months for $1 until the end of the year. Remember that you get to keep titles purchased with credits, even after your subscription ends. —Simon Hill Somehow it’s 2024 and most Kindles don’t have page-turning buttons. Forge your own future with this inexpensive little accessory. It comes with two pieces—one that you’ll attach to your Kindle, and one that you’ll hold in your hand. Simply click the button and your page will turn. The device is available in three different colors—black, pink, and white. You can also use it on your iPad or other device to turn pages on the Kindle app. Pair it with a gooseneck holder for the ultimate cozy reading sessions this winter. —Louryn Strampe Fire Tablets aren't great, but then again they're only $75 on sale—what do you want for that price? If all you plan to do is watch Amazon content and do basic tasks like email and browsing the web, they are reasonably capable and certainly affordable. The Fire HD 10 is our favorite of the bunch, with a 1080p screen and 3 gigabytes of RAM so it can handle watching videos and browsing with quite a few tabs open. —Scott Gilbertson The Fire HD 10 Kid's Edition is exactly the same as the regular above, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon's tablets are limited but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). —Scott Gilbertson The best value in the Fire tablet lineup, the HD 8 was updated earlier this year with more RAM (3GB) and a better 5-megapixel camera. It retains the same form factor, and battery life is still rated at 13 hours, although we rarely got over 11 in our testing. Storage options are either 32 GB or 64 GB, but I'd say stick with the cheaper of the two and add a microSD card (up to 1 TB, we like this Samsung card, also on sale for $27). —Scott Gilbertson The Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) is the most powerful tablet in the Fire lineup, almost like Amazon decided to make a real tablet. The problem is, despite being speedy and capable on the hardware side, it's still crippled by Amazon's subpar Fire OS. At full price we don't recommend this one, however, now that it's down to $140, it's a good deal. It's capable, much sleeker than the rest of the Fire tablets, and if you want to be more productive with it, the bundle with a keyboard is also on sale for $225 ($125 off). —Scott Gilbertson The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but it's on major sale for Cyber Monday. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20 this Cyber Monday. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Perhaps the best 4K streamer for folks who watch loads of Amazon Prime shows and movies, this Fire Stick is easy to set up and use, supports Wi-Fi 6E for fast and stable streaming, and packs 16 gigabytes of storage. Alexa is built into the remote to help you find content or ask questions about what you’re watching. The picture-in-picture mode is handy for showing security cameras or controlling other smart home devices. There's also “Ambient Experience,” which cycles through art or nature scenes on your TV when you’re not watching something. —Simon Hill Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The NuDerma Therapy Wand, now $59, is an affordable way to elevate your skincare routine for about less than half the cost of a single facial. Its neon-powered applicators stimulate circulation and oxygenate your skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and hydrated. Use it after applying your serums and creams to enhance their potency. —Boutayna Chokrane The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off for Cyber Monday, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Our favorite cheap electric toothbrush is even cheaper for Cyber Monday. You can usually find it for around $20, but it’s just $15 right now. It does a great job cleaning, has a gentle sonic cleaning style, and even comes with seven (that’s right, seven!) replacement heads. That’s not even $2 for the toothbrush and each head. It comes in pink, too. The only downside is that the charger is inconvenient, but for how much you get for the low price, it’s worth it. —Nena Farrell Yes, the TheraFace Mask is one of the pricier LED masks on the market, so if there’s ever a time to indulge, it’s during a sale. What sets it apart from other LED masks is the added vibration therapy, which massages pressure points around the eyes, browline, and scalp. Using it feels less like skincare and more like a therapeutic retreat I can experience from the comfort of my bed. —Boutayna Chokrane Why choose between skincare tools when you can have them all? With six interchangeable heads, the FDA-cleared TheraFace Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) offers an impressive range of facial treatments: cleansing, microcurrent, percussive massage, and LED light therapy (blue, red, and infrared). You don’t need to spend $400 for clear skin, but with $100 off, it’s a tempting treat for any beauty enthusiasts looking to pamper themselves at home. —Boutayna Chokrane The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage There are hair straighteners that are best for thick and curly hair and hair straighteners that are best for finer, more wavy hair, but it’s rare to find one that works great for both. As the top pick in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this ceramic iron makes short work of most hair textures—former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has one she’s been using on her curls since college, and this is the iron I use on my own unruly 3a curls for daily touch-ups. I also like the maneuverability of the smaller plates and the quick one-minute heating time. —Kat Merck This is not the exact model of hair straightener former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano tested in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, but it is a more affordable version of the Prima3100, and many hair professionals swear by BaByliss as a brand. I myself have had a BaByliss Pro hair dryer for more than 10 years and it still works as well as the day I bought it. I also love titanium-plate hair straighteners for their higher temperature maximums (450 degrees Fahrenheit) and even heat distribution, so I wouldn’t hesitate to give this one a try while it’s 20 bucks off. —Kat Merck If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck This is the best curling iron for long hair. It’s suitable for all hair types and has a tourmaline ceramic-coated barrel that’ll help your hair stay silky and frizz-free. The curling iron heats up quickly, and the long barrel means you have plenty of room to work so you won’t have to contort around trying to perfect your styling technique. This model also has dual voltage, so it’ll work on any international trips. —Louryn Strampe Deemed the best curling iron for long-lasting curls in our guide to the Best Curling Irons, WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary loved the elongated barrel of this iron, as well as the metal clamp to hold a curl in place while it sets. GHD is a quality brand that also makes some of our favorite hair straighteners as well, like the Chronos and Platinum+. Kilkeary wasn’t a huge fan of the lack of temperature dial on this curling iron, but she still recommends it as a durable option that produces long-lasting results. —Kat Merck Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano declared this uniquely shaped hair dryer as “made for curls” in our guide to the Best Hair Dryers. Basically a diffuser and dryer in one, it’s designed to dry curls gently while cutting down on frizz and puffiness. It doesn’t have a traditional handle, but that didn’t bother Medea. If you’re short on space in your bathroom and don’t want to have to store a hair dryer and separate diffuser attachment, this could be the solution for you. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe The MakeUp Eraser is a thing of beauty. The soft microfiber cloth is one of our favorite reusable products. It lives up to its name—simply get it wet with warm water and rub it gently over your face. It’ll demolish your makeup while being kinder to your skin than disposable makeup wipes. I’ve successfully used it to remove smoky eye looks, red liquid lipstick, and heavy contour—all in one fell swoop. You’ll still want to cleanse with a traditional cleanser or some micellar water, especially to remove traces from harder-to-reach areas like your inner corner or lashline, but this is an excellent and economical way to wash your face. The cloth is machine-washable and dries pretty quickly as well. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck A handle-free hair dryer may seem like a strange choice, but former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano thought this unique tool was not only comfortable to use, but made a great travel dryer due to its portability. Many online reviews mention that this is the dryer their hairdresser uses, which is not surprising given that Paul Mitchell also makes our favorite hair straightener. At this price, this would make a great gift for someone looking for a unique hair dryer that’s easy to store and pack. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's Cyber Monday sale. —Nena Farrell If you’re like me and spend endless hours glued to screens, you’re all too familiar with the toll it takes—eye strain, throbbing headaches, mental fatigue … SmartGoggles uses gentle heat, vibrations, and air compression to relieve the tension in your eyes and temples after a long day. Therabody recently released the 2.0, but the original model is equally impressive (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Our only gripe with the SmartGoggles is the price—until now. —Boutayna Chokrane With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage We only recommend three smart scales, and this is one of ’em. The Bluetooth scale displays weight on the LED screen, but if you want access to its other metrics—like muscle mass, visceral fat, and BMR measurements—you’ll need to use the Wyze smartphone app. Because of course, you will. But the scale can be used with up to eight individuals and there are modes for babies, pets, and luggage as well. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite Android phone is back at its lowest price!

Read our Best Pixel Phones guide to see all the fun little software tricks to take advantage of. —Julian Chokkattu This is the first major discount on Google’s brand-new Pixel smartphones, launched in late August (9/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re some of the smartest smartphones, with plenty of new features powered by Google’s Gemini large language models. For example, you can get instant transcriptions and summaries from voice recordings or phone calls. The XL version has the same features with a bigger display (and a bigger battery too). It costs $849 ($250 off). —Julian Chokkattu There are some quirks, but the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (6/10, WIRED Recommends) is the booklike folding phone I’d buy if I were in the market, and this is a tantalizing price. It’s very slim and using the external display feels like a normal phone, with nearly the same dimensions as the Pixel 9 Pro. But, of course, you can open the Fold up to reveal a much larger 8-inch internal screen, perfect for catching up on shows on the commute home. —Julian Chokkattu OK, brace yourselves, because the Galaxy S24 lineup now has four phones: Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the new Galaxy S24 FE (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The latter is the cheapest, taking some of the highlights from the flagship lineup and putting it in a more affordable body, lowering the price. At $475, it’s a great smartphone with long software support (seven years), even if it’s a bit drab. The S24 and S24+ won’t feel dramatically different, offering boosted specs here and there, but it’s the S24 Ultra for $950 ($350 off) you should consider if you’re after Samsung’s best. This one has the S Pen stylus built in, not to mention the 5X optical zoom, and the titanium build. Just know that Samsung is expected to debut a successor in January, so wait if you want the latest and greatest. This deal is also at Samsung and Best Buy. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu This 10-foot cable is long enough to allow you to place your phone where you want while charging (or continue using it without having to crouch near the outlet). It’s a durable braided nylon cable from Anker that comes with a lifetime warranty. It can deliver up to 100 watts to fast-charge any phone or tablet and comes with a handy cable tie. You can get it in black or white, but I like the red because it stands out, making it less of a tripping hazard. This is the best long cable in our best USB-C cables guide. —Simon Hill This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu OtterBox is usually my “Most Protective” recommendation in our many smartphone case guides. But the company makes all sorts of cases, even ones that are colorful, stylish, and slim. If you’re in the market for a new case, the company is offering 30 percent off sitewide on Amazon as well as its website. If you need a place to start, here are a few picks: Own a Pixel 9 series phone? I like the Commuter Series for $25 ($15 off). iPhone 16 owners should check out the protective OtterBox Defender Series Pro XT for $49 ($21 off). Anyone with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series should try the Commuter Series for $28 ($12 off). —Julian Chokkattu We like a variety of Case-Mate's phone cases and accessories. There's the Soap Bubble Magnetic Wallet, which is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MagSafe Wallets—it's secure, fits more than three cards (unlike most MagSafe wallets), and has a super cute aesthetic. We also like the glittery Karat Granite MagSafe Case for the iPhone 16, which adds a fun touch to this year's vibrant iPhone color options. —Brenda Stolyar If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The newest Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in two sizes, and I very much recommend you snag the larger 45-mm variant. It doesn’t look that big on small wrists, but you get much better battery life (just a smidge over a full 24 hours). Google’s health and fitness tracking capabilities are excellent, and there’s even a unique Loss of Pulse feature on the way in the US (it’s available in select countries), which could help contact emergency services in the event of cardiac arrest. —Julian Chokkattu The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The Withings’ line is consistently our top analog pick for both Best Smartwatches and Best Fitness Trackers. My colleague Simon Hill tested it and found that it’s comfortable, looks great, and has a long battery life and a comprehensive suite of health features that track heart rate and monitor your ECG. Two minor dings—Simon was unimpressed by the optional new subscription, and I found that the cycle tracking feature that comes with temperature tracking was not able to predict my period, but then again, no wrist-based wearable really can (so far). —Adrienne So Even though this deal isn’t shocking, I think more people should know about this amazingly cheap smartwatch (and it is a bit cheaper). CMF is the sub-brand of Nothing, which makes really affordable, retro-inspired gear that also has shockingly good value. This is the very rare, attractive sub-$100 smartwatch that also has accurate heart rate tracking and sleep. It has its own proprietary OS but works with iOS and Android. It also has a 10-day battery life and a very pretty AMOLED screen. —Adrienne So The Amazfit Balance (5/10, WIRED Recommends) is a decent smartwatch. Its sharp display, solid battery life, and fitness tracking is commendable at this price. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So says its AI-powered features don’t add much value, and the $15-per-month subscription can get taxing. Still, it’s a sleek watch with the basics covered, and the $60 discount makes it easier to forgive its flaws. —Boutayna Chokrane The Shock Clock 3 asks the question: What if a Fitbit was evil? This wearable wrist alarm I tested for my extreme alarm clocks guide vibrates, beeps, and zaps, with multiple strength settings and intervals to wake the snoozer. You can also opt for a silent alarm that wakes through touch, which is good for hard-of-hearing people or couples sharing a bed with different wakeup times. Be aware, though, the zaps at full strength can be quite painful and feel like a mild electric shock. If lowkey torture wasn’t enough, there are also advanced alarm options, like jumping jacks, so that you’re physically forced out of bed. This wearable alarm is good for chronic snoozers or those with partners, and the discounted price is a little closer to the actual value of this sometimes-glitchy device. —Molly Higgins Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a Cyber Monday deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100 for Cyber Monday, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse, or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale for Cyber Monday and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill If you’re hunting for an upgraded gaming headset with all the bells and whistles, the Arctis Nova Pro is our favorite pick for serious gamers. It includes a desktop DAC with convenient volume controls, real-time information, and EQ settings. Plus, it’s super comfortable for gaming long hours, with soft ear cups and an extra stretchy headband support that reduces strain on the top of your head. The wired version is on discount, but there’s a Wireless version as well (8/10, WIRED Recommends) if that’s more your speed. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount for Cyber Monday, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson The Backbone One (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the few products I’ve tried for work that I still reach for frequently, despite first reviewing it in 2020. In fact, I like this little mobile gaming controller so much that when I misplaced the review unit, I personally purchased my own. It’s compatible with iPhone and Android phones—just make sure to pick the right adapter when checking out. Plug it into your phone, stretch the controller over the back of your device, and prepare to be immersed. The buttons are tactile and have a superfast response time, and there’s a companion app that makes it easy to find new controller-supported mobile games, record your highlights, stream, and more. It also has pass-through charging and a headphone jack. My only gripe is that it’s a little awkward to tote around. —Louryn Strampe This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson If you’re building a new computer, you could do a lot worse than the Asus ROG Strix B550-F for your motherboard. This Ryzen-supporting motherboard is well-priced for its feature set, which is basic but sufficient. It only has PCIe 4.0 and DDR4 RAM, which means parts will be a bit cheaper and easier to come by, and 2.5 Gbps ethernet and USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports mean you still have modern connectivity. It’s not the biggest discount in the world, but every dollar counts when you’re building a new PC. —Brad Bourque Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through Cyber Monday (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger this Cyber Monday. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar After the holiday, reviewer Scott Gilbertson will be penning his ode to waxed canvas, the O.G. weatherproof material. In the meantime, we have his pick for the manliest jacket, which is the waxed canvas trucker you can see on Pedro Pascal in The Last of Us. It is the only jacket that will repel zombie blood from your flannel or hoodie, as you fight to save the ones you love.—Adrienne So Almost everything at Ooni is 20 percent off for Cyber Monday. While the Solo Stove may be the top pick in our Best Pizza Ovens roundup (temporarily! We don’t know for sure yet), we’ve tried and recommend pretty much everything from Ooni, which basically invented the category when the company launched in 2012. The Volt is its electric oven, which is the best pick if you’re staying inside right now. The specs are better than its closest competitor, the Breville Pizzaiolo, and I’ve made everything from cookies to roasted broccoli in mine. —Adrienne So I’ve put about 150 miles on this double-battery ebike, most of it full-throttle without pedaling. No, I didn’t do that all in one charge—the advertised 211 miles would be for a much lighter man pedaling much harder on a smoother surface than crushed limestone—but this bike handled well throughout. (After having it professionally tuned, that is—I’ve assembled and tested a half-dozen cheap ebikes and this one required the most attention from a professional bike mechanic out of the box.) For the Black Friday price of $1,250 you get a burly cargo bike with two big batteries and fast-charging if you’re looking to haul kids and groceries for long distances without dropping big bucks for one of our top electric cargo bike picks. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Ben Johns is the closest thing pickleball has to a household name, and his signature paddle from Joola is our pick for power players. This paddle has lots of pop if you’re looking to really launch ‘em. —Martin Cizmar This is WIRED editor Adrienne So's favorite running rain jacket. Even though it has a 10.2K waterproof rating, the fabric is still stretchy, soft, and breathable, while the cut is trim and tidy. WIRED editor Adrienne So says she wore it for several hours while running in the rain and water continued to bead up on the service without getting uncomfortably clammy underneath. If you get hot, you can open the mesh pockets to vent it. We also like that it comes in bright colors (for high visibility) and has reflective detailing. If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane I’m currently testing the Hikerkind Midlayer for our Gifts for Cold People guide. Hikerkind is designed for outdoorswomen who want technical clothing that fits correctly (sign me up!). The Midlayer doesn’t look overtly technical, but it uses the same recycled, synthetic Polartec Power Air as other high-end insulating midlayers. Honestly, it doesn’t keep me as warm as merino wool, but for highly aerobic activities, it’s drier (and prettier). —Adrienne So The top pick on our brand-new guide to the best flashlights, the Arkfeld Pro has a bright, 1300-lumen main beam but won us over with its two auxiliary lights, a laser for spotlighting stuff across distances, and a UV light that’s helpful in identifying leaks and stains. It’s rechargeable via a handy magnetic connection and the square shape keeps it from rolling weird places. —Martin Cizmar Not only is the Theragun Sense the quietest of all Theraguns, but it also packs the same premium features as the higher-end models. The built-in LCD screen and guided breathwork routines deliver the same luxe factor as the Pro Plus model for $400 less. The four included attachments (standard ball, dampener, thumb, and micro-point) cover all the muscle groups. —Boutayna Chokrane Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off) for Cyber Monday, it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re new to Theraguns or just need a straightforward recovery tool without blowing your whole paycheck, the Theragun Relief is an absolute steal—especially at $30 off. As the most affordable one, it omits the flashy features of the higher-end models, but it doesn’t skimp on performance. With three speed settings and three attachments (standard ball, dampener, and thumb), it still delivers everything one might need for muscle relief. —Boutayna Chokrane Don’t let the size of the Theragun Mini 2 fool you—though she be but little, she is fierce! With three attachments (standard ball, dampener, and thumb) and 150-minute battery life, the Mini 2 is the best for targeting sore spots on the go. It’s not the best for the harder-to-reach areas, but it excels in portability. I’ve been carrying it in my gym bag for months and hardly notice its presence. It even includes a zip-up case; one less pochette to buy. —Boutayna Chokrane You can buy standard foam rollers for way less, but the Therabody Wave Roller justifies its price with its tech-enhanced features. With five vibration frequencies, it allows you to target specific muscle groups with varying intensities. The added benefit of Bluetooth connectivity lets you pair it with the Therabody app for even more customized options. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The KQi3 Pro used to be my top recommendation, but it’s not the newest kid on the block and has been supplanted by the Niu KQi 300X (see below). I regularly managed around 15 miles of range at its 20-mph top speed. It’s 45 pounds, but because the stem is thin and latches into the deck, it’s not too hard to carry. This is a scooter you can use for short commutes in a city, even if it’s a couple of years old. The price has been creeping lower for the past two years but this is the lowest to date. You should also check out the KQi3 Max, which bumps the motor slightly for a smidge more power when climbing hills. It’s on sale for $599 ($150 off). —Julian Chokkattu Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So I’ve been testing this down puffer instead of my usual Patagonia puffer so far this winter and have been duly impressed by the perfect trim cuts of the recycled shell fabric, smooth zippers, and how light it is (less than a pound for my XL). —Martin Cizmar WIRED contributor Kristin Canning said that this was the best bug spray, so imagine my triumph when I looked it up on Amazon and saw that this is the bug spray I’ve already bought! I agree with Kristin’s assessment that the spray feels lightweight and the smell isn’t off-putting. This is a good time to stock up if you’re already planning your sunny holiday vacation. —Adrienne So I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell If you’re tired of getting on a ladder to put up your Christmas lights each year, try Govee’s Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro instead. They’re a set of permanent lights, designed to stay up all year and for years to come. These smart lights can handle a nice range of temperatures (from -4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and are weatherproof with an IP67 rating for the lights and an IP65 rating for the control box. WIRED reviewer Simon Hill says the adhesive works well to attach them to your home, and that installation for these permanent lights was easy overall. You can easily customize the lights for the holidays and months beyond using the Govee app to create almost any kind of color design or find any lighting effect you could hope for. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So As WIRED contributor Kristin Canning said, this treadmill has everything. It’s durable, well-built, and has a very decent top speed of 12 mph (that’s a 5-minute mile pace). It also has iFit, which is NordicTrack’s library of up to 10,000 workouts where you follow a trainer through gorgeous landscapes and have the treadmill automatically adjust your speed and incline. If it’s just too nasty to run outside right now, this is a great time to buy. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Bubble umbrellas are fun. They envelop your head and torso so there’s less rain slapping your face, and this one from ShedRain is see-through (and in our Best Umbrellas guide!). ShedRain is discounting everything by 30 percent, though some items are only available on its website and not on Amazon. That includes two I recently tested and like: The Duo, which makes it easier for a tall and short person to share the same umbrella, and the Vortex V2, a solid compact umbrella. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane The WIRED furbabies have spoken, and they approve of the Dagne Dover Kyoto Pet Carrier. Editor Julian Chokkattu’s pup, Tobu, loves the soft-sided carrier for beach trips. Editor Kat Merck’s cat, Scylla, has claimed it as her napping pod. No surprise there considering kitties adore the sherpa bed; the fact that it’s removable and washable is a win for pet parents. Other features worth noting: It’s TSA-compliant, includes seatbelt loops for car rides, and it’s collapsible for easy storage. —Boutayna Chokrane This is my absolute favorite bag in the entire world—no, I'm not exaggerating. It's easy to see why it went viral on TikTok. Not only does it fit a ton of stuff (I've managed to cram everything from multiple cartons of ice cream to a Surface Laptop Go 3 without overstuffing it) but it also has an adjustable shoulder strap (you can wear it as a crossbody or on your shoulder), and it's available in a bunch of fun colors and designs like Hello Kitty, stars, and more. Baggu also offers a larger version, which is also on sale for $50 ($12 off). —Brenda Stolyar If you’re a “quiet luxury” kind of person, Cuyana is holding a big Cyber Monday sale that includes one of our favorite tote bags and the travel beauty case. The best part about the System Tote—which gets its name from all the different add-ons that you can buy to customize your carrying needs—is that the handles are integrated with the leather, so there’s no possible failure points where the stitching can come undone. Editor Kat Merck also dropped the toiletry case onto hard tile from 5 feet up and didn’t damage any of her cosmetics. —Adrienne So No, a basic Travelpro soft-sided carry-on isn’t going to be the flashiest personal accompaniment when you’re going through the airport. But there’s a reason this is the brand most flight attendants have—you get a tremendous amount of bang for your buck. Our tester found that the handle was sturdy, the wheels rolled smoothly, and it weighs a mere 5.4 pounds. This is one of the best bags that you can get for around $100. —Adrienne So San Francisco-based Aer is known for its travel bags’ durability and minimalist designs, and the Aer Travel Pack 3 combines both of these with an unreal amount of organization. Our favorite work travel pack in our guide to the Best Carry-on Luggage, this bag can be carried as a backpack or a briefcase. It has a tech-organizing pocket in front of a larger compartment that zips flat to accommodate folded clothes or packing cubes, and it fits neatly under the seat on most airlines’ planes. The only down side is a weirdly small water bottle holder that won’t fit most larger water bottles (precisely the kind you’d want to bring for long trips). —Kat Merck An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale for Black Friday. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell Universal travel adapters are handy to have on your travels and this affordable adapter from Epicka works in more than 150 countries. Sliders reveal common international plugs for the EU, UK, and US, but you can rotate the pins for sockets in Australia or China. You can plug in power-hungry devices, like laptops and camera batteries, but there are also four USB-A ports on the bottom and a 15-watt USB-C port on the side for phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other small gadgets. It’s not the sturdiest option, but it's cheaper than most of the alternatives. This is the budget pick in our best travel adapters guide and is frequently discounted, but well worth buying at this price. —Simon Hill A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So If you want to fly with only an underseat item, the wheels on this teeny, tiny carry-on pop off so you can simply slide it under your seat (although I flew with it on Alaska Airlines and it fit without me taking the wheels off). The wheels are easy to pop off and tuck into the seat pocket. However, they are loud and rattle when you’re walking, especially over rough surfaces like sidewalks. If this doesn’t make you grit your teeth, this tiny suitcase is impressively functional for the price. —Adrienne So The Beis Carry On is viral for a reason. It's not only a beautiful bag, coming in an eye-catching array of colors (I’ve got the bag in the light-blue slate, but the warm brown maple color is always calling my name), but also comes with a bunch of great features. A built-in weight! A bag lock! Two organizer bags that match the color of your bag! A soft cushion for your hand on the handle! If I could take this bag everywhere, I would. It's 30 percent off right now, and Beis doesn't often have sales, so there’s no better time to upgrade your carry-on luggage. —Nena Farrell This duffel bag is great as a weekender or personal item to tote on top of your rolling suitcase. It's also big enough to be a great hospital bag if you suddenly need emergency surgery (yes, that's from experience!) and can be a great bag for all your dance class shoes. The material is sturdy but still stylish, and I find myself grabbing this bag often for all kinds of reasons, from needing to transport multiple water bottles to my weekend trip needs. —Nena Farrell Our favorite toiletry bag for women is the Beis Dopp Kit. It has a handful of handy compartments, and WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane says the water-resistant section is a total game changer when packing liquids or fragrances. It's nice and sturdy, with a wire top that will stay open for you to look through without losing its shape. It's on the large size compared to other Dopp kits, but that means you can truly store everything you need in this kit. If you need even more space, Beis' Cosmetic Case, another Gear team favorite, is 30 percent off. —Nena Farrell Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane This super svelte smart wallet is durable and provides easy and swift access to your cards, thanks to a trigger button that pops them out of the top. It has a leather exterior in a choice of colors. The inside is made from recycled aluminum and holds four regular cards easily, though you can add more cards or cash using the band around the outside. Ekster also offers a ton of optional add-ons, including a tracker card and a multi-tool. I also love the Ekster Cardholder Pro at $84 ($15 off), and the Ekster Grid Backpack for $180 ($45 off) was the perfect way to travel light on my last work trip. —Simon Hill Peak Design's recently revamped Tech Pouch isn't a camera bag, but it's my favorite way to store all the extra stuff I carry—batteries, chargers, cords, SD cards, filters, etc. I fit all that in the nicely subdivided compartments of the tech pouch and then throw the pouch in whichever bag I'm taking with me that day. There are plenty of pockets, and some nice elastic accessory loops to organize all your bits and bobs, and there's even a cable pass-through so you can charge without having to pull out your portable battery. —Scott Gilbertson Though it is bigger than many of the best travel adapters, this versatile gadget covers most of the globe and offers two grounded US AC outlets, a built-in USB-C cable, two USB-A ports (15 watts total), and two USB-C ports (20 watts each). There is surge protection, but this is not a voltage converter. Unfortunately, the two AC outlets are close together, so the size of some plugs can make it challenging to use both simultaneously. But with the ability to charge up to seven devices, this is worth packing in your suitcase. —Simon Hill The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson Wanna be a YouTube star? This is the camera you need. The 18- to 50-mm (f/1.8 to f/4) equivalent zoom lens is plenty sharp and wide, and the Multi-Face Recognition mode is extremely clever and effective. In this mode, the ZV-1 II will detect when another face comes into the scene and automatically stops down the aperture to keep everyone in focus. There are limits, but it works surprisingly well. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson Fujifilm's Instax Link Wide Printer is my favorite Instax printer. The printers aren't as fun as the cameras, but I already have a digital camera, and the results I get pairing images from a real camera with an Instax printer outshine what I get from Instax cameras. If you already have a good digital camera or a solid smartphone camera, an Instax printer is the way to go and this is the best one to get. I love the bigger images of the Link Wide, and it has nice extras like the ability to print multiple images in one go with collage print or add fun features to your images like hearts, glitter (shudder), or any other of the 15 editable templates in the app. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson It’s hard to make videos, OK? Teleprompters can be a game-changer because you have a script! No more floundering and getting frustrated. The models that let your camera sit behind them are best because it doesn’t look obvious that you’re reading text. The Elgato Prompter (8/10, WIRED Recommends) does all of that and supports smartphones too. The companion app turns your script into scrolling text, and the built-in screen is sharp and easy to read. It’s pretty expensive but this deal makes it palatable. —Julian Chokkattu The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson Read next Read next

Title: Why Is Chevron Corporation (CVX) Among the Best American Energy Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other American energy stocks. The energy industry includes stocks that are involved in the production or supply of energy. Companies engaged in oil and gas drilling, refining, and discovering and developing oil or gas reserves are all part of the energy sector or industry. The energy industry also comprises integrated power utility companies that use renewable energy and coal. Energy companies continue to suffer challenges as oil supply exceeds demand. Oil prices have been below $70/barrel since early September. According to U.S. Bank Asset Management's senior investment strategy director, Rob Haworth: "The oil market is one that remains well supplied but isn’t well demanded." Although the U.S. economy is strong, other major oil users like China and Germany are experiencing economic challenges. As a result, global demand is lagging.” Nonetheless, a number of energy companies have made encouraging achievements in 2024, and investors have reaped financial rewards as the energy sector of the broader market has grown by 12.74% since the start of the year. Based on exceptional results in 2021 and 2022, it has increased by 19.89% in just three years and by 10.61% growth over the previous five years. However, according to RSM’s Energy Outlook 2024 report, the North American energy sector will confront significant potential problems due to a global move toward renewable energy sources, aging infrastructure, and rising electricity consumption. Infrastructure limitations continue to be a major obstacle. Scalability concerns have been brought to light by record U.S. oil and natural gas output as well as a boom in renewable energy, affecting projects like solar farms in California and drilling in Texas. These challenges show how urgently infrastructure modernization investments are needed. As per the aforementioned report, North America's demand for electricity has increased to levels not seen in many years. Emerging technologies like green hydrogen, the use of electric vehicles, and growing data centers are important drivers. The use of machine learning and other analytical AI technology is growing among energy companies. This change alters the energy sector and aligns with tax incentives and the company's environmental, social, and governance goals. Most importantly, integrating clean energy is essential as companies adjust to meet rising demand sustainably. According to BloombergNEF, $303 billion was spent on U.S. renewable energy in 2023, a 22% increase from the year before, showing the continued pace of the energy transformation. Globally, $1.77 trillion was invested, signifying a strong push toward decarbonization. Even though renewable energy requires more cash, companies of all sizes—from startups to established oil and gas companies—are shifting their focus to renewables as the case for clean energy grows. This change sets up the energy industry for a significant and sustainable future. We sifted through holdings of Energy ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 American Energy stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. We have used the stock's market cap as of November 21, 2024, as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) An aerial view of an oil rig at sea, the sun glinting off its structure. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 63 Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a global energy business that engages in exploration, production, and refining. It produces 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which includes 1.8 million barrels of liquids and 7.7 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, making it the second-largest oil company in the United States. Production occurs throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, and North America. It can refine 1.8 million barrels of oil per day at its refineries in the US and Asia. At the end of 2023, proven reserves were 11.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which included 30.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 6.0 billion barrels of liquids. CVX has surged by over 8% since the start of 2024, coming through as one of the best American stocks to buy. Despite a decline from the previous year, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)'s third-quarter adjusted earnings were above market forecasts. The Permian Basin's record output propelled the company's 7% YoY growth in net oil-equivalent production. The company also started production on significant Gulf of Mexico projects in the United States. It announced a $6.5 billion Canadian asset sale and repurchased $4.7 billion worth of shares during the quarter. By the end of 2026, the company intends to cut structural expenses by $2-3 billion. On November 4, 2024, RBC Capital raised Chevron Corporation's (NYSE:CVX) price target to $175 from $170, maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. Although there is still uncertainty surrounding the Hess (HES) deal, the company's remarks regarding peak Permian capex in 2024 should bode well for free cash flow into 2025 and beyond, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Its Q3 results included a strong operational performance that culminated in an earnings and cash flow beat relative to market expectations. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey's database. It owns 118,610,534 shares worth $17.47 billion as of Q3. Overall CVX ranks 5th on our list of the best American energy stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for CVX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CVX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Election 2024 live updates: Ministers fighting for seats; tallies show Gerry Hutch in contention; tight battle to decide biggest party

The first day of counting is drawing to a close with the number of seats filled surpassing 30 - those include the larger party leaders Simon Harris, Mary Lou McDonald and Micheál Martin. Counting is continuing in six constituencies. Both Harris and Martin have expressed their optimism that they will be part of any government formed in the coming weeks, although they look set to fall short of an majority. Meanwhile, the performance of Gerry Hutch has been the big talking point of the day. Could he be elected? Our writers give an update on the Dublin Central situation. [ Election 2024 key race alerts: We analyse the count contests that matter mostOpens in new window ] You can follow all of our counts in amazing detail, with really excellent tables, stats and graphic on The Irish Times Results Hub. As of now, 35 seats out of 174 have been filled. The final percentages will depend on the last few first counts to be held but it’s interesting to see that the order of the three larger parties from last night’s exit poll have been reversed. Fianna Fáil is the lead party with 21.5 per cent of support. Fine Gael has 20.7 per cent support. And Sinn Féin has 18.7 per cent. Labour and the Social Democrats are very close, both at about 4.7 per cent. The Greens managed to get 3 per cent of the vote but that might not translate into any seats. I did a run through all 43 constituencies to make a seat projection. As of now, my projections for seats are: Fianna Fáil: 49 Fine Gael: 40 Sinn Féin 38: Independents: 19 Social Democrats: 10 Labour: 8 Independent Alliance: 5 People Before Profit: 3 Aontú: 1 Green Party 1. There is a big health warning with that as the last seats will be very keenly contested, and I suspect Fianna Fáil’s total may slip a little on critical seats on the final counts. For example, I’ve projected three seats for the party in Carlow-Kilkenny but that might not materialise. Likewise, I have only assigned one to it in Mayo but it may end up getting two. Cork North West will be very close. So will Dublin Mid West where Fianna Fáil might lose out to combined transfers of centre-left parties and candidates. What looks a possibility at this stage is that Fianna Fáil will be the biggest party with Fine Gael marginally ahead of Sinn Féin. If these projections are correct Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will be close to a majority, but will probably seek a third party to give the Government stability. Thank you for staying with us during the course of the evening and night. We will be back early in the morning! Stephen Maguire reports: Pearse Doherty’s huge surplus has swept his running mate Padraic Mac Lochhlainn to the second seat in the five-seat Donegal. The Inishowen TD did not need too many of the 6,000 spare votes as he was close to the quota himself after Count 1. Vivienne Clarke reports: The Offaly count is concluded with Fianna Fail’s Tony McCormack and Fine Gael’s John Clendennen, both seasoned councillors, taking the final two seats, narrowly defeating Sinn Féin’s Aoife Masterson. In the seventh count, Mr Clendennen, with 8,627, had only 116 votes to spare over Ms Masterson who had 8,501. Tony McCormack was a little ahead at 9,151. David Forsythe writes: The leader of Independent Alliance Michael Collins has been elected in the three-seat Cork South West. The three outgoing TDs - the other two are Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns and Fianna Fáil Christopher O’Sullivan - are expected to be re-elected. Mr Collins total of 12,295 votes exceeded the quota of 11,824. Mr Collins said: “I’d like to pay tribute to my canvas team and the people of Cork South West who put their faith in me again.” He said he expected Independent Ireland to return to the Dáil with “two or three” extra TDs. He added: “Where Independent Ireland was on the paper we were strong and it looks at this present time that we could take between five and eight seats. If a party that had three TDs can return with six I’d be very pleased with that.” Could Gerry Hutch be elected? Well-known criminal remains in contention for Dáil seat in Dublin Central https://t.co/nPAWHfUEpm via @IrishTimes Stephen Farrell reports: Peter Burke of Fine Gael is elected after completion of long awaited first count. Counting adjourned until tomorrow morning. You can see the full results here. Burke won 17.56 per cent, getting 10,884 votes. Fianna Fáil’s Longford TD Joe Flaherty looks like he is in trouble, with Fine Gael set to gain a second seat through Michael Carrigy. Arthur Beesley reports: Fine Gael’s Frank Feighan topped the poll in the first Sligo-Leitrim count with 8,890 first-preference votes, leaving the incumbent TD 2,401 votes short of the quota. The result of the first count was declared by deputy returning officer Paraic O’Grady shortly after midnight, more than 15 hours after boxes were opened at 9am on Saturday. Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin came second with 7,764 votes, followed by Michael Clarke of Independent Ireland on 5,979 votes and Eamon Scanlon of Fianna Fáil with 5,913 votes. Kenny’s running mate Chris MacManus is on 5,173 votes. Scanlon running mates Edel McSharry is on 4,466 votes and Paddy O’Rourke is on 4,066 votes. Independent TD Marian Harkin is on 4,347 votes. Mr O’Grady adjourned the count until 9am on Sunday after eliminating Independent Diarmuid MacConville, Independent Ireland’s Caroline Corcoran and Party for Animal Welfare candidate Molly Candon. Cian O’Connell reports that Independent TD Seán Canney is the first to be elected in Galway East. Stephen Maguire reports: Pearse Doherty has amassed the highest number of first preferences in the State with almost 19,000 votes, over 6,000 above the quote in five-seat Donegal. As the second count gets underway, his surplus of 6,127 now being distributed. His running mate Pádraig Mac Lochlainn has an outside chance of getting in on Doherty’s surplus but it could be a long night at the Aura Leisure Centre in Letterkenny. Sinn Féin will take two seats with Fianna Fáil looking poised to take two with the final seat looking like a battle between Independents Thomas Pringle and Charles Ward. David Raleigh reports that veteran Fianna Fáil TD Willie O’Dea has been elected on the sixth count. Sinn Féin’s Maurice Quinlavin and Kieran O’Donnell look set to be elected in later counts with a battle between five candidates for the last seat. Elisa O’Donovan of the Social Democrats looks like she has the slight advantage here. On the back of topping the poll in Limerick City, FF veteran Willie O’Dea says he is currently writing his memoirs to be published after he retires from political life - but first, tonight, after waiting on six counts to be reach the quota in this four-seater, he is going to the pub with his supporters to celebrate. Fianna Fáil candidates have finished in the top three positions in five-seat Carlow-Kilkenny, with a chance of getting all three elected. John McGuinness topped the poll, followed by Jennifer Murnane O’Connor and Peter ‘Chap’ Cleere. Sinn Féin’s two candidates have done exceptionally well despite neither being an elected representative. Fine Gael’s Catherine Callaghan is the front-runner of her party’s three candidates. Green Party Minister Malcolm Noonan with 4.18 per cent of the vote is not going to hold onto his seat on those figures. Latest results from Carlow-Kilkenny here. John Fallon reports: The first count has been finally announced in Galway West. Sinn Féin’s Mairéad Farrell has done exceptionally well and has topped the pool with 8,164 votes, a little under 2,000 votes short of the quota of 10.047. The big surprise has been the poor showing of celebrity candidate Gráinne Seoighe who has won 2,929 votes (about 6 per cent) and will not be in the running for a seat. Her Fianna Fáil running mate, John Connolly, is in second position with 7,197 votes and looks like he will take a seat. Independents Catherine Connolly and Noel Grealish also look like they have polled strongly. Hildegarde Naughton looks the stronger of the two Fine Gael candidates. Get the latest Galway-West results here. Vivienne Clark is at the count centre for The Irish Times. OFFALY poll topper sitting Independent TD Carol Nolan is elected on the fifth count. pic.twitter.com/IcdCqHKbLm Sarah Burns reports: Count 6 in Dublin Central has been completed. Malachy Steenson has be eliminated. Gary Gannon is at 6,363 votes, Paschal Donohoe at 5,730, Gerard Hutch is at 3,733, Marie Sherlock is at 2,917, Mary Fitzpatrick is at 2,553 and Nease Hourigan is at 2,315. Counting adjourned for the night for Dublin Central and will resume at 10am. Hutch is currently almost 800 votes ahead of Sherlock and Steenson’s transfers will widen that gap. The only pathway for Sherlock is for transfers from Neasa Hourigan and Mary Fitzpatrick to tilt heavily in her direction. A thousand votes plus is still a big gap to make up in Dublin Central, especially with Gannon and Donohoe still in the race, and attracting transfers. Jack White reports: Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell received the majority of Neale Richmond’s transfers following the second count for Dublin Rathdown, though no candidates have been elected. Independent candidates Kevin Daly and Conor Murphy, and the National Party’s Garrett McCafferty have all been eliminated. Their votes are now being distributed among the 11 remaining candidates. Ms O’Connell remains in the lead with 6,573 votes, having received 198 of Mr Richmond’s 292 transfers. She is followed by Fianna Fáil councillor Shay Brennan (5,943) who received 30 transfers, independent councillor Michael Fleming (4,394) who received 14 transfers and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney (4,281) who received four transfers. Green Party minister Catherine Martin is in fifth place with 4,161 votes after receiving 15 transfers. Dublin-Rathdown results here. Emmet Malone writes: It is all over in Dún Laoghaire where Richard Boyd-Barrett and Cormac Devlin have both exceeded the quota after Shane O’Brien’s votes were distributed, and Barry Ward, who was 2,480 votes ahead of Hugo Mills of the Social Democrats, was deemed to be elected without reaching the quota. They all join Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, who had become the first candidate elected to the new Dáil, about six hours ago. Busy here now in Leopardstown where the seventh count will shortly wrap things up. Richie Boyd Barrett, Cormac Devlin and Barry Ward all set to bb elected with Jennifer Carroll MacNeill having topped the poll and made it in on the first count about six hours ago. pic.twitter.com/6iPCVWzDTS Marie O’Halloran reports: Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan benefited most from the transfers of former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell who was eliminated on the fifth count in Dublin Bay South with 1,956 votes. Mr O’Callaghan secured 399 transfers with Fine Gael’s Emma Blain receiving 351, the second highest number. Labour leader Ivana Bacik secured 310 transfers from Ms O’Connell while Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan received 291. Green Party candidate Hazel Chu was the next highest recipient with 171 transfers. Mr O’Callaghan is now just 59 votes behind Ms Bacik who is in second place with Mr Geoghegan still on course to be first elected to the four-seat constituency. Our reporter Sorcha Pollak has posted this video: Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie has been elected in Dublin West, securing the constituency’s third seat. She joins FF’s Jack Chambers and SF’s Paul Donnelly who were elected on the first count earlier today. The count for the hotly contested remaining two seats continues tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/SSsjudEPFO Cormac McQuinn spoke to former Green Party leader about his party’s performance in the general election.

Representing Tipperary North, he topped the poll - making his seventh consecutive General Election win. Asked if he will be talking to whoever forms the next government, and he replied: “Absolutely.” Mr Lowry, who met with outgoing Taoiseach Simon Harris before the election, added: “I’ve always been positive in my approach to politics.” He smiled as he dodged questions about what he talked about and what he hoped he could gain by supporting any government Mr Harris would be a part of or even lead. “I’m not in the business of saying,” he said. “Being successful in supporting a government is to know when to say nothing. “All I can say is that I have worked with Bertie Ahern, Brian Cowen, Enda Kenny, Leo Varadkar and with Simon Harris. “It’s a case of, how shall I put it, knowing when to ask and you have to know when to ask.” On his Dail win, he added: “I am only as good as the supporters who made me.” Conor Gallagher reports: Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey has become the third and final TD elected in Meath West. She will join returning along with Sinn Féin TD Johnny Guirke, who topped the poll, and Aontú leader and returning TD, Peadar Tóibín, into the 34th Dáil following the completion of counting late on Saturday night. Ms Dempsey, the daughter of former Fianna Fáil minister Noel Dempsey, narrowly beat Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray in a fierce battle for transfers and surpluses. She received 17 per cent of first preference votes compared to Ms Murray’s 16 per cent. The contours of the race were obvious from the early afternoon when tallies showed Mr Tóibín and Mr Guirke all but certain to take a seat and either Ms Dempsey or Ms Murray in contention for the third. Former Fine Gael turned independent councillor Noel French, who received 11 per cent of first perferences was quickly out of the running while the remaining seven candidates hardly featured at all. Six of them polled at 1.5 per cent or less. Mr Guirke was the first candidate returned, repeating his poll-topping perforamce of 2020, albeit with a significantly reduced vote. His supporters hoisted him on their shoulders alongside a Tricolour and sang Oró, Sé Do Bheatha ‘Bhaile in celebration. “Absolutely delighted. After losing a big area of west Meath where I got 40 per cent of the poll, to come in here and top the poll,” Mr Guirke said. Aisling Dempsey hugs her father, ex FF minister Minister Noel Dempsey after being elected as the third and final TD in #Meathwest. We're done and dusted. Amazing work by the count staff here pic.twitter.com/iOSWyeSzJc Barry Roche reports: From Barry Roche, Cork Tanaiste and Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin has romped home on the first count in Cork South Central with over 4,000 votes to spare in his ninth election since he first won a Dáil seat in 1989. Martin polled 14,742 in 2002 when he polled 26.69 of the vote and he was just 226 votes short of that total when he came in on this occasion 14,526 confirming his status as the most popular Fianna Fail leader in Cork since Jack Lynch Martin’s huge surplus of 4075 looks like propelling running mate Seamus McGrath – brother of former Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath if not over then close to quota with McGrath polling a highly credible 7794 to take second spot. After Martin’s surplus was distributed after the first count, McGrath was at 9,940, only 500 votes short of the quota. Sinn Fein’s Donnachadh O Laoghaire looks poised to hold his seat with 6,947 while Fine Gael are set to hold Simon Coveney’s seat most likely through Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Jerry Buttimer who leads his running mate Shane O’Callaghan by 4407 to 3364. Aside from Martin’s storming home on the first count, the story of Cork South Central is that of Social Democrat Padraig Rice, a native of Camp in West Kerry, who looks to win the Soc Dems’ first seat in Cork city after he polled an impressive 5368. Former Lord Mayor of Cork, Independent Mick Finn is still in with a slim chance of the last seat after he polled 3,582 – ahead of Labour’s Laura Harmon and Sinn Fein’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid, Anna Daly of Aontu, Úna McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens. OFFALY results of 4th count, Carol Nolan now only 200 votes off quota of 9347. Fifth count has commenced. Keep up to date with @IrishTimes live election blog pic.twitter.com/ydkyf1MDll Kevin O’Sullivan writes: On the election outcome, Sadhbh O’ Neill, who stood for Labour in Waterford, expressed dismay that climate change did not feature strongly in the debates and hustings. “It feels like the election took place inside a bubble of denial and delay. No matter who ends up forming a government, it is vital that Ireland acts to develop plans to help us prepare for weather extremes. “Candidates and parties should have been interrogated on how they plan to both adapt to and mitigate climate change in Ireland. “Even non-controversial areas of decarbonisation like bringing our public transport up to European norms were not addressed in any meaningful way by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin. “That makes me very fearful of how these parties will tackle more challenging topics like data centres, high electricity costs and sustainable land use, because if the next government doesn’t act we’re all in big, big trouble.” Ms O’Neill is a noted environmental activist and was formerly a member of the Green Party. Arthur Beesley writes from Sligo: With the Sligo-Leitrim first count still awaited 13 hours after boxes were opened, Independent TD Marian Harkin has acknowledged she faces a struggle to retain her seat. Ms Harkin’s secured in region of 7.6 per cent of the first-preference vote, according to the tally, down from 11.5 per cent in the 2020 election. “We had hoped for better because we got such a positive response,” she said just before 10pm at the Sligo count centre. “What I’m hoping is that that positive response will translate into twos and threes. As I said earlier, there’s a pathway. It’s narrow and it’s slippy.” She faces a battle against Chris MacManus of Sinn Féin and Michael Clarke of Independent Ireland for the fourth and final seat. Tallies suggest the first three seats are likely to go to Fine Gael’s Frank Feighan, Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin and Eamon Scanlon of Fianna Fáil. Fiachra Gallagher reports that the Kildare North count has been suspended until 9am tomorrow. They are yet to get a first count. Emmet Malone writes: Sinn Fein’s Shane O’Brien has been eliminated in Dún Laoghaire after receiving just 100 of Ossian Smyth’s transfers and being overtaken by Hugo Mills of the Social Democrats who got 2,003. O’Brien’s departure from the race should be very good news for Richard Boyd-Barrett who got about 80 per cent of his transfers when he went out four years ago, enough to push the People Before Profit candidate well over the quota on that occasion. Fifty per cent would be more than enough to get Boyd Barrett over the line this time but if he somehow doesn’t make it, it’s hugely unlikely Hugo Mills will overtake him. The gap is 1,023. The count centre is filling up, meanwhile, with the other remaining candidates and their supporters as the process approaches its end. Barry Ward of Fine Gael has been receiving a lot of congratulations from well wishers including MEP Regina Doherty. Barry Andrews has also around the place showing support for Cormac Devlin. Both men also look set to be elected within the next hour. Neil Michael writes: Mattie McGrath had topped the poll in South Tipperary with 10,014 votes after the first count. But as it was just shy of the 10,270 quota, it now goes to a second count before his win can be confirmed. Five candidates were eliminated and their votes distributed. A last minute but unspecified issue has held up the first count of the Tipperary North constituency, where Michael Lowry has topped the poll. In Tipperary South, Michael Murphy (Fine Gael) looks poised to take the second seat with a three-way battle for the third seat between outgoing Sinn Féin TD Martin Browne, Fianna Fáil’s Imelda Goldsboro, and Independent Séamus Healy. Carl O’Brien writes: Taoiseach Simon Harris has been elected on the first count in Wicklow while Fianna Fáil TD and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is facing a battle to retain his seat. Mr Harris topped the poll with 16,869 votes, exceeding the 11,415 quota by more than 5,000 votes. Bray-based Sinn Féin TD John Brady is in second place (8,450 votes), followed by Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore (7,699). Both deputies look set to retain their seats. A tight race is unfolding for the final spot in the four-seat constituency between Stephen Donnelly (3,553), Independent candidate and former Fine Gael councillor Shay Cullen (3,232) and Fine Gael’s Edward Timmins (3,050). Mr Harris’s transfers look set to play a key role in deciding where the final seat goes. While a strong transfer rate to the Taoiseach’s Fine Gael running mate in west Wicklow is expected, tallies indicate significant numbers will also go to Donnelly who is based in the Taoiseach’s hometown of Greystones. Newtownmountkennedy-based Shay Cullen decided to stand as an independent after missing out on a place on the Fine Gael ticket. Independent Bray-based candidate Cllr Joe Behan is further behind in the contest (2,909) followed by sitting Green Party TD Steven Matthews (2,366) who looks set to lose his seat. Marie O’Halloran writes: Former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell has been eliminated after the fourth count in Dublin Bay South. Ms O’Connell ran as an independent and garnered a total of 1,956 votes. Poll topper James Geoghegan is on course to be elected first. He has 6,171 but he is still 1,800 votes short of the quota of 7,957. Interest in the next count will be on where Ms O’Connell’s transfers go. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín has been re-elected in Meath West after reaching the quota on the fourth count. Johnny Guirke (Sinn Féin) already elected. Battle between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for the last seat. Sarah Burns reports: The first count has come in for the ‘People’s Republic of Dublin South Central’. Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh has topped the poll with 4,497 first preferences, followed by Fianna Fáil’s Catherine Ardagh with 3,988 votes, Sinn Féin’s Máire Devine with 3,854 votes, the Social Democrats Jen Cummins with 3,347 votes, People Before Profit’s Hazel de Nortúin with 3,331 votes, Sinn Féin’s Daithí Doolan with 3,290 votes and Fine Gael’s Mary Seery Kearney with 3,056 votes. Independent Ireland candidate Michael Fitzmaurice has been elected on the first count, topping the poll. It looks like Claire Kerrane (Sinn Féin) and Martin Daly (Fianna Fáil) will fill the other two seats here. Fitzmaurice disclosed in an interview a short while ago that Daly was his family GP. It also means that two of the three TDS in the constituency will be from Co Galway, albeit both of them in parishes within a stone’s throw of Roscommon. Sarah Burns reports: Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has been elected on the third count in Dublin Central. Following the transfer of Sinn Féin’s Janice Boylan transfers, Gerard Hutch is at 3,295 votes, Labour’s Marie Sherlock at 2,521 votes, Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick at 2,446 votes. Jack White writes: Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond has been elected while the Green Party minister Catherine Martin was placed sixth following the first count for Dublin Rathdown. Mr Richmond received 10,044 votes against a quota of 9,752. He was followed by Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell (6,375), Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan (5,913), independent councillor Michael Fleming (4,380) and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney (4,277). The Green Party’s Catherine Martin came sixth in the four-seat constituency following the first count, receiving 4,146 first preference votes. She was narrowly behind Social Democrats’ candidate Sinéad Gibney. It was a significant fall from her 8,958 first preference votes in 2020, the highest number received that year. Mr Richmond’s surplus of 292 will be transferred tonight. Dublin Rathdown saw a turnout of 60.60 per cent, a slight reduction from 63.65 per cent in 2020. Following his election, Mr Richmond said he and councillor Maeve O’Connell were given a “very clear task” by Taoiseach Simon Harris to retain two seats for the party. “It looks like we will, but personally, obviously I’m chuffed, and hopefully we’ll see a lot more Fine Gael seats elected over the coming hours and days,” he said, anticipating the party to return more TDs than in 2020. “We ran as a really united ticket that delivered two seats for Fine Gael in Dublin Rathdown once again, even though many people said we couldn’t do it,” he said, adding that he expects Ms O’Connell to be elected on Sunday morning. Jack Horgan-Jones reports: Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has arrived to the RDS, delivering a stinging verdict on Sinn Féin while saying his party is “in the early days” of a very positive result. “Until a few days ago I heard many predictions of a very difficult election for Fine Gael, and that’s not going to happen,” he said. Asked about the performance of gangland figure Gerry Hutch, who has a definite pathway to a seat in Dublin Central as well, Mr Donohoe said that it was important to note the vast majority of people in Dublin Central had not voted for him. “We will have to reflect in due course regarding why he performed like he did, but the big picture today is one of the centre holding.” “At a time when incumbent governments all over Europe are struggling to get re-elected, the two larger parties within this government and in particular Fine Gael, are going to deliver a very strong performance.” Regarding Sinn Féin’s performance, he said it was “now very evident they are the weakest opposition party in Europe” Despite a cost of living crisis and the lingering effects of Covid, he said any gains for Sinn Féin would be minimal, accusing the party of being unable to answer basic questions on the campaign trail. “Their share of vote and any electoral gains they make will be amongs the weakest of any opposition party in Europe.” Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond has been elected following first count in Dublin Rathdown Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond has been elected following the first count for Dublin Rathdown, receiving 10,044 votes against a quota of 9,752 pic.twitter.com/GbxcMZHrGm Cian O’Connell writes: the second count is finished in Galway East. The big story from Galway East is that the 25 year-old chairman of Galway County Council has topped the poll, seemingly at the expense of outgoing Fianna Fáil TD Anne Rabbitte, who received just 4,056 first preference votes, over 6,000 short of the quota. It will come as a blow to the party. Ms Rabbitte is the current Minister of State for Disabilities and has held a high profile since first being elected to the Dáil in 2016. Treatment of workers in the care sector became a major issue during the election campaign after footage emerged of outgoing Taoiseach Simon Harris’ interaction with disability worker Charlotte Fallon in Cork. Concerns raised by Ms Fallon led to widespread criticism of the government’s handling of the care sector. If Ms Rabbitte is to lose her seat in Galway East, it will raise further questions on the issue. The minister will be hoping for a turnaround through transfers, but she faces a very difficult battle. Read the detailed breakdown on the Galway East Counts here. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has been elected in Dublin Central on the third count. Carl O’Brien reports: Taoiseach Simon Harris said he is “very confident” that Fine Gael will have a “very significant role” to play in Government formation talks. Speaking at the count centre in his Wicklow constituency, he said that while it was difficult to say who will be the biggest party in the next Dáil, he was “cautiously optimistic and excited about the weeks ahead.” He said the Fine Gael parliamentary party which he will lead will be “massively different” with new TDs who will bring “new ideas and new perspective to Leinster House”. Mr Harris said it was clear the party “will gain seats” and “top the poll in at least 10 constituencies” and add second seats across a number of constituencies. “I think the people of Ireland have now spoken. We now have to work out exactly what they have said. That is going to take a little bit of time ... “We need to be patient in relation to that. Of course, my party will act responsibly in the days ahead,” he said. “I am really grateful to the Irish people for the mandate they have given me and my party.” In relation to Sinn Féin, he said there has been “so sign of a Sinn Féin surge” and claimed the party’s vote was likely to be down on the last election. “The two larger parties are likely to receive significant support from the electorate. So, definitely politics in Ireland has gotten much more fragmented,” he said. In relation to the performance of Gerard Hutch in the election, Mr Harris said the “people are sovereign” but said he believed he “wasn’t nailed on yet”. With 11 TDS already elected to the Dáil, our political editor Pat Leahy has projected that the two outgoing Coalition partners will have more than 80 seats and will be close to having the numbers to form a Government, albeit needing support. Here is Pat’s take: Projections for the vote share of the three biggest parties suggest that Fianna Fáil will win the largest share of votes, with 21.9 per cent of first preferences, with Fine Gael in second on 20.5 per cent and Sinn Féin in third place on 19.1 per cent. Those figures are subject to revision when first counts are all in but party analysts do not expect them to change substantially. Extrapolating seat numbers from those vote chare figures is notoriously tricky. But Fianna Fáil has some things working in its favour – including lots of incumbent candidates and strong transfers from Fine Gael. Most seat projections for the party put them somewhere in the mid-40s, with some suggesting nearer to 50, though party insiders play down the most optimistic scenarios. Fine Gael believes that it will be in the low 40s, anticipating favourable results in s amll number of place that would bring it over the 40 mark. If both these estimates are right, it will mean that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil between them will be in the mid-80s – not all that far away from the magic number of 88 which constitutes a majority in the next Dáil. But enough to need the support of either another party or a bunch of independents to form a Government with a workable majority. Johnny Guirke was elected on the third count in Meath West, having topped the poll. Supporters in the hall Trim GAA Club hoisted him on their shoulders alongside a Tricolour and sang Oró, Sé Do Bheatha Abhaile in celebration. “Absolutely delighted. After losing a big area of west Meath where I got 40 per cent of the poll, to come in here and top the poll,” Mr Guirke said. “I’m delighted for the Sinn Féin team, I’m delighted for the party and I’m delighted for myself and my family.” Mr Guirke said he intends to prioritise local issues in the 34th Dáil, including the building of the proposed Navan rail line. “I work hard on the ground. I’m not one of these that looks for media attention. My strengths are on the ground and the people have honoured that today.” On his party’s performance nationwide, he said: “If you said a couple of weeks ago we are where we are today, we’d have taken the hand off you. I think we’re flying across the country.” The counting is continuing with Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín looking likely to be returned next on the back of the transfers independent councillor Noel French, who has been eliminated. That leaves Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey (17 per cent) and Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray (16 per cent) in a fierce battle for the final seat. Just 275 votes separate the women. Fianna Fáil’s James O’Connor, the youngest TD in the 33rd Dáil is in joint 1st place to retain his seat according to tallies but the seats will ultimately come down to transfers, he said pic.twitter.com/ioBxCRaBmv Jade Wilson reports: The first count has been completed in Louth, and Sinn Féin’s Ruairi Ó Murchú topped the poll with 8,728 votes, followed by fellow Sinn Féin candidate Joanna Byrne, who received 8,169 votes. Labour’s Ged Nash is polling third with 7,594 votes. However, no candidate has reached the quota in Louth in the first count, which requires 10,623 votes to be elected. Others following closely behind include Fianna Fáil’s Erin McGreehan at 5,772 votes, and Fine Gael candidate Paula Butterly with 5,646 votes. But John McGahon, who has been involved in controversy over a 2018 assault, now looks unlikely to win a seat for Fine Gael with just 4,021 first preference votes. One candidate, independent David Carroll, was eliminated, with his 40 votes to be redistributed. Taoiseach Simon Harris has just said that it’s unlikely that McGahon will be elected and Paula Butterly is his party’s best chance of winning a seat in Louth, based on the first count returns. Sorcha Pollak writes: Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly have both been elected to the Dublin West constituency. Mr Chambers secured 9,446 first preference votes, far exceeding the quota of 7,373. Mr Donnelly also exceed the quota on the first count, securing 7,731 votes. The total poll for Dublin West was 44,593 out of an electorate of 78,034, while 357 spoiled votes were registered. The total valid poll was 44,236. A surplus of 2,073 votes will now be distributed in the second count. Fine Gael’s Emer Currie is still on track to secure the constituency’s third seat, with 6,791 first preference votes. Ms Currie is expected to benefit substantially from Mr Chambers’ transfers. PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is sitting in fourth place, with 3,552 first preference votes, while Green Party Leader Roderic O’Gorman is holding on to fifth place with 2,909. The Green Party leader will be in a huge battle to retain his seat.

Donnelly secured the second seat in the constituency in the first count with 7,731 votes, following Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers’ poll topping 9,446. pic.twitter.com/oSSQ56Fntt Kitty Holland reports: Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin is the second Sinn Féin TD home, exceeding the quota in Dublin Mid West, topping the poll with 9,892 first preferences and elected on the first count. The quota in this five-seater is 7,913 on a valid poll of 47,476. He is followed by his running mate, Mark Ward TD, who garnered 5,323 first preferences and who will pick up a substantial number of Ó Broin’s almost 2,000 transfers. Emer Higgins (Fine Gael) is coming in third on 4,798 votes, followed closely by Fianna Fáil’s Shane Moynihan on 4,746. Sitting TD Gino Kenny, People Before Profit, with 2,608 votes is trailing behind Fine Gael’s Vicky Casserly (3,723), Independent Paul Gogarty (3,646) and the Social Democrats’ Eoin Ó Broin (2,907). Kenny’s vote appears to have been squeezed by both a crowded left – including Labour’s Francis Timmons on 2,270 votes, and by the right in his north Clondalkin neighbour, Glen Moore of the Irish Freedom Party, on 1,435 votes and Linda de Courcy of Independent Ireland on 1,823.

Another ballot paper included the message " none of these at all”. In Dublin Bay South some voters wrote down their preferences for actors, singers and celebrities including Abba and American singer and actress Demi Lovati, who appeared on Barney & Friends. Count officials in Dublin Central said there were 127 votes for consideration they believed should be allowed as they displayed them for candidates’ election agents to peruse. They included papers with 1,2 and 3 preferences followed by two ticks. The first three preferences were allowed. Some 11 papers were left blank. In Dublin Bay South one voter showed a liking for sequences marking – 1,2,2 and then 1,2,2 all the way down the list of candidates. And another voter put a tick beside every candidate’s name.

Speaking at the count centre at Treacy’s West County hotel in Ennis after posing for photos with the extended Garvey clan, the Inagh native said: “When you are the smallest party in Government you get a kicking and we got a kicking today.” She said: “I am not surprised. I think we were brave to go in as Coalition partners and what happened today has happened historically.” On her own performance, Senator Garvey said that 6 per cent of the first preference vote “is pretty good for a Green in Clare”. She said: “I am very pleased with how I have done.” However, Senator Garvey conceded that the gap between herself and Sinn Féin candidate, Donna McGettigan was too big to make up. She said: “I will do well on transfers but I don’t think I will do well enough. I cannot see myself passing her out.” Jennifer Bray sent us this post on X Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik says hers is a party of “deep roots and green shoots” - says “we are serious about delivering change.” She says govt formation talks will start next weeks and she will first speak to the left @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/lkXfAHlp3w From Barry Roche, in Cork: Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has romped home on the first count in Cork South Central with over 4,000 votes to spare in what is his second ever vote since he first won a Dáil seat in 1989. Martin polled 14,742 in 2002 when he polled 26.69 of the vote and he was just 226 votes short of that total when he came in on this occasion 14,526 confirming his status as the most popular Fianna Fáil leader in Cork since Jack Lynch. Martin’s huge surplus of 4,075 looks like propelling running mate Seamus McGrath – brother of former Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath, if not over then close to quota with McGrath polling a highly credible 7794 to take second spot. Sinn Féin’s Donnachadh Ó Laoghaire looks poised to hold his seat with 6,947 while Fine Gael are set to hold Simon Coveney’s seat most likely through Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Jerry Buttimer who leads his running mate Shane O’Callaghan by 4407 to 3364. Aside from Martin’s storming home on the first count, the story of Cork South Central is that of Social Democrat Padraig Rice, a native of Camp in West Kerry, who looks to win the Soc Dems’ first seat in Cork City after he polled an impressive 5368. Former Lord Mayor of Cork, Independent Mick Finn is still in with a slim chance of the last seat after he polled 3,582 – ahead of Labour’s Laura Harmon and Sinn Féin’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid, Anna Daly of Aontú, Una McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens. Returning Officer, Martin Harvey and his staff have begun the second count where they re-examine all Martin’s 14,526 papers to enable them to allocate his 4075 surplus to the remaining 21 candidates on a proportionate basis. Emmet Malone writes: Barry Ward has picked up about 60 per cent of Jennifer Carroll MacNeill’s 551 surplus in dun Laoghaire and is just under 2,500 off joining his running mate in the next Dáil. Carroll MacNeill said she was pleased to see her running mate, Barry Ward, in a strong position to take a second seat for the party in a constituency where it is generally regarded as having let one slip through its fingers last time around. “Two weeks ago we had a poll that showed me in a very, very, very, very strong position in the constituency. So we worked within our Fine Gael community to try to balance out that vote,” Ward finishing third on the first count, initially 2,797 off the quota, she said, had shown the strategy had worked. Elsewhere, she said the party was in contention for two seats in a number of constituencies and could be in for a better day than the exit poll might have suggested but, she said, “I think the best analysis I’ve seen is, ‘there’s a long way to go’.” Regarding her own election, said she was “really thrilled” to be elected again for the constituency and “really proud to be one of the small number of women who will be elected on first counts across the country”. Fianna Fáil’s Cormac Devlin picked up 116 second preference from Carroll MacNeill, the only other candidate to gain in any way significantly. Ossian Smyth picked up 23 transfers and still looks to have a huge fight on his hands to avoid being the constituency’s big loser this time around. Michael O’Doherty (Independent) and Cathy Lynch (The Irish People) are now being eliminated on 344 and 650 votes respectively. We have a comprehensive results hub on The Irish Times website including tables from each constituency. Sarah Burns reports: The first count completed in Dublin Central, and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has topped the poll with 6,389 votes. However, McDonald has just fallen short of the quota and did not get elected on the first count. The other dramatic development has been the showing of Gerard Hutch who is currently lying in fourth place, some 600 votes ahead of Marie Sherlock of Labour. She was followed by Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe with 5,493 votes, the Social Democrat’s Gary Gannon (4,353 votes), Independent Gerard Hutch (3,098 votes), Labour’s Marie Sherlock (2,465 votes), Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick got 2,344 vote and the Green Party’s Neasa Hourigan (1,952 votes). Independent Malachy Steenson received 1,602 first preferences, followed by People Before Profit’s Eoghan Ó Ceannabháin at 1,471, Independent Clare Daly with 1,317 and Sinn Féin’s Janice Boylan with 1,257. Vivienne Clarke is in our count centre in Offaly. Independent TD Carol Nolan has topped the poll in Offaly with 8,282 votes, a little over 1,000 short of the quota of 9,347. Fianna Fáil’s Tony McCormack (6,349) and Fine Gael’s John Clendennen (6,580) look favourites to take the remaining two seats, even though Aoife Masterson of Sinn Féin is also in contention with 6,211 votes. Full Offaly results here. Ellen O’Riordan writes: With 8,820 first preference votes, first time candidate Brian Brennan, a hotelier, has topped the poll as Fine Gael’s sole candidate in this new, three-seat constituency. Senator Malcolm Byrne – one of two Fianna Fáil candidates here – is a close second with 8,311 votes. In third is Sinn Féin councillor and Gaelscoil teacher Fionntán Ó Súilleabháin on 7,719. Fianna Fáil’s second candidate, Pat Kennedy, comes in a bit behind in fourth, with 5,478 votes. The 648 votes of Independent Ireland candidate Frances Lawlor and 168 votes of independent Lise-Marie Nolan will now be distributed, as they have been eliminated. Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan has topped the poll in Dublin Bay South with 6,060 votes in the first count, almost 2,000 short of the quota of 7,957. Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik is second on 5,684 with Jim O’Callaghan of Fianna Fáil in third with 5,536. Chris Andres of Sinn Féin lies fourth with 4,875 with Fine Gael’s second candidate Emma Blain amassing 4,102 votes. The Green Party seat looks at risk as Hazel Chu has 3,250 votes, which will make it difficult for her to retain the seat. The new Social Democrats candidate Eoin Hayes is ahead of her at 3,615 votes. Kate O’Connell, who stood as an independent, received 1,772 votes. The new three-seat constituency will have a new TD. Veteran Fine Gael councillor Willie Aird is to be elected at this first attempt at the Dáil with 9,269 votes. He was first elected as a councillor in 1979. Sitting Fianna Fáil TD Sean Fleming will be comfortably elected and is sitting at 8,123 votes. Brian Stanley, who left Sinn Féin in controversial circumstances, amassed 6,782 votes with a buffer of almost 2,000 votes over the Sinn Féin candidate, Maria McCormack, who garnered 4,914 votes. Darragh O’Brien of Fianna Fáil has topped the poll in Dublin Fingal East with 8,906 votes in the first count, some 500 votes short of the quota. There is a gap of over 3,000 votes between him and the next three candidates: Anne Graves of Sinn Féin, Duncan Smith of Labour and Alan Farrell of Fine Gael. All three are grouped between 5,379 and 5,450. The last two seats will therefrom be determined on transfers, and sitting TD Alan Farrell will find himself in a real battle to hold on to to his seat ahead of Sinn Féin. Sorcha Pollak writes: Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers, who is on track to top the poll in the Dublin West constituency, says he expects his party to “exceed 40 seats” in the general election. Speaking ahead of the first official count, the outgoing Minister for Finance and Fianna Fáil director of elections said it was “clear” his party would exceed the exit poll. “We’re in strong position for gains in many parts of the country, and obviously we have to wait the final counts and the general counting over the next 24 hours,” he said. Fianna Fáil is “in a strong position” and there is “real optimism in the party about possible gains”. Asked whether he would like to be reappointed as Minister for Finance in the next Dáil, Mr Chambers said the conversation was “not about positions” but “about the substance of policies”. “I’m happy to play whatever role I’m asked to say if we form a Government,” he said. Our colleague Jack White recorded Catherine Martin as she arrived at the count centre. She says that she is “very disappointed” with the party’s performance and says her sense it is the old story of the smaller party in Government suffering. She said the party has really delivered this time. She maintained that Roderic O’Gorman and Ossian Smyth remained in contention for the last seats in “very tight” contests. She also said she was still in a battle in Dublin Rathdown. Speaking to reporters at the Dublin Rathdown count in the last few minutes, Catherine Martin said it has been “a very disappointing day for the Green Party.” pic.twitter.com/mc4sAevKtG From David Raleigh: The Fine Gael Minister for Higher Education has been elected on the first count in Limerick county. He won 11,563 votes, some 200 votes above the quota of 11,385. It is likely that the two other seats in the three-seater will be filled by the incumbents, Niall Collins of Fianna Fáil (9,284) and Richard O’Donoghue of Independent Alliance (10,540). The next nearest candidate is Joanne Collins from Sinn Féin on 6,006. Jennifer Bray writes: Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said her “first port of call” when the votes are counted will be to reach out to parties on the left. Speaking in the RDS, McDonald said she felt her party had performed “very well” in the 2024 general election. “The first thing I want to say is to acknowledge every single person right across this state who came out to vote for Sinn Féin. You have given us, again, a powerful and strong mandate and we understand the trust you have placed in us to make life better for you and we are determined to do just that. This has been an incredible performance by all of our candidates. “Over a short number of weeks we have achieved a result that many people a few weeks ago would have thought was impossible, so thank you, thank you to everyone who voted for us. I said in the course of the campaign that I believed another five years of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is bad news for our society, our communities, for families who are struggling, for our housing crisis and nobody should forget the record homeless number we saw on election day itself. “We are now at a really important decision point for Irish society and politics, and we need change. We intend, when the votes are counted, and when we know the lie of the land, that we will be talking to people about Government.” McDonald said she felt her party had done “very very well.” “We have now confirmed that we have broken the political mould in this state. Two party politics is gone, it has been consigned to the dust bin of history. The question now arises for us, what do we do with that?” “The counts are still under way. We know we are in play in a number of constituencies: five, six, maybe seven. Other parties of the left similarly have secured a mandate. My first port of call will be with those parties.” Jade Wilson writes: Louth is now 100 per cent tallied. Topping the poll is incumbent Ruairí Ó Murchú (SF) at 13.52 per cent, followed by local councillor Joanna Byrne (SF): 13.03 per cent. Then Labour’s Ged Nash, who is at 12.02 per cent followed by Erin McGreehan (FF): 8.97 per cent, Paula Butterly (FG) at 8.83 per cent, and ‘local celebrity’ candidate, Alison Comyn (FF) at 7.78 per cent. On these figures it looks unlikely that John McGahon, on 6.21 per cent, will become a TD. Incumbent Sligo-Leitrim Fine Gael TD Frank Feighan believes his party will form the next Government with Fianna Fáil but left the door open for them to coalesce with any of Labour, the Social Democrats or Independents. After scraping into the Dáil on the 15th Sligo-Leitrim count in 2020, Mr Feighan expects swifter election this time out. The final tally put him leading the pack at 15.8 per cent, although the formal result of the first count is still some hours away. “It’s a great honour to be elected TD for Sligo-Leitrim-south Donegal,” Mr Feighan said at the count centre. “It’s too early to comment but it looks like it may be a good election for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and the numbers will dictate what Government,” he said. “I think the two main parties are there. After that I don’t know will it be Labour or Soc Dems or Independents. That will be a matter for people higher up in my party.” Incumbent Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny is well-placed to return to the Dáil, as is former Fianna Fáil TD Eamon Scanlon. “I’ll be hopeful that if things fall right for me that I will be able to hang in,” Mr Scanlon said. “I think we’re holding up,” he said of Fianna Fáil’s performance. Independent Ireland candidate Michael Clarke is in contention for the fourth and final seat. But Sinn Féin believes a strong showing in Sligo for Chris MacManus gives it a chance of winning a second seat. Conor Gallagher writes: The first count in Meath West has been completed with no candidates reaching the quota and six being eliminated. Sinn Féin TD Johnny Guirke remains in poll position with 8,604 first preference votes followed closely by Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín on 7,563. Both men look all but certain to retain their seats in the three-seat constituency. Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey (6,535) and Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray (6,164) are in a battle for the final seat. Former Fine Gael turned independent councillor Noel French in fifth on 3,969, followed by Ronan Moore of the Social Democrats on 2,542. Half the field were eliminated on the first count and their second preferences will now be distributed. They include Seamus McMenamin (Green Party), Ben Gilroy (Liberty Republic) and Sandy Gallagher (Labour). Just under 58 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot. There were 230 spoiled votes. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill has been elected on the first count in Dún Laoghaire with 11,685 votes. She narrowly exceeded the quota of 11.134. Cormac Devlin of Fianna Fáil is in second place (8,831 votes) with Fine Gael’s second candidate Barry Ward lying third with 8,337. People Before Profit’s leader Richard Boyd-Barrett has 6,795 votes and looks poised to take one of the four seats. As of now the Green Party’s Ossian Smyth with 4,297 votes looks like he will lose his seat unless he gathers transfers strongly from other candidates and stays ahead of other candidates of the centre-left. That looks unlikely. A gain for Fine Gael looks likeliest here. Martin Wall writes: Arriving at the Fingal East count he indicated he would like to continue in the housing portfolio. “This is the start of really significant chapter of Fianna Fáil in Dublin In Dublin in particular we are doing well. We will retain what we have and possible gain another three or four additional seat.” “We worked very hard over the last four and a half years to make our country better.” “If fortunate to be part of next Government, I will serve in whatever capacity I am asked to serve in.” “We are making progress in housing. We have a lot more work to do in housing and I would love to be part of that. But that is above my station.” Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald has arrived in the RDS to some pretty loud cheers and a wild scramble. What it’s like being in a scrum for Mary Lou McDonald.. @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/hmbqjhvBBS It is looking like a good day for the Soc Dems. Deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan indicates that his party is open to talking to arch rivals Labour about government formation pic.twitter.com/O3Akx44j6T Sinn Féin’s Johnny Guirke has topped the poll in Meath West with 8,604 votes, less than 1,000 short of the quota of 9,427. The second placed candidate is Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín who has 7,563. Fianna Fáil Aisling Dempsey is at 6,535 votes ahead of Linda Murray from Fine Gael who is at 6,164 votes. There will be a battle for the third seat between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael with the transfers of Independent Noel French, who got nearly 4,000 votes, and Ronan Moore of the Social Democrats who received 2,542 votes. Carl O’Brien writes: The Social Democrats want to go into Government if the party can secure commitments on key policy areas, the party’s childcare spokesperson Jennifer Whitmore TD said. The party, which hopes to secure at least 10 seats – up from six in the last election – may have a crucial role to play in Government formation talks. “We have been really clear from the get-go: we want to go into Government, but we’re not going to go in just to make up the numbers,” Ms Whitmore said. “If we go in, it is to make real change and achieve real change.” The party has “five non-negotiables” which it would bring into any Government formation talks. They include 50,000 affordable homes; a public childcare system; the roll-out of Sláintecare; a minister for disabilities; delivering on climate change commitments. “We want to make sure we can deliver,” she said. Ms Whitmore looks set to be reelected with a larger personal vote in Wicklow and is set to take third seat in the four-seat Wicklow constituency, according to tallies. What a battle it’s turning out to be. And a slow one. By this time four years ago, the first constituency in the State, Galway East, had already declared its first count – done at about 3.30pm. We are an hour later than that and still no sign of a first count. We are also getting indications from the tallies that the order of the first three parties may be reversed from last night’s exist polls with indications that Fianna Fáil will finish first, Fine Gael second and Sinn Féin third. That said, they were close last night and they are still very close. I was talking to Pat Leahy last night just after our exit poll was published and he said his sense was the Fianna Fáil vote was perhaps a little understated – and he was right. It’s an intriguing battle. All of the parties will lose a few seats but all will make gains with Fianna Fáil poised to be the biggest party in terms of seats, but not too far ahead of Sinn Féin and Fine Gael. The other big stories. Despite getting close to 4 per cent the Greens could end up losing all their 12 seats, almost a worse calamity than 2011. The Social Democrats has done really well and Labour also look like they will make some gains. And then there is the story that will become a headline not just here but abroad ... the possible election of Gerard Hutch to Dáil Éireann. First count from Fingal West coming in now. No one elected but SF’s Louise O’Reilly topped the poll with 6,965 votes – 565 short of the quota of 7,530. Three candidates including Ben Gilroy have been eliminated and their votes will be distributed now. Labour’s Robert O’Donoghue has 5,044, Fine Gael’s Grace Boland 4,583 and Fianna Fáil’s Lorraine Lee-Clifford 4,417. The Carlow/Kilkenny constituency’s final tally indicates that Fianna Fáil’s John McGuiness is likely to top the poll with just more than 9,000 first preference votes and 14 per cent of the vote. Suzanne Pender reports that McGuinness is followed by his Fianna Fáil running mates Jennifer Murnane O’Connor on 7,541 or 11.8 per cent and Peter “Chap” Cleere 6,660 or 10.4 per cent. Fine Gael’s Catherine Callaghan is next, according to tallies, at 6,223 or 9.7 per cent, followed by Sinn Féin’s Áine Gladney Knox at 6,008 or 9.4 per cent of the vote. The tallies indicate that Fine Gael candidates Michael Doyle is at 4,648 or 7.2 per cent while David Fitzgerald is at 4,359 or 6.8 per cent The Green Party’s Malcolm Noonan looks in real danger of loosing his seat with 2,664 or 4.2 per cent while Sinn Féin, with a second candidate Natasha Newsome Drennan on 5,037 or 7.9 per cent, looks likely to hold the seat vacated by MEP Kathleen Funchion. Tallies appear to show that FF will win two seats but are in with a strong chance of securing a third, FG should hold the seat vacated by John Paul Phelan, while Sinn Féin look set to retain its seat. However, with very little separating the top nine candidates, the transfers of the remaining 11 candidates on the ballot paper will determine a lot. You may have noticed that our seat count currently stands at one, with Fianna Fáil allocated that solitary seat. You haven’t missed any first count completions and no TDs have been elected yet. The one in question is Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl who was automatically elected. We are already running behind the timings of the 2020 general election. Last time out the first seat was filled just after 3pm with Galway East doing the honours. It is now 4:20pm with no TDs elected yet. Tallies indicate that Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty will romp home in Donegal with 19,213 first votes with a quota of 12,959. With 99 per cent of Sligo-Leitrim boxes tallied, TDs Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin and Frank Feighan of Fine Gael are well placed for re-election. Former Fianna Fáil TD Eamon Scanlon has good prospects of returning to the Dáil, writes Arthur Beesley. Independent TD Marian Harkin has not polled well, leaving Independent Ireland candidate Michael Clarke well positioned. However, a strong showing in Sligo town for Chris MacManus of Sinn Féin means he may be in contention for a second party seat as left-wing candidates are eliminated. The 99 per cent tally shows Feighan at 15.8 per cent, although he lacks a running mate for Fine Gael transfers. Kenny is at 13.6 per cent, with Mr MacManus at 9.1 per cent. Mr Scanlon has 10.4 per cent, followed by running mates Edel McSharry at 7.8 per cent and Paddy O’Rourke at 7.2 per cent. Ms Harkin’s vote has dropped to 7.6 per cent, according to this tally, down from 11.5 per cent in the 2020 election. Mr Clarke is at 10.5 per cent. Sinn Féin is potentially on target to secure three seats in the five-seater Cavan-Monaghan constituency for the first time in the party’s history, writes Seanin Graham. The final tally of first preference votes put Sinn Féin poll topper Matt Carthy in first place with 13.55 per cent (9371 votes) followed by party colleague, councillor Cathy Bennett, at 10.03 per cent (6936 votes). Bennett, a theatre manager in Monaghan town, fist-pumped a supporter when tally results appeared on a screen at Cavan Leisure Centre. Fine Fáil’s Brendan Smith – and former incumbent – is in third place with 9.58 per cent (6628) followed closely by Sinn Féin’s Pauline Tully at 9.36 per cent (6478). Fifth place is Fianna Fáil Senator and former Garda Robbie Gallagher. Sinn Féin took a political gamble fielding an unprecedented three candidates in this border constituency and much now depends on transfers. Last time around, Tully was elected on the second count following transfers from her running mate, Carthy. The shock departure of Fine Gael Minister Heather Humphreys – who held a seat since 2011 – has the party pinning its hopes on her protégé, Monaghan councillor and undertaker, David Maxwell. However, Maxwell came sixth, at 8.86 per cent (6129 votes). Good news for our man in Waterford Kevin O’Sullivan as the First count is racing ahead. Based on 54,014 (estimated) total votes the quota expected to be circa 10,742 with 58 per cent turnout. The completed tally has David Cullinane (SF) at 11,835 1st prefs (22.4 per cent) and he is set to be elected on the first count; second and third seats look safe for Senator John Cummins (FG) at 10,203 (19.3 per cent); Mary Butler (FF) at 9,894 (18.7 per cent). The last seat looks like a dogfight between Conor McGuinness (SF) at 5,727 (10.8 per cent) and Matt Shanahan (Ind) at 5,218 (9.9 per cent) but don’t rule out Mary Roche (Soc Dems) at 2,631 (5 per cent). While last seat is probably between McGuinness and Shanahan, Roche is expected to be transfer-friendly among parties of left including Marc O Cathaisagh of the Greens - with 1,635 1st prefs (3.1 per cent). It may not be enough to challenge for last seat and if eliminated her votes are expected to benefit Shanahan. The complete tally for the four seat Clare constituency has Senator Timmy Dooley (FF) comfortably topping the poll in Clare. According to Gordon Deegan, the tally of the 180 boxes has the east Clare senator set to return to the Dail after missing out in 2020 on 11,041 tallied first preferences - or 18.29 per cent of the vote - which will leave him around 900 votes shy of the expected quota of around 12,000 votes. Outgoing deputy, Cathal Crowe (FF) is expected to return to the Dail with 13.69 per cent of the vote in a seat gain for Fianna Fail with 8,264 tallied votes in a strong showing for FF. First time General Election candidate, Cllr Joe Cooney (FG) will secure a seat for Fine Gael while Donna McGettigan (SF) is favourite to secure the fourth seat on 12.44 per cent of the vote. A member of Clare Co Council, Cllr McGettigan lies 2,281 tallied votes ahead of nearest competitor, Leonora Carey (FG) who has 5,228 tallied first preferences. Outgoing Independent TD, Violet Anne Wynne has polled only 286 tallied votes and looks likely to be eliminated after the first count. The former Sinn Fein candidate was the story of the 2020 General Election in Clare when she topped the poll taking 15.11 per cent of the first preference vote. The final tally shows FF with 38 per cent of first preferences with FG having 25 per cent followed by SF on 12 per cent. The first count in Galway West is expected “around tea-time’” and when is tea time in Galway West? Well, John Fallon has been told by one experienced member of the counting staff that itmeans “sometime between five and half-seven”. We’re glad we could clear that up. With tallies now complete in Longford-Westmeath there has been a lot of movement at the top of the leaderboard, writes Stephen Farrell. Peter Burke (FG) has moved into first position, followed by Robert Troy (FF) in second and Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran (Ind) in third. Slipping down to fourth position is Micheál Carrigy (FG), with Sorca Clarke (SF) holding fifth position. Also moving down the rankings is sitting TD, Joe Flaherty (FF) who is almost 1800 first preference votes adrift of Clarke and is certainly in a battle to retain his seat. According to the tallies Burke is on 17.7 per cent of the vote with 10,798 votes, followed by Troy on 8,031 votes (13.2 per cent) and Moran who is on 7,992 votes (13.1 per cent). Carrigy, who was flying high in pole position earlier on, has achieved 6,866 votes (11.3 per cent) and is only 27 votes ahead of Clarke. Apathy amongst people in the urban areas has been an issue. “No matter what the results today there will be a strong Green Party in Ireland,” Eamon Ryan has said this afternoon. “We have deep roots in the community and it’s a very distinct political philosophy and I think there is still space for that in Irish politics, for sure.” Mr Ryan said he did not believe his decision to retire, and the timing of his announcement in June this year, had affected the party’s showing. “Unfortunately – and this is just one of those days – we didn’t get the number of votes,” he said. “We’ll look back and see what are the lessons, and what can we learn and what can we do differently. It’s just one of those days when we didn’t have a good day.” Final tally figures show Fine Gael farmer Willie Aird from Portlaoise set to top the poll in Laois, with over 9,000 first preferences, says Carmel Hayes. Sitting TDS Seán Fleming (FF) and Brian Stanley (Ind) look set to take the remaining posts in the three-seat constituency, with Fleming tallying at 7,923 and Stanley at 6,514. While down on his poll-topping performance for Sinn Féin in 2020, Stanley is well placed to retain the seat as an Independent following his controversial departure from the party in October. Sinn Féin’s new candidate Maria McCormack is doing well on 4,712, according to the final tallies but will require huge transfers to have any hope of outrunning her former party colleague. Is this Michael Healy Rae having his say on social media? https://t.co/RMjrQbivGa pic.twitter.com/0COeAEm0Pj Barry Roche has an update from Cork where returning officer Martin Harvey is predicting they will have a first count in Cork North Central at around 6pm. Looking at the tallies, it doesn’t seem likely anyone is going to be elected on the first count in the five seater. Doing a quick tot on the tallies, some 57,055 people voted in Cork North Central – and doing the math, that should mean a quota around 9,509 – which means even the front runners, Padraig O’Sullivan (FF) and Tommy Gould (SF) on 7,470 and 7,129 are each over 2,000 votes shy. It could be a long night in Cork North Central and Cork South Central is likely to be even longer as Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin is set to comfortably clear the quota, meaning count staff will have to recount his estimated 14,000 plus first preference to distribute his surplus proportionately. It is neck and neck in Cork East with three candidates on 12 per cent according to the final tally, reports Liz Dunphy. First time candidate Mark Stanton will be one of the first elected in Cork East for Fine Gael. The 32-year-old from Midleton looks likely to take the seat from his father, long serving TD and former Minister of State David Stanton who has stepped down. Fianna Fáil’s James O’Connor, who was the youngest TD in the 33rd Dáil, and Sinn Fein’s Pat Buckley, who topped the poll in the last general election, are both also on 12 per cent. Fianna Fail councillor Deridre O’Brien and Fine Gael councillor Noel McCarthy are on 11 per cent. But Social Democrats – and former Green Party councillor - Liam Quaide is also still in the running for a seat, depending on transfers, as is Independent and former Fianna Fáil councillor William O’Leary who are both on 10 per cent. Independent Mary Linehan Foley, former Fianna Fail councillor and county mayor, is on 8% Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are both on 23% of the vote; ‘Others’ which are essentially independents, are on 27%; Sinn Féin is on 13%; and the Social Democrats are on 10%. The Green Party is on 3%. In the four seat constituency, two of the incumbents are not challenging for their seats. Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers is safely on track to secure the Dublin West’s first seat and be elected by 4pm today, writes Sorcha Pollak. It’s expected most of his transfers, numbering around 3,000 votes, will be divided between his running mate Lorna Nolan and Fine Gael’s Emer Currie. Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly is due to clinch the constituency’s second seat on first preferences, while Ms Currie is expected to be elected to the third seat on the second count. Her transfers are forecast to go to the Green Party’s Roderic Gorman who is fighting to secure the 5th seat in the constituency. PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger remains comfortably in fourth place, while Labour’s John Walsh and Aontú's Ellen Troy’s are currently sitting in joint sixth place. It is looking like a good day for the Soc Dems. Deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan indicates that his party is open to talking to arch rivals Labour about government formation pic.twitter.com/O3Akx44j6T Green Party Minister of State Joe O’Brien has acknowledged that he will not be returning to the next Dail, writes Martin Wall. Speaking at the Fingal West count centre in north Dublin the junior minister at Department of Rural and Community Development and at the Department of Social Protection said: “Clearly I have lost my seat anyway. " He said the key issue was the re-drawing of the constituency . The previous five-seat Dublin Fingal has now been broken into two three-seat constituencies, Fingal East and Fingal West. “I lost over half of my base and then the tide was out. The combination of those things was going to make it difficult.” Mr O’Brien said he hoped the Green Party was not wiped out completely. “We are under pressure everywhere but I hope we hold on to a few seats so that the things we got done in the last four and a half years do not slip away in the next Dail.” “We knew going in four or five years ago that there was a strong chance that a bunch of us would lose out seats, which made us extra foused on getting things done. We knew that risk. We had hoped our level of achievement would push that back. Maybe it will. We have to see how things pan out.” Paul Donnelly has said his party should be open to “talking to whomever” when it comes to Government formation, reports Sorcha Pollak The Sinn Féin TD, who topped the poll in 2020 and is on track to secure the second seat in Dublin West, said the constituency’s third, fourth and fifth seats would “go down to a couple of 100 votes”. Once the party has a clearer idea of how many seats it has nationally, then the talks can begin, he said. “I think people should be open to talking to whomever, because it’s about the people. And the people speak in the in the general elections, they give their voice, and it’s up to us to make sure that that voice is heard.” Mr Donnelly said it had been a “tough campaign” but that canvassers had succeeded in convincing people “that there is a different way, and that we can change the way that we run this country, and we can change it in terms of housing, in terms of health and education.” “Across the state, there are opportunities for Sinn Féin, those towards fourth, fifth seats, which we didn’t take the last time. We ran a very important campaign in terms of giving people choice.” In Louth, a 5-seater, it is looking like at least 2 Sinn Féin, 1 Labour so far. Other 2 still too close to call. First count a way off yet in the constituency with the longest ballot in the country (24 candidates). The Social Democrats are set to top the poll in Dublin Bay North based on the tally estimate of 15 per cent of the vote for their housing spokesman Cian O’Callaghan, writes Marie O’Halloran. Sinn Féin TD Denise Mitchell is in a comfortable second place with 14 per cent, down from her whopping 29.8 per cent in 2020 but with a running mate this time around, the party is on 20 per cent. Fianna Fáil’s Tom Brabazon is on 10 per cent of the tally and 18 per cent in total for the party’s two candidates. Fine Gael’s Naoise Ó Muirí is in fourth place on 9 per cent followed jointly by Fianna Fáil’s Deirdre Heney and Fine Gael’s Aoibhinn Tormey, both on 8 per cent. Independent Barry Heneghan and Sinn Féin’s Micheál MacDonncha are both on 6 per cent, while Labour’s Shane Folan and Aontú's James Morris both have 4 per cent of the tally. Green Party candidate David Healy, People Before Profit’s Bernard Mulvany and Independent John Lyons are all on 3 per cent. Early predictions suggest seats for Cian O’Callaghan (SocDem), Denise Mitchell (Sinn Féin), Tom Brabazon (FF) and Naoise Ó Muirí (FG) with a battle for the fifth seat, mainly between Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Independent Barry Heneghan. It looks like a very difficult mountain to climb for Labour’s Shane Folan to keep the seat held by the party’s new MEP Aodhán Ó Riordáin and for Independent John Lyons without phenomenal transfers. Tough day for the outgoing TD. Former Green Party leader Eamon Ryan on a poor election for his party: “It’s been a hard day for us but we’re resilient and we will come back”. pic.twitter.com/wvDXy0ljNi Barry Roche has the latest from Cork. With over 80 per cent of votes in Cork South Central tallied, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin is on course to be elected on the first count with almost 25 per cent of first preference with running mate Seamus McGrath on 8.8 per cent and Sinn Fein’s Donnachadh O’Laoighaire on 11.5 per cent set to follow him home. The final two seats look to be between Padraig Rice of the Social Democrats on 9 per cent and Jerry Buttimer of Fine Gael with Independent Mick Finn on 6.5 per cent and Fine Gael’s Shane O’Callaghan on 6.4 per cent also in with a shout and Labour’s Laura Harmon on 5 per cent still in with a slim chance. Much will depend on Martin’s surplus and where it goes especially in terms of how much goes to the lower placed runners such as Fianna Fail’s Margaret Kenneally, Una McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens which will affect the sequence of their elimination. Their elimination along with that of Sinn Fein’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid and Anna Daley of Aontu will in turn be critical – is there a chance that all five women might transfer in numbers to the likely last remaining woman in the race, Laura Harmon of Labour ? Time will tell. Diarmuid Ferriter’s surgical evisceration of much of our political class is well worth a read. First triumphant video of the day... it won’t be the last. Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly, who is on track to secure the constituency’s second seat, arrives at the Dublin West count centre. Mr Donnelly received 17% of the first preference votes and is set to exceed the quota on the first count. #GeneralElection2024 pic.twitter.com/YshjN6jBiE Now you know. My best piece of Monk trivial is I used to serve him when I worked in a chipper in the inner city. His order was a regular burger with extra onions (€2.60) Senator Martin Conway (FG) says “it is clear now” that first time Fine Gael general election candidate, Cllr Joe Cooney (FG) will secure a seat for Fine Gael in the four seat Clare constituency, reports Gordon Deegan Speaking at the count centre at Treacy’s West County Hotel in Ennis, Senator Conway said that Cllr Cooney’s election campaign “catured the imagination in Clare”. The north Clare based Senator Conway made his general election prediction as the latest tallies give Cllr Cooney 13 per cent of the vote, lying in second overall place in the tallied vote in Clare. In a strong showing for Government party candidates, they have secured 70 per cent of first preference votes in the tally with three FF candidates securing 37 per cent - more than double the 19.5 per cent share of the vote that the party is predicted to receive nationally by the General Election 2024 Exit Poll. Senator Timmy Dooley (FF) remains out front with 20.5 per cent of the vote and will regain the seat he lost in 2020. Sitting TD, Cathal Crowe’s (FF) tallied percentage vote has increased as the tally has continued with now 10.5 per cent of the vote. Sinn Fein candidate, Cllr Donna McGettigan has a strong shout of securing one of the final seats in Clare with the tally showing that the Shannon woman has 10.9 per cent of the vote. Senator Conway said that party colleague Leonora Carey will be in the shake up for the final seat and the sister of retired TD, Joe Carey (FG) has 8.5 per cent of the vote. Michael Lowry is still the clear favourite to top the poll in Tipperary North with 27.3 per cent of the tallies so far, followed by Alan Kelly who has 15.1per cent, according to Neil Michael. The Labour TD had shown a poor start in early tallies, but he has since overtaken Fianna Fail’s Ryan Meara, who is in third place with 13 per cent. In Tipperary South, Mattie McGrath is still topping the poll, with 25 per cent of tallies, followed by Fine Gael’s Michael Murphy, who has 20.8 per cent. While veteran Seamus Healy had a clear chance at a third place earlier in the day, he has since been overtaken by Fianna Fail’s Imelda Goldsboro, who has 13.4 per cent. of tallies, compared to his 11.6 per cent.. Closely behind Mr Healy is Sinn Fein’s outgoing TD Martin Browne, who has 11.4 per cent.. With all boxes tallied in Dublin Bay South it looks increasingly difficult for the Greens to hold former party leader Eamon Ryan’s seat, writes Marie O’Halloran. On the figures Cllr Hazel Chu is in seventh place on 8.3 per cent in the four-seat constituency. Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan looks set to top the poll on 15.3 per cent with his party colleague Emma Blain in fifth on 10.4 per cent. Labour leader Ivana Bacik is in a comfortable second place on 14.4 per cent with Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan on 13.8 per cent and Sinn Féin’s Chris Andrews on 12.1 per cent. Social Democrats Cllr Eoin Hayes has 9.1 per cent of the vote ahead, 0.8 per cent ahead of Ms Chu. Independent and former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell is on 4.4per cent, dashing her dream of returning as a TD for the constituency. With the health warning that it is the tally, not the full count or any transfers included, it looks like Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin will return TDs to Dublni Bay South. The final tally is in for Galway East reports Cian O’Connell and looking nailed on for seats are Albert Dolan (FF) on 19 per cent and Seán Canney (IND) on 18.4 per cent, though neither look set to be elected on the first count, with a quota of around 10,400 votes required. The battle for the two remaining seats in the constituency is difficult to call. Louis O’Hara (SF) is on 13.7 per cent but may struggle for transfers down the line. Anne Rabbitte (FF) has not polled as well as expected on 7.5 per cent but could recover through transfers after her fellow party member’s impressive, poll-topping performance. Pete Roche (FG) on 9.8 per cent is also in the race, polling ahead of FG’s two other candidates Clodagh Higgins on 6.4 per cent and Niamh Madden on 5 per cent. So too is independent Declan Geraghty, who is currently on 9.5 per cent. Labour may well be on course to win a seat in Cork North Central with Mallow based Cllr Eoghan Kenny on 5,63 per cent and breathing down the neck of outgoing PBPS TD Mick Barry who is on 6 per cent with all 160 boxes tallied, reports Barry Roche. Kenny’s running mate, Cllr John Maher from Mayfield is on 4.54 per cent and could leapfrog Kenny but the combined vote of 10.17 per cent means that Labour must favoured to take a seat at the expense of Barry who may benefit whose two candidates will have almost 6 per cent of votes to distribute. Otherwise sitting TDs, Padraig O’Sullivan of Fianna Fail, Tommy Gould of Sinn Fein and Colm Burke of Fine Gael on our course to hold their seat along with Independent Ireland’s Ken O’Flynn who is on 9.82 per cent of first preferences. With just over half of boxes in the Longford Westmeath constituency counted so far the Fianna Fáil vote is down over 10 per cent on the vote the party received in 2020, reports Stephen Farrell. Four years ago Fianna Fáil received almost ten thousand votes but so far have only garnered 3,451 votes. While this has been reflected in the vote that both Fianna Fáil candidates, Westmeath based Robert Troy and Longford based Joe Flaherty, have received, there are also areas where both candidates have polled well. With 55 per cent of votes counted Senator Micheál Carrigy (FG) is in first position with 15.2 per cent of the vote, followed by his party running mate and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Peter Burke who is on 14.7 per cent. In third place is Independent candidate Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran on 12.3 per cent, while sitting TD Joe Flaherty is in fourth on 11.1 per cent and Sorca Clarke (SF), also a sitting TD, is in fifth position on 10.7 per cent. Indications so far are that turnout in the constituency has been disappointing, at 50.2 per cent, with a higher turnout in Westmeath. The Longford town area turnout has registered at just 41 per cent so far, while Ballymahon is registering just over 60 per cent. A third of the way through the tallies in Kerry, Michael Healy-Rae is a clear leader in the five seater single constituency, writes Anne Lucy. He has over 23 per cent of the first preference vote, just under a quarter, according to the tally of first preference votes. After him candidates are bunched - Sinn Féin justice spokesman Pa Daly is at 14 per cent; Education Minister Norma Foley (FF) at just under 13 per cent; and Danny Healy-Rae (Ind) is at 12.2 per cent. The real interest here is on an emerging battle between Fine Gael candidate, former footballer Billy O’Shea and Fianna Fáil councillor Michael Cahill - both are on par at 10.8 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively and are likely to fight for the last seat. The third Fianna Fáíl candidate Linda Gordon-Keller is at just 2.7 per cent. Labour’s Mike Kennedy - the party once held two seats in Kerry, most notable was Dick Spring - is at 2.7 per cent; former Fianna Fail TD and now with Independent Ireland Thomas McEllistrim is at 1.2 per cent and Green candidate Cleo Murphy is at 2.6 per cent, a drop of support for her on her second time out. We have some news in from Donegal courtesy of Stephen Maguire. The Fine Gael vote in Donegal has dropped considerably. Tallying is only halfway through but candidates John McNulty and Nikki Bradley are not tallying well enough to be even considered. Barring a miracle, Donegal will be without a Fine Gael TD for the first time since 1937. The tallies for Dublin South West are in and it is not surprise that veteran Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe is topping the poll, says Ronan McGreevy. He is on 14.8 per cent of the first preference vote, but his vote is half what it was in 2020 when he topped the poll with a 29.72 per cent share and a massive 20,077 first preferences. Dublin South West was one of the constituencies where Sinn Féin could have got a second seat had Crowe a running mate. This time he has one in South Dublin County Councillor Niamh Whelan. She has polled 6 per cent of first preference. Combined though the two Sinn Féin candidates are on 21 per cent of the vote, still well down on 2020. Fine Gael’s Colm Brophy on 12.7 per cent and Fianna Fáil’s John Lahart on 12.4 per cent are expected to be re-elected. The last two seats are between five candidates, Labour’s Cllr Ciaran Ahern on 8.7 per cent, outgoing People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy, who is on 7.6 per cent of the first preferences – an improvement from last time out, Fianna Fáil councillor Teresa Costello who is polling very well at 7.1 per cent, Cllr Sarah Barnes, the daughter of former Fine Gael minister Monica Barnes, who is on 6.6 per cent of the first preference vote and also in the mix is the Social Democrats Ross O’Mullane on 5.8 per cent. The big story in the Dublin South West constituency is the collapse in support for Green Party TD Noel Francis Duffy. He has just 2.9 per cent of the first preference vote. In 2020 he achieved 7.34 per cent. He came to prominence in the election campaign when it was revealed that he objected to a housing development in his constituency of 330 homes because they overlooked his kitchen. He claimed that he was not objecting to the development completely, just the bits that contravened the local development plan. Crowe (SF) - 14.8% Brophy (FG) - 12.7% Lahart (FF) - 12.4% Ahern (LAB) - 8.7% Murphy (PBP-S) - 7.6% Costello (FF) - 7.1% Barnes (FG) - 6.5% Whelan (SF) - 6.0% O’Mullane (SD) - 5.8% Edge (IND) - 5.4% Ní Chónaráin (AON) - 3.8% Holohan (IND) - 3.6% Duffy (GP) - 2.9% Mac Oireachtaigh (NP) - 2.1% Hade (IND) - 0.2% O’Keeffe(IND) - 0.2% Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman says he only expects his party to secure between 2-3 seats in the 2024 general election, down from the 12 TDs currently in Gov. “It's clear the Green Party has not had a good day", he told media at Dublin West count centre. Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman has said “it is clear that the Green Party have not had a good day”. Speaking at lunchtime he acknowledged that it is clear a number of his party colleagues will lose their Dáil seats. “Undoubtedly, it is a disappointing result for our party today,” he told reporters. He said it is “hard for a smaller party in Government” and that has “long been the tradition in Ireland”. Social Democrats outgoing TD Gary Gannon, who is looking good for the third seat in Dublin Central, has said the vote for Gerry Hutch is a reflection of how poorly working class communities have been treated for many years. Speaking on RTE Radio he said that “when people are in a dark place they’ll search for very strange options and that’s what happened here. That’s a plague on all of our houses, it’s a reflection of politics as a whole. “For those of us who actually went into the communities and did the work there’s a little bit of a vindication but I think we’ve all got a job to do. Gannon pointed to the “huge level of media” Gerry Hutch received which he said was “disproportionate”. “He had access to one of the most popular podcasts in the country over the course of three episodes, that makes a huge difference.” With 100 per cent of boxes tallied in Dublin North West, Dessie Ellis looks certain to again top the poll with 17 per cent of the 1st preference vote, writes Olivia Kelly. Unlike last time out he is potentially on track to bring in a running mate with former Dublin city councillor Cathleen Carney Boud on 14 per cent. If two seats go to Sinn Féin in this three-seater, that seems to leave the scrap for the last seat between Fianna Fáil’s sitting TD Paul McAuliffe and newcomer Social Democrats Rory Hearn both, also, on 14 per cent of the first preferences. Former Fine Gael TD Noel Rock, who lost his seat here in 2020 is behind on 12 per cent. Conor Reddy of People Before Profit/Solidarity who almost got a seat last time out taking the lion’s share of Ellis’s transfers is on 9 per cent, and is likely to suffer from the appearance of Carney Boud on the ballot paper. Independent Gavin Pepper is on 6 per cent, followed by Aontu’s Edward MacManus and Independent Stephen Redmond both on 4 per cent. Former Green Party Lord Mayor Caroline Conroy is on 3 per cent, with Centre Party Ian Croft and Independent Diarmuid Mac Dubhghlais both on 1 per cent. Early tallies in Cavan-Monaghan has Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy nailed on with 20 per cent of the vote. writes Seanin Graham. Almost half of the 260 boxes have been opened and in second place is Fianna Fáil’s Niamh Smyth followed by Fine Gael’s David Maxwell, Aontú's Sarah O’Reilly and Fianna Fáil’s Robbie Gallager. One Sinn Féin source said he is confident that the party’s Pauline Tully will retain a second seat for the party – and possibly gain a third in the republican border county constituency. “We’re going to fasten down two – and it’s too early to dismiss the chance of a third seat,” he said. Last month’s shock departure of Fine Gael minister Heather Humphreys – who held a seat since 2011 - led Sinn Féin to field a late candidate, councillor Cathy Bennett, a theatre manager in Monaghan town. Ossian Smyth is among the senior Green Party figures looking to be in real trouble after all of the boxes were opened in Dún Laoghaire and the tallies completed, reports Emmet Malone. Smyth, a Minister of State in the current government, is reckoned to on just 7.5 per cent, roughly half the first preference vote of Barry Ward who some had seen as potentially a rival for the constituency’s fourth seat. Ward is on 14.9 per cent and should benefit from Jennifer Carroll MacNeill’s projected first count surplus of about 1,000 votes. Another one who was regarded as possibly being destined for the fourth seat dogfight was Cormac Devlin of Fianna Fáil but he has polled well, with the tallies putting him on 15.8 per cent, high enough to ease the party’s concerns about where he might get transfers. As it is, party sources believe he is picking up a healthy number of Fine Gael second preferences in some areas and there would be an expected boost when Aontú Mairéad Tóibín is eliminated. Richie Boyd Barrett is on 12.3 per cent but would be expected to do well from Sinn Féin transfers in the event Shane O’Neill is eliminated but Smyth’s route back from the brink is unclear. He looks to have stayed ahead of Social Democrat, Hugo Mills, but only just and he needs an awful lot of transfers from him and Labour’s Martha Fanning to have a chance of surviving. Cork South West may prove to be a bastion of political stability with all three incumbents looking very likely to retain their seats, according to current tallies with 66 per cent of boxes now open in Mallow GAA grounds, reports Liz Dunphy. Independent Ireland leader Micheal Collins is currently in the lead with 25 per cent of the vote followed by Social Democrat leader Holly Cairns, who gave birth to a baby girl on polling day yesterday. Ms Cairns is in second place to take a seat according to current tallies on 20.1 per cent of the vote. Fianna Fail’s TD Christopher O’Sullivan is coming in to take the third and last seat with 19.2 per cent of the vote according to current tallies. But Fine Gael, between its two candidates Senator Tim Lombard on 9 per cent of the vote and Noel O’Donovan on 12.9 per cent of the vote are currently the county’s leading party with 22 per cent of the total vote, sounding some caution for Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Cairns as these candidates will most likely transfer votes in later rounds to each other. With all boxes now opened and tallied in Dublin Rathdown, Green Party minister Catherine Martin could be in danger of losing her seat, according to Jack White. Fine Gael, meanwhile, look set to retain their two seats, despite Josepha Madigan’s retirement from politics. Minister of State Neale Richmond leads the tally results with 20 per cent, followed by Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell (13 per cent). Fianna Fáil councillor Shay Brennan ended at 12 per cent in the cross-party tally, while independent councillor Michael Fleming and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney find themselves at 9 per cent. Although minimally behind Ms Gibney, the Green Party’s Catherine Martin faces losing her seat at 8 per cent. Sinn Féin’s Shaun Tracey ended at 7 per cent, while former Fine Gael minister and now-independent candidate Alan Shatter ended at 4 per cent, according to the tally results, which noted a turnout of 59 per cent. It appears that Green Party TD Francis Noel Duffy will lose his seat in Dublin South West, writes Ronan McGreevy. The husband of Government minister Catherine Martin has just 2.8 per cent of the vote in the constituency with 82 per cent of the tallies done. He came to prominence in the election campaign when it emerged that he objected to 330 homes in his own constituency which he claimed was overlooking his home. He claimed the development overlooked his kitchen. This is a pretty sobering tweet for the Green Party. If, as looks possible, Greens lose all their Dáil seats, it’s a salutary warning to Labour and Social Dems who will come under fierce pressure to go into government with FF and FG. The Greens did a lot better in this last government than they did previously but to no avail #GE24 All boxes are open in Dublin West and Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly are set to secure the first two seats, reports Sorcha Pollak. With 100 per cent of boxes tallied, Mr Chambers had secured 22 per cent of first preference votes (9,396 votes) followed by Mr Donnelly with 17 per cent of votes (7,631). The estimated quota for the constituency based on the opening of all boxes is 7,281. In a solid third place is Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie who is on track to secure the third vote in the constituency, with 15 per cent of first preference votes (6,663). PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger remains on eight per cent while Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman is holding onto a marginal lead of seven per cent to secure the fifth seat in this constituency. Labour’s John Walsh and Aontú's Ellen Troy’s are holding a joint six per cent of first preference votes. About 57.1 per cent of Dublin West registered voters cast a ballot in this general election, closely mirror national turnout of 56.35 per cent. “It’s really scary at this stage, just watching the boxes being opened,” Cork North West Fianna Fáil TD Aindrias Moynihan on the tally at Mallow GAA #GE24 ⁦@irishexaminer⁩ pic.twitter.com/CjMI8k3Di3 Ireland First leader Derek Blighe, who is running in Cork North Central, expects Independent Ireland’s Ken O’Flynn to be the main beneficiary when he is eliminated from the poll after polling, according to tallies, approximately 4 per cent of first preferences “I’m happy with how I’m doing so far – I canvassed all over, I did Mallow, I did the northside of the city, Glanmire, Watergrasshill, Glenville, Carrignavar, Whitechurch – I’m only just in but I got a decent amount of support in Mallow and a decent amount of support on the Northside. “The way it’s looking at the moment, I’m not going to make it – I would imagine a lot of votes will go to Ken O’Flynn, some might go to Sinn Fein – after that, I don’t know,” Blighe told The Irish Times at the Nemo Rangers Count Centre in Cork. Pat Leahy has a moment in time assessment of the state of play. In the four-seat Cork East constituency with 25 per cent of the boxes open Fianna Fáil’s Deirdre O’Brien is the early front runner on 13.6 per. cent followed closely by Sinn Féin’s Pat Buckley and independent Mary Linehan Foley both on 11 per cent, writes David Forsythe. Also in the mix are Noel McCarthy (FG) and James O’Connor (FF) both on 10 per cent of the vote. Independent Willie O’Leary, Social Democrats Liam Quaide and Mark Stanton of Fine Gael are all on 9 per cent. With more than a third of boxes open at the Waterford Count, it is clear five candidates are in a battle for four seats, with Sinn Fein led by David Cullinane topping the poll by a decisive margin – and Green Party outgoing TD Marc O Cathasigh unlikely to retain his seat, reports Kevin O’Sullivan. The tallies indicate that if Sinn Fein transfers strongly with Cullinane, based in Waterford City having a big surplus, Cllr Conor McGuinness based in Dungarvan could take a second seat for the party. He is also polling strongly in western parts of the constituency. By mid-morning, Cullinane has 28 per cent of the vote with Sinn Fein at 36 per cent, while outgoing Fianna Fail TD Mary Butler had 17 per cent of the vote and is likely to be re-elected. With 18 per cent of the vote, Senator John Cummins is expected to win back a Fine Gael seat lost in 2020. Its expected outgoing independent TD Matt Shanahan (10.7 per cent) will be in a battle with McGuinness for the final seat. Labour’s Sadhbh O’Neill was at 2.8 per cent and Mary Roche of the Social Democrats at 6 per cent. The sorting of votes is now well underway in Mallow GAA ground where ballots from the three Cork county constituencies are being counted, writes Liz Dunphy Fianna Fáil TD Aindrias Moynihan said that initial tallies show “a lot of uncertainty” regarding the retention of his seat. “It’s all up in the air. It’s really scary at this stage, just watching those boxes being opened,” he said. “I’ve seen a few snapshots and it’s really tight at this stage.” “Everything” for him is riding on winning a seat, he said. The three constituencies being counted in Mallow are the four seat constituency of Cork East and the three seat constituencies of Cork North West and Cork South West. As expected, with roughly two thirds of boxes tallied in Galway East, outgoing independent TD Seán Canney looks set to comfortably retain his seat having so far accumulated 25 per cent of first preference votes. writes Cian O’Connell. Minister of State Anne Rabbitte (7 per cent) is facing a battle, with fellow Fianna Fáil candidate Albert Dolan (15 per cent) in a strong position. Mr Dolan looks likely to take the second of four seats in the constituency. Fine Gael’s Pete Roche (10 per cent) is currently outperforming his party’s other candidates Niamh Madden (5.5 per cent) and Clodagh Higgins (5.7 per cent). It is still early days, but Mr Roche should benefit from transfers down the line to claim a seat. Sinn Féin’s Louis O’Hara (13 per cent), who narrowly missed out on a shock win in 2020, has started positively. A strong showing in Tuam augurs well for the Athenry native, though he may struggle to compete with rival candidates on transfers. Votes from Athenry are among those yet to be counted, where Mr O’Hara will be hoping for another boost. We have some updated tallies in. First up is Martin Wall. The chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party Alan Farrell is in a battle to retain his seat in the new constituency of Fingal East. Tally figures suggest that Farrell is slightly behind Ann Graves of Sinn Féin. With all boxes open in Fingal East, tally figures suggested that Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is set to top and poll. Tally figures indicate that O’Brien has received about 23 per cent of the first preference votes. According to the tally figures Farrell is running about 65 votes behind Graves who narrowly lost out on a seat in the local elections earlier this year. Just slightly ahead is out-going TD Duncan Smith of the Labour Party. Tally figures suggest that Graves is on 14.6 per cent, Smith on 14.5 per cent and Farrell on 14.4 per cent. Mick Wallace, who entered the race late on, looks to be out of the running in Wexford. KILDARE SOUTH It's very early doors, but former Sinn Féin TD Patricia Ryan looks to be in serious trouble. With 18pc of boxes tallied, Ryan is polling at less that 1pc. Ryan resigned from Sinn Féin in October 2024.#ge24 @irishtimes Outgoing Minister for Justice Helen McEntee is topping the polls in the Meath East constituency, according to early tallies. Shauna Bowers reports that a total of 25 of 127 boxes have been tallied to date, meaning there are health warnings attached to the indications. McEntee, Fianna Fáil’s Thomas Byrne and Sinn Féin’s Darren O’Rourke are the incumbents in the constituency. The boxes opened to date would geographically favour Ms McEntee and Mr Byrne. As it stands, McEntee has 21 per cent of votes, followed by Byrne at 13 per cent, and O’Rourke close by at 12 per cent. The Sinn Féin candidate was the first elected in the area in the 2020 election. The constituency has seen the number of seats it holds upgraded to four from three, with a number of candidates currently neck and neck to claim the final seat. Both Sinn Féin’s Maria White and Fine Gael’s Sharon Tolan currently stand at 9 per cent, while Fianna Fáil’s Caroline O’Reilly is at 7 per cent. Aontú's Emer Tóibín, the sister of party leader Peadar Tóibín, is at 6 per cent. In total, Fine Gael currently has 29 per cent of votes, followed by Sinn Féin at 22 per cent and Fianna Fáil at 19 per cent. Early days, but here are those leading the tallies for Louth so far, with 26% tallied: Joanna Byrne (SF) 15.30%Ged Nash (LAB) 12.25%Ruairí Ó Murchu (SF) 11.08%Erin McGreehan (FF) 8.98%Paula Butterly (FG) 8.72%Alison Comyn (FF) 8.09%#Election2024 Gino Kenny of People Before Profit looks set for a rollercoaster battle to keep his seat in Dublin Mid West, writes Kitty Holland. With almost all 126 boxes tallied in this five-seat constituency, Sinn Féin’s two TDs here, Eoin Ó Broin and Mark Ward, are powering ahead on 21.4 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively. Fine Gael’s Emer Higgins is close behind on 9.5 per cent, with Fianna Fáil’s Shane Moynihan on 9.1 per cent. It looks like a battle royale for the fifth seat, between Francis Timmons (Labour) on 5.2 per cent; Eoin Ó Broin (Social Democrats) 6.1 per cent; Gino Kenny on 5.6 per cent and Paul Gogarty (Independent) 6.9 per cent. It appears Kenny’s vote has been squeezed by both the Social Democrats and his neighbour in Clondalkin Glen Moore, running for the Irish Freedom Party, who is on 3.3 per cent. And we have more in from Dublin West where Roderic O’Gorman is in trouble, reports Sorcha Pollak. Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly were leading the charge by 11am with 58 per cent of boxes open. Fianna Fáil deputy leader Jack Chambers is currently at 21 per cent, followed by Mr Donnelly at 19 per cent. Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie is at 13 per cent, PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is at 8 per cent with Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman and Labour’s John Walsh Green Party both holding 6 per cent. With a population of 138,547, Dublin West is one of the fastest growing constituencies in the country and has five seats up for grabs in this general election. All the boxes in Dublin Central have now been opened. The tally figures have Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald at 20 per cent, Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe at 17 per cent, Social Democrats Gary Gannon at 13 per cent, Independent Gerard Hutch at 9 per cent, Labour’s Marie Sherlock at 7 per cent, Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick at 7 per cent, Green’s Neasa Hourigan at 6 per cent and Independent Malachy Steenson at 5 per cent. Janice Boylan (SF) and Clare Daly (Ind) and Eoghan Ó Ceannabhain (PBP) all at 4 per cent Sinn Féin is on track for 40-plus seats, Martin Kenny has told Arthur Beesley in Sligo The TD pointed to a “little swing” in the last two days of the campaign which could see the party increasing its Dáil presence from 37. Mr Kenny is on course for a smooth re-election in Sligo-Leitrim, with running mate Chris MacManus in the hunt for a second party seat. “We felt a little swing in the last couple of days. We could feel it coming along. Certainly in the last week the difference was there. We could see it building,” he said in the count centre after tallying Sligo boxes. “We’re going to get probably over the 40 seats nationally – and how many over that, it could be down to transfers for the last seat in a lot of the constituencies. So we’re happy enough from that perspective from what we were last June in a poor enough local election.” The chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party Alan Farrell is facing a battle to retain his seat in Fingal East, writes Martin Wall. With more 80 per cent of boxes now open, tally figures suggest he is neck and neck with Ann Graves of Sinn Féin. Each have just more than 14 per cent. Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien seems set to top the poll. Former Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley, who controversially left the party in October, is polling strongly across the county according to early tallies, as he bids to regain a seat as an Independent. Early indications are that Willie Aird (FG) and Minister of State Seán Fleming (FF) are also performing well. Elaine Mullally (Ind), Maria McCormack (SF) and former FG councillor Aisling Moran (Ind) are also pulling in votes from across the three-seat constituency. Minister of State Ossian Smyth facing a battle to retain his seat in Dún Laoghaire with the Green Party candidate on just over 7.5 per cent, reports Emmet Malone. Fine Gael on about 34 per cent combined with party sources saying Blackrock and Wyvern boxes currently being opened having the potential to boost that slightly. Jennifer Caroll MacNeill currently on course to be elected on first count and they feel if Ward can add a percentage point or two to his 12.7 per cent he would be in a. good position to take the fourth seat. The Taoiseach Simon Harris is on course to top the poll in Wicklow while Fianna Fáil Minister for Health is facing a battle to retain his seat, writes Carl O’Brien. Based on just over a quarter of boxes tallied, Mr Harris is in first place (28 per cent), followed by Sinn Féin’s John Brady (15 per cent) and Social Democrats’ Jennifer Whitmore in third (14 per cent). There looks to be a battle for the final seat in the four-seater constituency between Fine Gael’s Edward Timmins in fourth (6.8 per cent) and Fianna Fáil’s Stephen Donnelly (6.6 per cent) in fifth. Joe Behan (Ind) is further behind (4 per cent), followed by sitting Green Party TD Steven Matthews (3.6 per cent), who looks set to lose his seat on what looks like a miserable day for party. Former Fine Gael minister and retiring TD Richard Bruton has expressed his disappointment with media coverage of the election campaign, writes Marie O’Halloran. “I think the headline in one of the newspapers saying Fine Gael was in free fall was a little bit inaccurate to say the least,” he said. The outgoing Dublin Bay North TD said what he saw was “the blowing up of very small errors to dominate the campaign. And whether that is fair or reflective of the issues, I have my doubts.” Mr Bruton said “I think traditional media sort of followed the social media line of the sensational over the substance. “That’s what I felt disappointing about the election- the media coverage was just instantaneous click bait coverage.” On the outcome in Dublin Bay North Mr Bruton said it was still early days but it looked like a seat for Fine Gael, Social Democrats, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin with a fight for the fifth seat. He said Denise Smith’s party colleague Cllr Micheál MacDonncha is contention for a second Sinn Féin seat. He is in a battle with Independent Barry Heneghan for the last seat while Labour faces a difficulty in holding on to the seat formerly held by MEP Aodhán Ó Riordáin with Independent John Lyons “not doing as well as people might have hoped for him”. At 9am the Limerick count centre was told that the city count would go ahead despite candidates not appearing in alphabetical order on the ballot paper, writes David Raleigh. As it currently stands, 29 of 137 boxes have been tallied & is showing that three outgoing TDs Willie O’Dea, (FF) is on 20 per cent Kieran O’Donnell (FG) is on 14 per cent and Maurice Quinlivan (SF) is on 12 per cent. On the face of it outgoing Green TD Brian Leddin is struggling on 5 per cent.

With 87 per cent of boxes open in Fingal West, tally figures suggest Green Party Minister of State Joe O’Brien is struggling to retain his seat. Tallies indicate he is on 6.5 per cent in the three-seat constituency. Is Gerard Hutch in with a shout of a seat? With three quarters of the boxes in Dublin Central open, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald is at 21 per cent, reports Sarah Burns. She is followed by Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe at 13 per cent. Independent Gerard Hutch and Social Democrats Gary Gannon are both at 12 per cent. Oh and we have our first wedding ring. It was found in a ballot box in Athlone. With nearly two thirds of boxes tallied in Fingal West, Robert O’Donoghue of the Labour Party seems well in the hunt for a seat, writes Martin Wall. Louise O’Reilly of Sinn Féin is leading on 23.1 per cent of tallies, with O’Donoghue on 18.2 per cent. Grace Boland of Fine Gael is on 15.1 per cent and Lorraine Clifford Lee of Fianna Fáil on 12.4 per cent There are three seats in the new Fingal West constituency. Simon Harris on course to top the poll in Wicklow.Donnelly in trouble? @irishtimes #GE2024 pic.twitter.com/5PMUL2cJzE Early tallies in Wicklow based on 10% of boxes opened show Taoiseach Simon Harris in first place (27%), followed by SF’s John Brady (15%), Social Democrat Jennifer Whitmore (14%), FG Edward Timmins (10%) FF Stephen Donnelly (6%) and Green’s Steven Matthews (3%). @irishtimes #ge24 pic.twitter.com/yNFRTJk2Ze It is very early days but Roderic O’Gorman, the Green Party leader might be in trouble in Dublin West – or at the very least he will be in a fight for the last seat. Fianna Fáil’s Stephen Donnelly, the outgoing Minister for Health might also be in a dogfight in Wicklow. A pretty bleak, early assessment from a Green Party stalwart. Suspect today will be a tough day for @greenparty_ie. @rtenews exit polls traditionally over-estimate Green vote-share, and bar 2019/2020 we almost always rely on strong second preferences to get across the line. My hunch is 3 seats #GE2024 Tally from Dublin West with 25% of boxes open - SF Paul Donnelly at 21%, FF's Jack Chambers is at 20%, FG Emer Currie is at 14%, PBP-Solidarty's Ruth Coppinger has 9% and GP Roderic O'Gorman and SD Ellen Murphy are on joint 6%. As part of the exit poll, people were also asked about what they mainly used to help them form their opinion before voting, reports Cormac McQuinn. Twenty-five per cent of respondents said it was TV programmes while the next highest figure, 13 per cent said social media or online messaging. Eleven per cent said online news sites like irishtimes.com, rte.ie or thejournal.ie while another 11 per cent said national radio and a further 11 per cent said local radio. National printed newspapers stood at 4 per cent and local newspapers were on 2 per cent. Podcasts were also on 2 per cent while 18 per cent of respondents said “something else” helped them to form their opinion before voting. According to the exit poll social media was the main form of media helping form the opinions of 18 to 24-year-old voters with 37 per cent of respondents in the age category reporting this. This compares to just 2 per cent among the over 65s and 6 per cent in the 50 to 64 age categories for whom TV programmes were the main response to this question. The poll, which is a joint project of The Irish Times, RTÉ, TG4 and the Political Science Department of Trinity College Dublin, was conducted by Ipsos B&A among 5018 voters as they left 253 polling stations across all 43 constituencies yesterday. Meanwhile, voters were also asked about the trustworthiness of politicians, writes Corman McQuinn. A total of 53 per cent said their view is most politicians are trustworthy. More men (56 per cent) than women (51 per cent) were of this opinion. Forty-five per cent of the respondents said most politicians are untrustworthy. The highest level of trust in politicians was to be found among Green Party supporters with 78 per cent of these saying most politicians are trustworthy. The same answer was given by 73 per cent of Fine Gael voters and 66 per cent of Fianna Fáil supporters. In terms of those who expressed the view that most politicians are untrustworthy, 68 per cent of Aontú voters responded in this way as did 67 per cent of Sinn Féin supporters. More than half of voters, 53 per cent, made up their minds on who they would cast their ballot for in during the election campaign, according to the exit poll. The decision of almost a third came n the last couple of days or on polling day itself. The results demonstrate the importance of the campaign period in Irish elections with many voters yet to make their final decision in the weeks leading up to polling day. The results mirror the 2020 exit poll when 52 per cent of people made up their minds over the course of the campaign.

It’s a fair question for sure give the exit poll and the likely outcome of the election but there won’t be many people under the age of 50 who have any idea what he is talking about. Potentially very interesting story coming out of Dublin West, writes Sorcha Pollak. With 12 per cent of the boxes open FF’s Jack Chambers and SF’s Paul Donnelly are steaming ahead. Chambers is on 22 per cent and Donnelly is on 21 per cent. FG Senator Emer Currie is on 12 per cent, PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is on 9 per cent and Independent candidate Tania Doyle is coming in fifth position at 7 per cent. Leader of the Green Party Roderic O’Gorman is trailing in eighth position with 4 per cent. But – and we can’t stress this enough – it is early days so all the health warnings apply.

Tallies predicting in Dublin Bay South that James Geoghegan will top the poll with Labour’s Ivana Bacik in second. Jim O’Callaghan of Fianna Fáil in third with transfers of Social Democrats Cllr Eoin Hayes determining the fourth seat. He is transferring to Ms Bacik and the Greens’s Cllr Hazel Chu. Labour tallyman Kevin Humphreys predicts a tight contest between Sinn Féin’s Chris Andrews and Ms Chu but that Sinn Féin should hold on. It could be that Fine Gael’s Emma Blaine will lose out. Considerable disquiet in Galway West that tally people were not allowed in before the boxes were opened at 9am, writes John Fallon. Former FF Minister Frank Fahey said it’s the first time he has experienced that and fears that it might impact on tally figures. News from Dublin Bay South – two seats for FF looking unlikely although the usual health warnings apply. Dublin Bay South Geoghegan to top the pole, no two seats for FG #GE24 Former Social Democrats leader Róisín Shortall said the party is “certainly very encouraged by the 5.8 per cent” in Friday’s exit poll, writes Marie O’Halloran. “It’s really good and it’s almost double what we had in the last election,” she said. Arriving at the RDS, Ms Shortall said “if that holds up in terms of the actual votes today, we would be very happy and we should certainly make gains”. She declined to put an estimate on those gains. “It’s just there’s so many variables in constituencies. It’s just very hard to predict but we’re very happy with that kind of starting point. almost 6 per cent. It’s great.” News (very, very early news) in from Dublin Central.

Very early tallies @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/HkNpRWxEmO The political parties, Independents and others are attempting to co-operate on the tallies at the RDS for Dublin counts,” writes Marie O’Halloran. Not the easiest thing in the world however as “everyone has different views on how to do it” says one tally man. The efforts follow hit and miss tallies in the local elections. The ballot boxes are now being opened at the counting has started. We should start getting first round results in the early afternoon. Peadar Tóibín of Aontú was very upbeat and said his party could get up to 4 per cent and might be contention for as many as four seats. “We’re growing and we’ve passed out People Before Profit, Independent Ireland and if the votes go the way I think they’re going we may even pass out the Green Party.” He said a key “objective was State funding. We’ve done all of this growth without State funding and it looks like we’re going to reach the threshold for State funding ” Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit has also been on radio and he pointed to the “historic decline” of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. He said there combined vote would be around 40 per cent, down 3 per cent on 20 years ago. He suggested that two years ago there was “a big momentum behind the idea of a left of centre alternative ... and then it faltered.” Fianna Fáil’s director of elections Jack Chambers has said the election is “too close to call”. Speaking on RTE’s Morning Ireland he denied that there was no difference between his party and Fine Gael and as a result little alternative for voters “We ran different campaigns with different priorities and very much a different platform.” He said the “real story” was the Sinn Féin vote. ' A year or two they were in the mid 30s they’re now back around 20 per cent.” The Green Party’s director of elections Pauline O’Reilly has said that while she doesn’t want to “count chickens before they’ve hatched” she believes the party will be returning to the Dáil with some seats. “It’s only a question now of how many,” she told Morning Ireland. “We benefit from preferences down the line and across the board [and] it’s the preferences down the line that are going to determine this.” Housing and homelessness was the most important issue for 28 per cent of people when deciding how to vote followed by the cost of living on 19 per cent and health on 17 per cent. According to the exit poll, economic stability was on 9 per cent), climate change on 4 per cent and, crime, local transport and roads and childcare all on 2 per cent, writes Pat Leahy Immigration – which had been prominent in the list of issues of public concern for much of the year – played a minor role, nominated by just 6 per cent. The housing issue was more prominent among younger voters with 42 per cent of those under 34 nominating it as the most important issue. We have an update on the exit poll from our Political Editor Pat Leahy that points to what voters may want to happen next. Almost half of voters in yesterday’s general election favour a coalition government based on the combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, according to the Irish Times/RTÉ/TG4/TCD exit poll. Nearly a third of voters (31 per cent) said they would prefer a coalition of just Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil; a further 9 per cent preferred a government of those two parties plus independents; while a further 9 per cent said they would like to see a government of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and one or more smaller parties. Combined, this is a total of 49 per cent of voters in the exit poll who want to see a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil-led government. The next most popular choice is a government led by Sinn Féin without Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, which was chosen by 22 per cent. Another 7 per cent said they wanted to see a Fianna Fáil-Sinn Féin coalition (including just 9 per cent of Fianna Fáil voters), while 21 per cent said they wanted to see “something else”. The most popular choice for Taoiseach is the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who was the preferred choice of 35 per cent. He pips the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who is on 34 per cent, while the Fine Gael leader Simon Harris is on 27 per cent. Just 5 per cent gave no response. So, how is the day and the weekend going to pan out? The ballot boxes will be opened at the count centres around the country at 9am after which the ballot papers will be sifted and sorted. By 11am some decent tallies will start coming in that should give us an even better sense of where things are going than the exit polls did. By mid to late afternoon we will have the first seats filled and the counting will continue across the country late into the night. It will start all over again on Sunday morning and by midnight tomorrow we should be done. The people have spoken, now we just have to figure out what they said, as the old saying has it. The exit poll we published last night put the three main parties clustered at around 20 per cent and – based on those figures – the next Government will be made up of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and others. But as keen election watchers will well know a lot can change as the votes are counted and the seats get filled. So, we’ll start – unusually, perhaps – by quoting a Letter to the Editor published this morning from Paul Delaney in Delgany. “It’s all over bar the counting: the excuses, the recriminations, the finger-pointing, and the inevitable lengthy political horse-trading that takes place before the establishment of a coalition government. The people have spoken; but it’s going to take quite a while to figure out what exactly they said. ” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Nvidia's AI audio model, Claude's new features, and funding for AI agents: This week's AI launches

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. Nvidia (NVDA) announced its new AI audio model, Fugatto, this week that can generate or transform “any mix of music, voices and sounds described with prompts using any combination of text and audio files.” Fugatto is short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1, Nvidia said. With the new model, users can enter a text prompt and generate a music snippet, remove or add instruments to an already existing song, change accents or emotions in a voice, and “produce sounds never heard before.” “Fugatto is the first foundational generative AI model that showcases emergent properties — capabilities that arise from the interaction of its various trained abilities — and the ability to combine free-form instructions,” Nvidia said. Anthropic announced new updates to its Claude AI chatbot this week. With the new Google (GOOGL) Docs integration, Claude can use context from a user’s documents to improve the relevance and accuracy of its responses, Anthropic said. Claude can summarize long documents and “reference historical context” from Google Docs files. The integration is available for Claude Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. Claude’s new styles feature allows users to customize how the chatbot responds to follow a preferred communication style and work requirements. Users can choose a formal, concise, or explanatory style. Claude can also generate custom styles from uploaded sample content. Anthropic also added the ability to add global profile preferences for the chatbot to instruct it “on things you always want it to keep in mind,” such as a preferred coding language. AI agents startup /dev/agents came out of stealth mode this week and announced a $56 million seed round. The funding round was co-led by Index Ventures and CapitalG. The startup, which is building an operating system for AI agents, was founded by former Stripe chief technology officer David Singleton, and former vice presidents at Google and Meta (META): Hugo Barra, Ficus Kirkpatrick, and Nicholas Jitkoff. “Today you can build an AI demo in hours, but getting something consumers can actually trust with their credit card is nearly impossible,” Singleton said. “Just as Android made mobile development accessible to virtually any developer, we’re building the platform that will help make AI agents mainstream.” Runway announced its new base model for image generation, Frames, this week. The new model represents “a big step forward in stylistic control and visual fidelity,” the AI startup, which develops multimodal AI systems for video, image, and audio generation, said. Frames can maintain stylistic consistency when generating images, Runway said. Access to Frames is rolling out in its Gen-3 Alpha foundation model and through Runway’s API. Visual AI platform Luma launched its first image generation model, Luma AI Photon Image Model, this week. The text-to-image foundation model was built on Luma’s Universal Transformer architecture. The model is 800% faster and cheaper than other models, Luma said. Luma also announced a free and subscription-based service for its Dream Machine visual AI service on the web and iOS. The Dream Machine model was released in June and has 25 million registered users.

Title: Investing.com stocks of the week

Investing.com -- Despite the quieter back half of the week due to the Thanksgiving holiday, there was still plenty of action in the markets, with several names capturing investor attention. Here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week: Symbotic (SYM), Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Rocket Lab USA (RKLB). Symbotic shares plunged over 37% on Wednesday after the company announced it would not meet the deadline for filing its annual form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024. It cited the need to evaluate the financial impact of a significant error in its revenue recognition. The company disclosed that the error, related to cost overruns that are not billable on certain deployments, has impacted its system revenue calculations and financial results for the year. While analysts at TD Cowen maintained a Buy rating on the stock, saying the “reaction [is] likely overdone,” DA Davidson, Craig-Hallum, and KeyBanc cut the stock to Hold/Neutral following the news. Rivian made solid gains this week. On Monday, its stock closed over 13% higher after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it had reached a "conditional" settlement in its 2020 lawsuit accusing Rivian of employee poaching to steal electric-vehicle trade secrets. While Tesla did not reveal the details of the agreement, it is said to have told a California state judge that it plans to dismiss the case by December 24, provided the settlement terms are fulfilled. Rivian also announced on Monday that it had received a conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion to accelerate its growth of electric vehicle design, development, and manufacturing in the United States. Reacting to that news, analysts at Truist stated: “We view the announcement as an incremental positive for the RIVN story providing another avenue for capital alongside the Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) (VOW-GR, NR) JV, however given the timeline of the project with Phase 1 not expected to begin production until 2028, we expect the focus to remain on R2 startup at Georgia for the time being.” Rocket Lab USA shares continued to surge this week, gaining more than 18% (at the time of writing on Friday). It is currently trading around the $27.32 mark after gaining around 6.4% on Friday. The week started well for the company, with its stock jumping on the back of news it received a $23.9 million award from the U.S. Department of Commerce and completed two successful satellite launches within 24 hours. The funding, awarded under the CHIPS and Science Act, is expected to support Rocket Lab's efforts to expand compound semiconductor manufacturing at its Albuquerque, New Mexico facility. Meanwhile, the company hit a new operational milestone, successfully conducting two launches within a 24-hour period. The first was launched from its facility in Virginia, followed shortly by the “Ice AIS Baby” mission from New Zealand. This second mission placed five satellites into low Earth orbit for Kinéis, a French operator developing an Internet-of-Things satellite constellation. KeyBanc raised its target for RKLB to $27 from $12 per share, maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock.

We recently published a list of the 10 Best Canadian Stocks to Buy Under $10. In this article, we are going to take a look at why Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN) is one of the best Canadian stocks to buy under $10. The Canadian stock market had a positive third quarter, following a sluggish start earlier in 2024. The market was driven by domestic rate cuts and rebounding global markets. The BMO S&P 500 Index ETF, iShares Core S&P/TSX Capped Composite Index ETF, and iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index ET have surged over 33%, 20%, and 22% year-to-date, as of November 27. If we talk about year-over-year headline inflation, it has cooled as per the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2%. Hence, policymakers have cut rates four times consecutively and another 50 basis points cut is expected in December. The Bank of Canada’s benchmark lending rate stands at 3.75%, while economists are projecting a terminal interest rate of as low as 2%. The managing director and head of macro strategy at Desjardins Group pointed out that the GST tax break from December 14 to February 15, 2025, will have a high fiscal multiplier, adding a noticeable boost to growth in the first half of 2025. The tax break is to increase consumer spending which has been severely impacted by interest rate increases and high debt levels since 2022. The tax break will allow consumers to buy essentials such as groceries, snacks, and kids’ clothing – all tax-free. In the long run, the potential trade tariffs pose a wider threat to companies. The newly elected U.S. President Trump has vowed to impose a 25% tax on imports from Canada as well as Mexico. In 2023, the U.S. accounted for more than 75% of exports from Canada.

(NYSE:DNN) ranks among the best Canadian stocks to buy under $10. A close-up of a uranium mining site, the hardworking miners working underground to extract uranium resources. Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 23 Share Price as of November 27: $2.30 Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN) is a uranium exploration and development company with its main operations in the Athabasca Basin region of northern Saskatchewan, Canada. The company holds a 95% interest in the Wheeler River Project, which is its flagship uranium project. Denison Mines also owns a 22.5% ownership interest in the McClean Lake joint venture, which operates several uranium deposits and the McClean Lake uranium mill. The McClean Lake Mill has an annual licensed production capacity of 24 million pounds of uranium annually. Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN) has innovative in-situ recovery (ISR) mining techniques, allowing the firm to reduce environmental impact while ensuring efficient uranium extraction. The company’s In Situ Leach (ISL) method is one of the cost-effective methods of uranium mining. This mining method involves dissolving the uranium minerals in place without physically removing the ore from the ground, thus minimising its cost. Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN) is one of the largest Uranium mining companies in Canada. The U.S.’s highest uranium import was from Canada in 2023. Moreover, the U.S. has banned uranium imports from Russia, which makes the U.S. find an alternate route for uranium supply. This could be a catalyst for Denison Mines in the coming quarters, however, potential trade tariffs can be a threat to exports. In addition, Denison Mines is creating three uranium exploration joint ventures with Cosa Resources in the eastern part of the Athabasca Basin, northern Saskatchewan. Denison Mines Corp. (NYSE:DNN) will maintain a minimum 30% direct interest in the properties and become Cosa’s largest shareholder. In Q3, DNN was held by 23 hedge funds with stakes worth $88.09 million. Point72 Asset Management is the largest shareholder in the company with a stake worth $17.58 million. Overall, DNN ranks 7th on our list of the best Canadian stocks to buy under $10. While we acknowledge the potential of DNN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: ‘Superhero stuff’: There’s only one Cian Healy
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/11/30/superhero-stuff-theres-only-one-cian-healy/
Time Published: 2024-11-30T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
As a force of nature, as someone out of the ordinary, Cian Healy was building a reputation long before he even won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup medal with Belvedere College, never mind before he cut his teeth with Leinster and Ireland. Eoin O’Malley was a team-mate on that exceptional Belvo team that in 2005 bridged a 33-year gap by lifting the Cup for the first time since Ollie Campbell captained them in 1972. He had first encountered Healy on opposing mini-rugby teams – O’Malley with Belvedere and Healy with Clontarf. “He was already like this mythical character. People talked about this fellow ‘Cian Healy’ and you can imagine what a giant he was when you’re playing against him at under-10s or whatever,” O’Malley recalled this week, still sounding as much in awe of the child prodigy now as he was then. “He was like a man against boys, and all the stories were going around about him, like pushing his dad’s car up a beach, and he had sandbags at the bottom of the stairs in the house and he’d lift them whenever he was going up and down. It was like superhero stuff hearing about him. “Some of the stories probably grew legs but they’re probably better that way. As a kid, you were running a mile away from him.” Much to the relief of O’Malley and others on the Belvo minis, they would become team-mates at school from the age of 12. “Without really meaning to, he was just on such a different trajectory from day one,” says O’Malley. “Physically he was exceptional but ambition-wise he always talked big. He wasn’t the loudest person but in quietly going about his business, he set a big tone with the group the whole time” Healy, his friends since childhood Paul O’Donohoe, O’Malley and Ian Keatley, were all part of the Belvedere team that surprised a Blackrock team featuring Luke Fitzgerald, Ian Madigan, Niall Morris, Vas Artemiev and Dave Moore by 16-10 in the final. Healy drew a line in the sand when running through Artemiev early on. O’Malley was forced to retire at the age of 25 and admits he fell out of love with the game after two years of ultimately fruitless rehabbing. But on the day Healy is set to become Ireland’s most capped player of all time, O’Malley was planning to travel from Portugal, where he lives with his wife Lara and their three kids Bobby (six), Odette (five) and Lucia (two). O’Malley describes Healy as a shy character and innately very giving, someone who would do anything for his close-knit circle of Clontarf friends and team-mates. “He really has a heart of gold,” says O’Malley, recalling a big freeze 10 years or so ago when Healy offered to drive to the rescue of all and sundry in his jeep. “You can talk about the rugby side of things all day and people see that, but they obviously don’t know him on that level. “If I ask him about a young front-rower coming through he jumps into his protective skin. It’s a new role for him in recent years, like a mentor or big brother, and he enjoys it, and they all seem to have huge respect him.” While dedicated to his profession, Healy has always had an ability not to take rugby too seriously. “He always has an outlet of creativity, whether it’s art or graffiti, or coffee or knife-making,” says O’Malley. “Some are quite obscure, but he always seems to master them. I don’t know what it is, but he has an ability to focus in on a skill and master it.” Healy was always a keen painter and O’Malley recalls him presenting his brother Brian and wife Nina with “an amazing painting that he did himself” from their wedding day. “He’s his own unique character and doesn’t become too pressurised by things, which I think is kind of unique in that world.” Indeed, there is most definitely only one Cian Healy. “He is an exceptional physical specimen,” said Joe Schmidt this week. “A bit like Andrew Porter, both those guys you have to lock them out of the gym as best you can, otherwise they will just become behemoths. One of the things with Cian is that he is so agile. He was so dynamic as a young man when I first got to Leinster. “Probably a memorable moment, we were playing Clermont in a European semi-final to make the final against Ulster and it was in Bordeaux, in France. Clermont were at the height of their powers. We played a set play with Isaac Boss going around the back, the pass from Richardt Strauss going to Rob Kearney; there’s Cian on his shoulder trying to overtake him! “He is that sort of athlete. He was lethal close to the line. The opposition couldn’t stop him, and we couldn’t get the ball off him. He would just grab it, roll his sleeves up and do the work. There are a few others [memories] but I’ll leave those. He can put them in his book.” He is also Leinster’s most capped player and his debut away to Border Reivers way back in May 2007 is the stuff of folklore inside the squad, even in a 31-0 defeat. “He absolutely tore it up,” recalls Jamie Heaslip. “At the video review on the Monday morning we all thought what the f*** is this prop doing?” Of course, Healy has changed as a player and person over 20 years. Heaslip, his long-time friend and roommate with both Leinster and Ireland for a decade, says Healy is deriving additional pleasure from sharing some special moments with his two sons, Beau and Russell, and his wife Laura. His sister Adrienne and parents Don and Caroline, who have attended nearly every one of the 350-plus games Healy has played in his career, will all be in the Aviva on Saturday. Healy and Heaslip are godfathers to one of the other’s children, and Heaslip saw Healy as something of a generational player, who redefined the role of a prop. “Athletically he was as quick as most backs over that first 10 or 20 metres,” said Heaslip. “His explosiveness is insane. You see him in the gym, the metrics he would be doing, his jump scores, his strength, all that, insane power through contact. “Then he had pretty good footwork for a big man. You get the ball to Cian 5m from the line? Good luck trying to stop him,” says Heaslip of a prop who has scored 12 tries for Ireland and 32 for Leinster. “He was a bit of a free spirit and that was embraced in [Michael] Cheika’s environment. We came from different backgrounds and weren’t all out-and-out rugby heads.” When Healy first broke into the team he was into art and rollerblading, and has developed passions for coffee, knife-making and being a DJ among other things, as well as his dogs, Hank (a German Shepherd) and Ted (a pug), and is also, according to Heaslip, “an unbelievable man on the barbecue”. But all the while, what a player, and what a roll of honour. There have been five Six Nations titles, including two Grand Slams, as well as four Champions Cups, one European Challenge Cup and seven Pro12/14/URC titles, plus that Leinster Schools Senior Cup. On the Wednesday in camp before the Argentinian Test, when Healy would equal O’Driscoll’s record, Andy Farrell hosted an internal tribute night for him, which included a host of personalised video messages. “He deserved all the plaudits he got, because although he’ll have hated it,” says Heaslip, laughing, “he deserved every bit of it, and if he doesn’t go back into rugby after playing, you probably won’t see a lot of him, He’ll follow his other passions and spend time with the kids and doing the family thing. Such is the guy.” Healy’s physical and mental resilience have also been tested to the limits by injuries that might have finished other men, the badly damaged ankle at the outset of the Lions tour in Perth in 2013, the nerve damage following an operation on a disc that severely threatened to end his career and, cruelly again, the knee injury in Ireland’s last World Cup warm-up match against Samoa in Bayonne. Yet he turned his hand to tight head and even as a hooker again. But for this, and Ireland retaining 15 players after both Dan Sheehan and Ronan Kelleher were injured by the 48th minute in Murrayfield, Ireland would probably not have won the Grand Slam two seasons ago. “It’s a game that grinds you down and you’ve got to be on top of all the stuff that people don’t see, in the training grounds but at home as well,” says Heaslip. “He has his own gym at home, a cold pool, a sauna, his recovery boots – he’s all over it 24/7 – as well as being a very hands-on dad in latter years.” And assuming that role as prop mentor is typical of Healy. “That’s testimony to the guy. Loyalty is a big thing to him and being part of something and helping others out. He’s a soft soul but his emotional intelligence is really high. He has an acute sense of what’s the right thing to do for people and the group.” Healy is also good fun to be around and on a night out, even if there’s been less of those in latter years and, accordingly, he is a very popular team-mate. “He’s seen it all, from Leinster pre-success to being part of it, a bit of a lull, success again. He’s one of those guys, like Mal [O’Kelly] was to me, where people will be saying 10 years from now: ‘Oh, I played with Cian Healy’.” Heaslip adds: “He loves rugby, but rugby doesn’t define him. When all is said and done, I hope he stays involved in rugby. I think he’d be an excellent scrummaging coach, similar to John Fogarty. “But at the same time it wouldn’t surprise me if Cian goes: ‘Ah, that was great and now on to life after rugby’ and does whatever he does.” Ireland: 133 caps (currently joint highest with Brian O’Driscoll and 10th highest in world rugby). Debut v Australia, Croke Park, November 2009, 20-20 draw). Leinster: 282 appearances (a record). Debut v Border Reivers, May 2007. Champions Cup appearances: 112 (a record). 5 Six Nations titles, including two Grand Slams – 2014, 2015, 2018 (Grand Slam), 2023 (Grand Slam), 2024. 4 Champions Cups – (2008-09, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2017-18). 1 Challenge Cup – (2012-13). 7 Pro12/14/URC titles – (2007-08, 2012-13, 2013-14, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21).

Title: Drinking Fluoridated Water Can Cause More Than 130 Different Health Problems, Peer-Reviewed Science Shows | WLT Report

GreenMedInfo‘s Sayer Ji is calling for an immediate end to all water fluoridation across the United States based on a trove of science he has compiled to show that fluoridated water is highly toxic. Article by Ethan Huff, republished with permission from Naturalnews.com A quick search for the term “fluoride” in the GreenMedInfo science archives pulls up 136 diseases that exposure to fluoridated water can inflict on humans. The first and most referenced health condition caused by fluoride is general fluoride toxicity, which can manifest with a variety of symptoms. One of them is lowered or impaired intelligence quotient (IQ) – fluoride makes people dumb, in other words. Dental fluorosis is another common problem linked to fluoridated water. If you have ever seen someone whose teeth are stained with off-colored spots mixed in with their normal tooth color, that is dental fluorosis. What you are seeing, in fact, is damage to the teeth caused by fluoride chemicals rotting out the enamel, which is ironic considering the claim that drinking water must be fluoridated to protect people’s teeth from decay. “End the outdated practice of fluoridation NOW,” Ji (@sayerjigmi) tweeted alongside a link to GreenMedInfo‘s fluoride science archive. (Related: A New Zealand court recently ruled that even the new lower-level 0.7 mg/L dose of fluoride in drinking water is dangerous, presenting an “unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.”) Prenatal exposure to fluoride is also a problem, according to science. Expectant mothers who are exposed to it have an increased risk of bearing children with fluoride toxicity, which includes things like learning disorders, cognitive damage and behavioral problems. Prolonged exposure to fluoride is also linked to infertility in both males and females. Chronic inflammation is part of the cause of this, science shows, with fluoride causing testicular injury in males. Neurodevelopmental disorders can manifest due to exposure to fluoride, as can dental plaque and caries. In older people, neurodegenerative diseases can also manifest due to fluoride exposure. There is also the DNA damage component, goiter, bone fractures, coronary artery ecstasia, osteoarthritis, pancreatic diseases, sleeping disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, spleen damage, hypertension, arterial calcification, lead poisoning, bone diseases, diabetes, pineal gland calcification and iodine deficiency. All sorts of metabolic diseases have been scientifically tied to fluoride exposure, as have cardiovascular conditions like strokes and heart attacks. Chronic kidney disease is another possible health effect of fluoride exposure, as are: • Brain inflammation • Chronic kidney disease (CKD) • Dysbiosis • Ovarian diseases • Anxiety • Cardiomyopathy • Depression • Heart failure • Autism spectrum disorders • Heavy metal toxicity • Premature aging • Low testosterone • Atherosclerosis • Autoimmune diseases • Colitis • Dementia • Estrogen deficiency • Gastrointestinal inflammation • Mineral deficiencies • Obesity • Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) This is just a sampling, by the way, of the many health problems that fluoride exposure can cause. Take some time to look through the GreenMedInfo fluoride science archive to learn more about why you and your family would do best to avoid fluoridated water at all costs. “Adding fluoride to water increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disease in children and reduces their IQ,” warns Joseph A. Ladapo, MD, PhD, Florida’s surgeon general. “We can strengthen teeth without consuming this neurotoxin. The data are consistent, adding fluoride to our communities’ water must stop,” Ladapo added, linking to this guidance for community water fluoridation in the Sunshine State. The medical establishment, including X / Twitter veterans who only believe “the science” as the government defines it, is freaking out that Ladapo, Ji, and many others are speaking out against artificial water fluoridation, which most of the rest of the world rejects as pseudoscience. Artificial water fluoridation is forced drugging by the government. Learn more at Fluoride.news.

RFK, Jr.: “On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water!” This is a true BOMBSHELL if I've ever heard one! Rack up another one for the tin foil hat conspiracy theorists? We sure do seem to be having a lot of "conspiracy theories" coming true all of a sudden, don't we? Despite dentists trying to convince us that we absolutely have to pump fluoride into our water and load it into our toothpaste, the truth is finally coming out! I am really coming to love RFK, Jr. more and more because this is the bombshell announcement he just dropped about finally stopping the poisoning of American citizens with fluoride: On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water. Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President… — Robert F. Kennedy Jr (@RobertKennedyJr) November 2, 2024 Folks.....THIS. IS. HUGE!!!! You know those Dateline episodes where the wife slowly poisons the husband with small amounts of toxic chemicals every day and eventually they build up in his system and kill him? The woman is the US Government, the chemical is fluoride, and you're the slowly dying husband. They insist fluoride is super safe and good for you, except when you have an industrial spill of it, the fluoride eats through concrete and they have to send Hazmat teams in to clean it up! But....."we promise it's really good for you just in smaller doses." Yeah, we're not buying that anymore: Two more videos you need to see.... First: The US government was recently forced to release a suppressed May 2022 report on the effects of fluoride on kids. The report concluded fluoride can cause neurological damage in children. 🤬🤬🤬 pic.twitter.com/Uvn04vbwgf — 🌹 (@Btchen_n) August 22, 2024 Second: FLUORIDE HAS BEEN FOUND DAMAGING TO THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH WHY ARE THEY STILL USING IT? pic.twitter.com/nLP0AI6FS5 — DR.

Make America Healthy Again! It's no coincidence this just happened a few weeks ago: Several US Towns Suspend Using Fluoride In Water Supply After Federal Judge Ruling I am also proud to have recently published this next report.... Once again, you can trust us to be AHEAD of the news here at WLT Report: Is It Time For A Nationwide Ban On FLUORIDATED Water? Do community leaders reserve the right to mass medicate every person in their community using the water supply as a vector? What if that medicine was eventually exposed as a POISON decades later? What if that POISON was damaging the brains of children and stunting the cognitive development of the next generation? Article by Lance D. Johnson, republished with permission from Naturalnews.com Since 1945, municipal water supplies have been mass medicated (poisoned) by hydrofluorosilicic acid (fluoride). A byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry, fluoride is captured by industrial scrubbers, and then barreled up and sold unrefined to communities across the country. Today, around 72.7% of U.S. communities are subject to this toxic chemical. But with new evidence coming out against fluoride, is it time for a nationwide ban on fluoridated water? In a landmark decision, a federal court recently ruled that water fluoridation at the current levels poses an “unreasonable risk” to children, markedly reducing IQ and harming their cognitive development. The ruling, issued on September 24, requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take regulatory action in response to the lawsuit filed by the Fluoride Action Network and several other organizations. Back in January 2011, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced plans to lower the recommended fluoride level in drinking water, citing a rise in dental fluorosis cases among children. This condition, caused by excessive fluoride exposure, prompted federal agencies to put limits on fluoride levels in water. In 2015, federal guidelines were finally revised, establishing 0.7 parts per million (ppm) as the standard fluoride level for community water systems. However, according to The National Toxicology Program, even this level of .7 ppm causes health problems in children, harming their cognitive development and lowering their IQ in a dose dependent manner. So why regulate this chemical at all, if the most scientifically-appropriate public health measure is a complete ban on fluoride? Rick North, a former advocate for fluoridation shared his transformative experience after reviewing a 2006 report by the National Academy of Sciences. “I always thought fluoridation was fine,” North said, reflecting on his past beliefs. “But the science contradicted the statements from fluoridation promoters.” Since that turning point, North has dedicated himself to opposing fluoridation, serving as a board member of the Fluoride Action Network. The lawsuit, initiated in 2017, faced numerous delays, as the EPA tried to postpone proceedings to protect the reputations of those who had promoted fluoride for decades. A key moment in the case came with the release of a report from the National Toxicology Program, which indicated a link between fluoride exposure and reduced IQ in children. This report played a crucial role in the judge’s decision, as North noted, “The evidence was compelling.” However, North pointed out that economic interests and professional reputations have played a significant role in the continuation of this practice. The EPA currently has 60 days to respond to the court ruling, but the implications of this decision may resonate far beyond that timeline. As communities weigh the risks associated with fluoridation, the conversation around public health, scientific evidence and regulatory oversight is likely to intensify in the coming months and years. Following the ruling, communities across the U.S. have begun to reevaluate their fluoridation practices. Cities such as Abilene, Texas, and Yorktown, New York, have paused or stopped fluoridation, a move that highlights local autonomy in public health decisions. North emphasized that many communities do not need to wait for the EPA's response, stating, “It’s their decision to fluoridate or not.” While this is true, citizens across the United States should not have to wait for their community officials to weigh the evidence and consider their reputations. If making America healthy again is going to be a serious political movement, then water purity should be top priority. Political leaders should be informing the public that they are being poisoned by fluoride, while petitioning Congress to ban water fluoridation across the United States to protect the welfare of the people.

This may be one of the most important articles I've published in a while... Let me explain why. I'll start at the beginning and I think you'll really get it by the time I hit the end. Ok, so why do we even care about BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street in the first place? And who are they? They are the three largest Asset Managers in the world. Essentially, and this is no exaggeration, they are the people pulling the strings in the background. These are the "Masters of the Universe". Larry Fink runs BlackRock and he is almost certainly more powerful than the President of the United States. That's not an exaggeration, and I'll explain to you why in just a minute. First, let's start here with something called the "Illusion of Choice". Take a look at the image below.... You THINK there are all of these different brands to choose from out there, but they are really owned by TEN big corporations. That's true in food: And it's also true in Media. Same exact thing.... You think there are a bunch of Newspapers, TV channels, radio stations, websites -- but in 2011, SIX corporations controlled 90% of it all. Ok, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Because as bad as that is, here's the part most people don't tell you. It's actually way worse than that because there's another whole layer on the pyramid at the very top that they never tell you about. In fact, I bet most people reading this have never heard of BlackRock, Vanguard or State Street -- or if you've heard about them you probably don't know exactly what they do. Or if you DO know exactly what they do, I bet you may never have realized why it's a giant problem. So let me explain it to you in real simple terms, and I think it will make a lot of sense. Most people are paid every two weeks, usually on a Friday. And most people have been coached to put 6% of their salary into their 401k and/or some other amount up to the employer match. Great, right? Well, here's what's actually happening. Most of those funds go into ETFs and other investment vehicles managed by, you guessed it, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. So they've built a system where millions upon millions of dollars are flowing in to them via YOUR 401k's every two weeks. You bust your butt at work and get a paycheck and you've been coached to give 6% of that check to these "Big 3". The Big 3 then get bigger and bigger and bigger every Friday! What a great system, right? For them it is. And what are you told about it? Almost nothing. In fact, what do they tell you? When you start your job, they tell you to set up your 401k auto-donation and then "forget about it". Isn't that what they say? Don't even think about it! The money will be there for you when you turn 65, but don't think about it until then. And DEFINITELY don't ask who's managing it or what they're doing with it. My friend Patrick Bet-David has been all over this, breaking the story wide open. He was on Joe Rogan last week and he dropped this bombshell.... You think those charts above are bad? That's not even the worst of it. Of the TEN food corporations and SIX media corporations, the control and ownership is actually way more centralized than that. Remember all that money coming in every Friday from YOUR paychecks? That goes to the Big 3, and they use it to own all of those companies. So it's not even the Big 10 Food Companies or the Big 6 Media companies....it's just the Big 3. And of the Big 3 it's really mostly the Big 2. Many believe the Big 2 may eventually take over State Street. For those who like stats, here's the stat for you: 88% of the companies in the S&P 500 has one of the Big 3 as that company's biggest shareholder. PBD breaks it all down here: So...why do I tell you all of that? Because when you centralize ownership and control, bad things start to happen. What starts to happen is the Big 3 and their "affiliates" create things like ESG and DEI scores. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance and it's a score they give to companies to "keep them in line." So is DEI, which stands for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Don't follow enough Far-Left "social" trends -- not promoting enough Trans agenda or LGBTQ agenda or Climate Change agenda (i.e. Bud Light, Target, etc.)? Then your score takes a huge hit! That really explains a lot, doesn't it? Because I can't tell you how many conversations I've been in with people who say: this stuff doesn't make any sense! Why are these companies doing this? Why would Bud Light TANK their company? They know it's not going to play well to the people who buy their beer? THAT. DOESN'T. MAKE. SENSE! And you'd be right to say that, but only if you assume Bud Light is trying to please the people who buy its products. What if Bud Light had a higher master? What if Bud Light was more concerned with its ESG score? What if all the Executives at Bud Light knew that if their ESG score dropped too low, then their #1 Shareholder (the Big 3) would fire them and replace them with someone who would be "ESG Friendly"? What if you're pulling in a total comp package as a top exec in the $20 million range and your choice is to push the Far Left agenda and push LGBTQ or know that you'll be fired and replaced in a year by the Big 3? What do you do? NOW what decision would you make? Now is it suddenly making a lot more sense? And there you have it. Now I think you get it. Now suddenly every single corporation turning their logo to the Rainbow Flag in June suddenly makes a lot of sense. Once again, here is my friend PBD explaining ESG in much more detail: Now let's recap... Do you see how insidious this is? A big chunk of YOUR paycheck goes to prop up the Big 3 every single Friday, they get bigger and stronger, they use that money to buy all the major corporations in the world, and then they force them to do things you would NEVER support. Sick, right? Now let me bring this in for a landing... And here's why I'm telling you about this. Because we don't just report the news here and then say "good luck"! No, we give you solutions! Now back to my Mission and my solution. I figured I would eventually need to build a Parallel-Economy from the ground up. I knew that would be a ton of work. So it was on my back-burner. In fact, it had been there on my back-burner since about 2016. Until suddenly, in January of 2023, I connected with a company I had never heard of before....but they're MASSIVE. They've been in business for over 35 years and they're a VERY pro-American, pro-Liberty, pro-Conservative values company! They're an American based, Made-In-America, warehoused-in-America, shipped-from-America company! In fact, they're the last private, family-owned, pro-American consumer goods company left in America NOT owned by those 11 companies I showed you above. Oh, and what if I told you the products are BETTER and often CHEAPER than what you get from those 11 companies above? Yes, for real. And their founder was once placed on Barack Hussein Obama's list of the Top 10 most "Dangerous Conservatives" in America? (a list I one day hope to make myself!) Once I learned all of that, I knew I no longer had to build this from the ground-up by myself, I simply needed to partner with this awesome company to help them get the word out. So on top of being the last Family-owned major consumer goods manufacturer not part of the Big-11, comparable or often lower prices, supporting American jobs and families, here's the part that ties in to the main point of this article". Non-toxic products! Here's a quick summary of this company that I'm so excited to now be partnered up with on this mission: Sound good to anyone else? Me too! The reason you've never heard of them is because it's Invite Only. I can get you in, but you can't just go sign up. They only want people on the same mission to join and they're happy to say "no" to the Far-Left Libs! They've been doing it for 37 years and it's been working great. Oh, and did I mention the products are non-toxic and don't have all the chemicals and crap like Red Dye 40 that all the Big Corporations put in their products to weaken you? To wear you down? To make you -- and your family -- sick? Because then when you get sick you'll buy their drugs! Sorry folks, I don't play that game and neither does my family. We're talking the LAST all natural, grass fed, no hormone, massive Black Angus beef cattle ranch in the United States.... Sound good? We're talking Fluoride Free Toothpaste, chemical free cleaners, Deet-free mosquito repellant! What novel concepts, right? Stop sending you money to these 11 corporations that do NOT have your best interest at heart: It's an ILLUSION of choice. There's only one pro-American, American made and manufactured, chemical free, toxin free, hormone free, company left....and I'm teaming up with them to FIGHT BACK! Who's with me? Watch this: As I said, it's Invite Only and the invite is completely free! In fact, I've assembled a team of patriots who will personally get you invited and signed up....if you want in. It's called "Patriot Switch" and I think the name says it all. Folks, we don't have many strongholds left. This is one. And I'm all in.

Title: The BLUETTI Handsfree 2 is a solar backpack and power station — It’s $249 off

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? While you’re busy shopping through all of the Best Cyber Monday deals, here’s a little something that might pique your interest. You’ll be even more excited if you spend a lot of time outdoors or off-grid. You might want to wait on grabbing that Cyber Monday portable power station deal. Allow me to explain. The BLUETTI Handsfree 2 is a backpack, like any other outdoor pack you might encounter, except for one thing. It’s also a power station and solar generator. Believe me when I say this thing is insane and super useful. But for Cyber Monday, there’s a deal that includes the BLUETTI Handsfree 2 and a 100-watt solar panel to charge it on the go. Normally $799, it’s yours for just $599, saving you $200. Wow. You have to read what it can all do, so don’t leave just yet. At first glance, it looks like any regular outdoor or hiking backpack. It has a lot of functions that would serve you well on the trail or while camping, too. For example, there are MOLLE hangable points to hang your sleeping bag, tent, or solar panels. It has a travel essentials zone for stowing shoes, clothing, medicine, and necessities. It has a photography gear zone for lenses, cameras, and even drones. It also has the much-needed, power station zone where the power station tech is stored. Like any other power station, the integrated one can be charged via solar, auto ports, AC outlets, and generators. The solar panel that comes with it can plug right into the station, and then hang from your backpack while you travel. That entire time it powers up the station inside. The entire pack is IPX4 splash-resistant and has load-bearing belts, back panel support, waist pads, waist belts, shoulder straps, and chest straps. So, basically, it’s super comfortable and supportive everywhere it needs to be. It’s also large enough to carry everything you need for the day while you’re out hiking or camping. While all of that is incredible. What’s truly exciting to me is the Cyber Monday price. Maybe I’m alone here but saving $200 on something like this is awesome. Normally $799, it’s yours for $599. I have no idea how long this deal is going to last but I’m going to shop it myself I think. When I get my hands on one I’ll let you know what I think, but if I were you, I wouldn’t wait around for that info. The deal will be long gone by then. If the past two sultry summers taught us one thing, it’s that we never want to be without power -- for air conditioning, other appliances, and devices -- especially when we need it most. That in itself is a great reason to browse these generator deals. And right now at Amazon, you can score $150 off this Jackery Portable Power Station Explorer 500 Outdoor Solar Generator. It’s down to only $500, and then there’s a coupon to get an extra $50 off its original price of $600. Never be without power again with this amazing deal. We’ve all been there: Suddenly, the lights and Wi-Fi go out, the TV goes off, and you’re powerless to do anything. Blackouts are a fact of life, but you never need to be without power again with the Portable Power Station Explorer 500 Outdoor Solar Generator from Jackery. It can not only provide important power during blackouts, but it’s incredibly helpful for camping trips and any outdoor activities far from a power source. This is a household essential that you can’t do without, and at this price, there’s no reason not to grab it. A “20% off sitewide” banner on top of a company’s website should normally be cause for glee among customers. Except if you’re a fan of that company’s products and its executives remain silent amid mounting signs that said company might be on the brink of bankruptcy.That’s what’s happening with Juiced Bikes, the San Diego-based maker of e-bikes.According to numerous customer reports, Juiced Bikes has completely stopped responding to customer inquiries for some time, while its website is out of stock on all products. There are also numerous testimonies of layoffs at the company.Even more worrying signs are also piling up: The company’s assets, including its existing inventory of products, is appearing as listed for sale on an auction website used by companies that go out of business.In addition, a court case has been filed in New York against parent company Juiced Inc. and Juiced Bike founder Tora Harris, according to Trellis, a state trial court legal research platform.Founded in 2009 by Harris, a U.S. high-jump Olympian, Juiced Bikes was one of the early pioneers of the direct-to-consumer e-bike brands in the U.S. market.The company’s e-bikes developed a loyal fandom through the years. Last year, Digital Trends named the Juiced Bikes Scorpion X2 as the best moped-style e-bike for 2023, citing its versatility, rich feature set, and performance.The company has so far stayed silent amid all the reports. But should its bankruptcy be confirmed, it could legitimately be attributed to the post-pandemic whiplash experienced by the e-bike industry over the past few years. The Covid-19 pandemic had led to a huge spike in demand for e-bikes just as supply chains became heavily constrained. This led to a ramp-up of e-bike production to match the high demand. But when consumer demand dropped after the pandemic, e-bike makers were left with large stock surpluses.The good news is that the downturn phase might soon be over just as the industry is experiencing a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to a report by Houlihan Lokey.This may mean that even if Juiced Bikes is indeed going under, the brand and its products might find a buyer and show up again on streets and trails. If you've been on the internet and seen a bunch of pressure washer clips and are now considering grabbing one yourself, you'll be happy to know that there is a huge range of them to pick from. That includes some great budget-oriented versions to dip your toe in and are still good for cleaning stains and cleaning up stuff. That's why we've gone out and collected some of our favorite washer deals for you below, including some of the best pressure washers for cars, which you do have to be a bit careful with not to strip the paint or clearcoat. Greenworks Pressure Washer Combo Kit -- $110 $220 50% off While this Greenworks power washer doesn't have as high a PSI, around 1,900 PSI, it is a lot more portable and a great option if you want something that's smaller and easier to take around with you. It comes with a 35-foot power chord and a 20-foot hose, so you get quite a bit of distance. If you are somewhere rural and need to clean stuff that doesn't have a power cable nearby, this is perfect. Besides that, we also appreciate that this comes with an 11-inch surface cleaner, which isn't something common with a lot of other power washers, even more expensive ones. Just be aware that you do need a My Best Buy subscription to be able to get the discount.

Title: This KIWI design Meta Quest 3 and 3S accessory adds 2.5 hours to your playtime

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Two of the biggest gripes I have with my family’s new Meta Quest 3S — if you can really call them that — can be solved in one go, with a pretty useful accessory. First, the stock head strap is uncomfortable and I wish the battery life were just a little better. Well, KIWI Design has a Meta Quest 3 and 3S accessory that fixes both of those quirks. The K4 Boost comfort strap also includes a built-in battery that adds an extra 2.5 hours of playtime. It’s more comfortable to wear, too. But here’s the best part: It’s only $40 in a Cyber Monday deal. Normally $70, that saves you $30. And don’t fret if you think you missed out on the best Cyber Monday deals, many of them are still available to shop, like this one. The KIWI Design K4 Boost is both a comfort-oriented strap and a battery life extender thanks to a built-in battery. You get an extra 2.5 to 3 hours of wireless playtime while it’s charged. Moreover, it supports dual fast charging so both the battery and the Quest unit charge with minimal delays. One of the more useful features of this headstrap is the adjustment system. You can easily take the Meta Quest 3 or 3S off, readjust the strap, and put it back on. That also goes for swapping players, which can be a tad frustrating when you’re using the stock strap. That’s because on the KIWI straps you use a rear-mounted dial that’s as simple as twisting a knob. You put the headset on, twist the knob to tighten the strap and that’s it. It’s super simple and you’ll be amazed at how fast and how well it works. I was too. You don’t have to worry about the strap adding too much weight to the whole setup either. Even with the battery, it’s relatively light at 0.8 pounds. That still gives you plenty of maneuverability while wearing the headset. Anything that would bog down the set and your head would make moving around more difficult. That’s certainly not the case here. Plus, a little added weight is a decent trade-off for more playtime. I’ve noticed during use that my family burns through the battery pretty fast, especially while playing some Beat Saber. For Cyber Monday, the price of the KIWI Design K4 Boost headset is now $40, normally $70. That’s a great offer on a fantastic Meta Quest 3 and 3s accessory. Connections is one of the best puzzle games from the New York Times. The game tasks you with categorizing a pool of 16 words into four secret (for now) groups by figuring out how the words relate to each other. The puzzle resets every night at midnight and each new puzzle has a varying degree of difficulty. Just like Wordle, you can keep track of your winning streak and compare your scores with friends. Some days are trickier than others — just like other NYT Games favorites The Mini and Strands. If you're having a little trouble solving today's puzzle, check out our Connections tips and tricks guide for some good strategies or check out the hints for today's Connections puzzle below. And if you still can't get it, we'll tell you today's answers at the very end. How to play Connections Strands is a brand new daily puzzle from the New York Times. A trickier take on the classic word search, you'll need a keen eye to solve this puzzle. Like Wordle, Connections, and the Mini Crossword, Strands can be a bit difficult to solve some days. There's no shame in needing a little help from time to time. If you're stuck and need to know the answers to today's Strands puzzle, check out the solved puzzle below. How to play Strands You start every Strands puzzle with the goal of finding the "theme words" hidden in the grid of letters. Manipulate letters by dragging or tapping to craft words; double-tap the final letter to confirm. If you find the correct word, the letters will be highlighted blue and will no longer be selectable. Love crossword puzzles but don't have all day to sit and solve a full-sized puzzle in your daily newspaper? That's what The Mini is for! A bite-sized version of the New York Times' well-known crossword puzzle, The Mini is a quick and easy way to test your crossword skills daily in a lot less time (the average puzzle takes most players just over a minute to solve). While The Mini is smaller and simpler than a normal crossword, it isn't always easy. Tripping up on one clue can be the difference between a personal best completion time and an embarrassing solve attempt.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Here's a juicy bit of tech history: Back in 2013, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) legendary founder Morris Chang asked Nvidia's (NVDA) Jensen Huang to take over as CEO. It wasn't just a casual pitch. Chang laid out a 10-minute vision for Taiwan Semiconductor's future, convinced Huang's industry smarts and leadership chops made him the perfect successor. But Huang? He shut it down, quick, with a polite, I already have a job. That job, of course, was running Nvidia. And oh, how that decision paid off. Nvidia exploded into the AI juggernaut it is today, while Taiwan Semiconductor thrived under new leadership, cementing itself as the chipmaking kingpin for giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with TSM. This moment is more than just a fun anecdoteit's a masterclass in leadership and strategy. Huang's decision to stick with Nvidia wasn't just loyalty; it was foresight. By doubling down on Nvidia's potential, he steered the company to a $1 trillion market cap, driven by insatiable AI demand. Meanwhile, Chang's knack for partnerships and market positioning turned Taiwan Semiconductor into the semiconductor backbone of the digital economy. It's no coincidence these two companies remain tethered, with Taiwan Semiconductor producing Nvidia's cutting-edge chips. Their trajectories highlight the power of staying the course and playing to your strengthsa lesson Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is now trying to catch up on as it chases the foundry crown. For investors, this is a clear signal: Leadership decisions aren't just boardroom dramathey're market movers. Chang and Huang's mutual respect and strategic brilliance laid the groundwork for today's AI and semiconductor boom. Nvidia's rise in AI and Taiwan Semiconductor's dominance in chipmaking didn't happen by luckit happened because of visionary calls like these. The takeaway? Bet on the leaders who see not just the game ahead but the game-changing partnerships that will take them there. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Rugby player-backed pub chain reports profits of almost €600,000

Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien, Dave Kearney and Rob Kearney have a minority shareholding alongside Noel Anderson Outside McSorley's were Noel Anderson (2nd from left) and his fellow directors, Sean O’Brien, Jamie Heaslip and Rob Kearney Three Dublin pubs part-owned by former Ireland rugby players Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien, Dave Kearney and Rob Kearney enjoyed combined post-tax profits of €592,369, despite the Dublin riots “wiping off two weeks of trade”. The four have minority shareholdings in three Dublin pubs – Lemon & Duke, Bridge 1859 and The Blackrock – in a venture with publican Noel Anderson who has a controlling interest in the pub group. Mr Anderson and the former rugby players have expanded their Grand Slam Bars group this year with the reported €5.5m purchase of McSorley's in Ranelagh. Consolidated accounts for the pub group, Pinewood Bars, and subsidiaries show revenues increased by 23pc from €7.64m to €9.39m in the 12 months to the end of February this year. The new accounts show Bridge 1859 located in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 recorded post-tax profits of €178,208 while Lemon & Duke recorded post-tax profits of €213,348. The company that operates The Blackrock, Carysfort Inns Ltd, recorded profits of €200,813. In an interview, Mr Anderson said: “Honestly we've never had to work as hard to make money in our entire lives.” When asked to comment on the pubs’ financial performance in the 12 months to the end of February this year, he said, “all in all, not too bad”. “Obviously, the Dublin riots didn't help. The riots wiped off two weeks of trade at a very busy time of the year.” "We would still be very much encouraging the Government to keep the streets clean and get more gardaí on the streets – it’s not rocket science.” He said transport at night is a major issue for the city that needs to be fixed. "We need more taxis in and out of the city,” he said. The former rugby players serve as directors on the subsidiary firms. Directors this year shared ‘ambassador fees' of €40,000. A breakdown in the Pinewood Bar revenues show the group recorded drink sales of €5.74m, food sales of €3.59m and tea and coffee sales of €44,031. On last year’s financial performance, Mr Anderson said “Bridge: solid. Blackrock: getting to where it needs to be.” “It is challenging with wage demands and price increases,” he said. Numbers employed at the group are now “just shy of 200", according to Mr Anderson. Staff costs last year increased from €3.04m to €3.77m. Mr Anderson said the former rugby players take "an active interest" in the business. “I am not long off the phone with Rob (Kearney) and we are very excited by McSorley's in Ranelagh. We have ambitious plans for it next year. Watch this space. Food will be a big part of what we do there." The combined profits of €592,369 for the three pubs followed aggregate profits of €625,879 for the prior year where a portion of the Lemon & Duke profits were the proceeds of the business interruption insurance payout by FBD that arose from the firm's successful High Court challenge over Covid-19 insurance payouts. A note attached to the Pinewood Bars accounts states the group has entered into a loan arrangement to assist with the purchase of another licensed premises “to the value of €1.3m”. Shareholder funds at Pinewood Bars and subsidiaries at the end of February last totalled €4.75m. Cash funds reduced from €1.4m to €952,221.

Title: This headstrap can add comfort and battery to your Meta Quest 3 this Black Friday

KIWI's leather cushioning will ease your headache woes When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Meta Quest 3 and 3S are practical little devices for VR gaming, but their head straps are, not to be too mean, a little basic. Don't get me wrong, the clever tightening loops that slide along the back side are nice and easy to adjust, but if you were hoping for any cushioning at all, you may be left wanting. That's okay though because if you've been struggling to play for longer sessions with the Quest 3 or Quest 3S, there are third-party head straps that could absolutely change the game for you, as they did me. KIWI Design is my favorite, and in a special Black Friday treat, it's offering both its battery and comfort head straps for less. If you don't care too much about battery life, the Comfort Head Strap is going for just $19.99 at Amazon at the moment, which is the cheapest I've ever seen it drop to, and I track its price on a weekly basis. Black Friday Meta Quest deals like this can offer you the chance to boost the quality of life of your headset, even if the 3 and 3S devices aren't discounted in their own rights. If you've got a bit more money to play around with, you may be more interested in KIWI's battery-boosting option, which gives you the same plush comfort, but also gives your headset a longer lifespan. It's currently going for $39.79 at Amazon. KIWI Design Comfort Head Strap for Quest 3 / 3S | $39.99 $19.99 at AmazonSave $29 - Now, unfortunately, this is a Prime-exclusive deal, which means if you're not a paying member, you could take out a free trial and cancel before it takes any money away from you. Also, don't forget to tick the $10 coupon box on the retail page to get the full saving. Buy it if: ✅ You find the stock head strap uncomfortable✅ You like plush cushioning✅ You want something designed by a Meta partner Don't buy it if: ❌ You're hoping to use this with another VR headset❌ You want the Battery pack version UK: £25.49 at Amazon There's a lot to like about KIWI's Comfort head straps, and since testing one out with the Meta Quest 3, it's the only one I use. It should be noted that if you have the Meta Quest 3S, KIWI's straps will work with your device too. Thankfully, the designs of the two headsets are similar enough that they can make use of the same Meta Quest accessories. The comfort level of the KIWI Battery head strap really surprised me, because, for a cheaper add-on by a third-party brand, it feels extremely premium. It's got really plush cushioning that hugs your noggin while you play, and the leather material feels nice and genuine - I haven't noted any degradation or peeling that would point to a cheaper substitute being used. The battery version is particularly useful and has added many hours to my Blade & Sorcery survival mode runs. Whiling away the hours slaughtering NPCs has never been easier, and if anything, KIWI's head straps are responsible for the countless virtual lives I've taken in increasingly brutal ways. Luckily, it braces my head really gently thanks to its adjustable length, and I never feel that forehead ache like I sometimes can with the stock head strap. If there's one issue with this best Meta Quest accessory, it's maybe that it makes the headset feel as though it's sitting higher up on your head, and a little less secure when playing more active games. If you use the Quest 3 for a lot of fitness apps, maybe look for something more slimline, but I'm sure it wouldn't be a deal breaker and you could find the right fit for you and your use cases. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Don't forget there are also Black Friday VR headset deals running, as well as Black Friday Xbox deals, and Black Friday gaming chair deals. One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote Holy Black Friday Batman - this Meta Quest 3 deal comes with a $75 online gift card PSVR 2 is cheaper than the Quest 3S right now, and I know which one I'd buy this Black Friday Dev of one of our favorite strategy games of the year says he's unbelievably lucky to be in his position GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Depending on where you live, Cyber Monday may already be over. However, many businesses operate with Pacific time in mind, even if they're located elsewhere. That means several sales are still running, but only an hour remains before the Cyber Monday deals all expire. Most deals end at midnight PT, but some discounts have already expired, from what I can see. If you've been unable to shop this week's deals, this last hour is your final window to score the best savings of 2024. After this, there are no more sales coming until next year. After hours of filtering through thousands of deals all month long, our team of experienced deal hunters has gathered the very best discounts on products we love, below. Skip the hunting and keep scrolling to check out deals that you can trust. The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Max is a premium service for fans of prestige television, iconic films, and unscripted programs like Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Succession, House of the Dragon, The Last of Us, and more. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but a special Cyber Monday promo has lowered the price to $2.99 monthly for six months. Otherwise, you're looking at $17 for ad-free and $21 if you want to view in 4K. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. Monthly fees are usually $7.99, but the current Cyber Monday promo slashes that price down to $1.99 for six months on the ad-supported tier. Or you can go for a year at just $20. Offer expires December 2. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99.

This Corsair drive is a great all-around PS5 SSD with a selection of sizes from 1GB up to 8TB. The built-in heatsink saves you a few dollars over buying one yourself and makes for a slightly easier installation process. 1TB/2TB is plenty for most gamers and is where the best value lies as the price jump on larger capcities is wildly disproportionate on a dollar per GB ratio. The J9+ is a powerful robot vacuum that deftly navigates around household obstacles, leaves hardwood floors spotless, and tackles low-pile carpets with ease. Although we haven't tried this exact model, we've tested a similar Shark 2-1 robot vacuum with Matrix technology and had great results. It has both standard suction and mopping abilities, hence the 2-1 in the name. We tested the Shark PowerDetect in a different color and found it was the best robot vacuum for pet hear, thanks to its roomy, self-empty charging dock and powerful suction when it detects heavy debris. The Ecovacs DEEBOT X2 OMNI Robot Vacuum & Mop is a wet-dry vacuum robot that maps your house quickly and has a station with a hands-off self-cleaning system.

They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable. Learn more about which Quince's styles we've tried in our full Quince review. Gabrielle Chase. I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

Title: I recommend Meta Ray-Bans over AirPods Pro as the best tech deal of Black Friday 2024

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable.

Title: Grand Slam Bars group profitable despite Dublin riots dent in trade
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/11/29/grand-slam-bars-group-profitable-despite-dublin-riots-dent-in-trade/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T17:28:28Z
Full Content:
Three pubs part-owned by former Ireland rugby stars Jamie Heaslip, Sean O’Brien and Dave and Rob Kearney this year enjoyed combined post-tax profits of €592,369 despite the Dublin riots “wiping off two weeks of trade”. The foursome have minority shareholdings in three Dublin pubs – Lemon & Duke, Bridge 1859 and The Blackrock – in a venture with publican Noel Anderson who holds a controlling interest in the group. Mr Anderson and his colleagues expanded the Grand Slam Bars group this year with the reported €5.5 million purchase of McSorley’s in Ranelagh. Consolidated accounts for the group, Pinewood Bars and subsidiaries, show revenues increased by 23 per cent from €7.64 million to €9.39 million in the 12 months to the end of February this year. Bridge 1859 in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 recorded post-tax profits of €178,208 while the Lemon & Duke recorded post-tax profits of €213,348. The company that operates The Blackrock, Carysfort Inns Ltd, enjoyed profits of €200,813. “Honestly we’ve never had to work as hard to make money in our entire lives,” Mr Anderson said. He described the pubs’ financial performance in the 12 months to the end of February this year as “all in all, not too bad”. “Obviously, the Dublin riots didn’t help. The riots wiped off two weeks of trade at a very busy time of the year.” The former Irish international rugby players serve as directors on the subsidiary firms and directors this year shared “ambassador fees” of €40,000. A breakdown of the Pinewood Bar revenues show the group recorded drink sales of €5.74 million, food sales of €3.59 million and tea and coffee sales of €44,031. Numbers employed at the group are now “just shy of 200″ according to Mr Anderson. Staff costs last year increased from €3.04 million to €3.77 million. Mr Anderson said his ex-rugby international colleagues take “an active interest” in the business. “I am not long off the phone with Rob [Kearney] and we are very excited by McSorley’s in Ranelagh. We have ambitious plans for it next year – watch this space. Food will be a big part of what we do there.” The combined profits of €592,369 for the three pubs this year followed aggregate profits of €625,879 for the prior year where a portion of the Lemon and Duke profits were the proceeds of the business interruption insurance payout by FBD that arose from the firm’s successful High Court challenge over Covid-19 cover.

Title: Black Friday deals: 2024 Samsung Galaxy tabs from $149, Google Nest bundles $100 off, Backbone One gaming controller, much more
URL: http://9to5google.com/2024/11/29/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-tabs-google-nest/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T17:06:34Z
Full Content:
We have now updated our massive collection of Black Friday deals, the Google sale is already live, and Samsung is in full swing, but there’s even more we want to bring to your attention. Firstly, Backbone One USB-C – one of the best Android mobile game controllers – is now seeing solid price drops, but we also have Samsung’s originally $600 34-inch Odyssey G5 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor at just $265 as well. A fresh collection of Google Nest deals are also live – Nest Doorbell and cameras are now now up to $100 off – and we have some seriously notable deals on ultra-affordable A9+ and S6 Samsung Galaxy tabs from $149. Everything else awaits below. If you’re looking for a super affordable 2024 tablet for casual browsing, video chatting, or even something for the whole fam, the Amazon Black Friday sale is now offering Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Android tablet down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $330, this is $130 off, $30 below the early Black Friday sale price, and within $0.50 of the lowest we have ever tracked. This is easily one of the most notable deals we have tracked since its release back in April and among the most affordable Samsung tablets we have seen to date that actually ships with the S Pen in the box. It is worth noting that the Galaxy Tab S6 comes in at roughly $50 more than the Black Friday deal we are tracking on the brand’s other ultra-affordable tab, the Galaxy Tab A9+ at $149 shipped. However, as alluded to above, the S6 is a more complete experience with slightly better specs and includes the Samsung S Pen so you can sketch and doodle away without spending any more money. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: The Google Black Friday sale is now live, we are tracking the very first price drop on the all-new Google Nest Learning Thermostat 4th Gen, and now it’s time to take a look at the rest of this year’s Google Nest Black Friday offers. Alongside the new smart thermostat deal, we are also tracking price drops on the latest Nest Cam Outdoor or Indoor Battery model as well as the wired indoor variants and the Google Nest Doorbell down at $99.98 shipped in all colorways. This includes both the wireless and the wired options for folks looking to integrate the smart video doorbell into an existing chime and power system. Everything you need to know about the all-time low now live on the brand new Google Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) is waiting right here. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. As part of its Black Friday deals, Amazon is offering one of the best gaming monitor deals by dropping Samsung’s 34-inch Odyssey G55T 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor to $265.04 shipped. This originally $600 gaming display has fetched as much as $500 in recent months, but it has mostly been sitting at the $380 mark. We saw it drop to $300 over a month ago in September, but today’s Black Friday deal at Amazon lands it $35 below that price to mark a new all-time low. This is easily one of the best gaming monitor deals we’ve tracked over the last few weeks for Black Friday, and you can learn more about this model below. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

The cryptocurrency market in November 2024 showcased significant milestones, regulatory shifts, and industry trends. Here are the key takeaways: November 2024 marked a historic moment in the cryptocurrency market, driven by the increasing influence of U.S.-approved spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). With inflows reaching $6.2 billion this month alone, these ETFs have significantly transformed Bitcoin’s adoption trajectory. The shift from futures-based ETFs to spot ETFs signals greater confidence among institutional investors and provides a regulated, accessible pathway for traditional finance to engage with Bitcoin. Unlike futures ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs track the cryptocurrency’s market price directly, eliminating inefficiencies caused by contango or backwardation in futures markets. The inflow of institutional funds has reshaped Bitcoin’s market dynamics: Source: Santiment Source: Farside Investors Source: Glassnode Bitcoin’s performance in November 2024 reflects the combined impact of macroeconomic forces and on-chain dynamics. With institutional confidence growing and on-chain activity reaching new heights, Bitcoin remains a dominant force in the cryptocurrency landscape. However, cautious optimism is advised as the market approaches the critical $100,000 milestone. November 2024 has been a month of technical milestones for Bitcoin, with bullish patterns forming on the charts. A key highlight is Bitcoin’s breakout from a multi-month ascending triangle, signaling strong upward momentum. This section analyzes the technical indicators that defined Bitcoin’s trajectory this month and explores potential scenarios for December. Whale accumulation: Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s technical performance in November underscores its bullish trajectory, with strong patterns and indicators supporting further upward movement. While challenges remain at critical resistance levels, the outlook for December remains optimistic, driven by both technical and on-chain factors. Ethereum has maintained its position as a leading blockchain network in November 2024, driven by record-high staking participation, significant contributions to the DeFi sector, and anticipation for its next major upgrade. These developments underscore Ethereum’s resilience and adaptability in a competitive crypto landscape. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) continues to strengthen, with staking metrics reaching new milestones: Source: Dune Analytics Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance ecosystem, contributing to its robust performance: Source: DefiLlama Ethereum’s development roadmap remains a critical driver of its market sentiment: Ethereum’s price movements mirrored its strong fundamentals: Ethereum’s achievements in November 2024 highlight its leadership in staking, DeFi, and network development. With record-high staking participation, growing Layer 2 adoption, and a major upgrade on the horizon, Ethereum is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in the blockchain ecosystem. November 2024 marked a defining moment for Solana (SOL), as it solidified its position as a leading altcoin through groundbreaking performance and ecosystem growth. With its price reaching an all-time high of $264, significant institutional interest, and surging decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, Solana has emerged as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency landscape. Source: DefiLlama Solana’s breakout performance in November 2024 underscores its potential as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market. With record highs in price, trading volume, and ecosystem adoption, Solana is poised to redefine its role in the blockchain space. For market participants, aligning with its growth trajectory could yield substantial rewards in the months to come. Donald Trump’s re-election in 2024 has ushered in a pro-crypto agenda aimed at fostering innovation and regulatory clarity. This shift has bolstered the cryptocurrency market, driving institutional participation and expanding the scope of digital asset investment vehicles. A key development has been the wave of spot Bitcoin and Solana ETF filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reflecting the growing interest in regulated crypto products. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto governance is shaping the U.S. cryptocurrency market by fostering innovation, attracting institutional capital, and expanding investment opportunities. The influx of ETF filings, including those for Solana and Bitcoin, highlights the evolving landscape. With regulatory clarity on the horizon, the U.S. is poised to solidify its position as a global leader in digital assets. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of innovation within the blockchain ecosystem. In November 2024, AI-focused tokens surged in popularity, driven by partnerships, real-world applications, and increasing institutional interest. These tokens are bridging the gap between blockchain technology and AI, positioning themselves as key players in the Web3 landscape. Risk management: AI tokens are reshaping the Web3 narrative by bringing real-world utility to blockchain technology. As adoption grows across industries, these tokens have the potential to redefine how decentralized ecosystems interact with AI. For traders and investors, the focus should remain on projects with strong partnerships, innovative applications, and a clear regulatory roadmap. Blockchain gaming continues to solidify its role in the Web3 ecosystem, addressing criticisms of prioritizing profits over playability. November 2024 witnessed notable advancements as projects focused on enhancing gameplay experiences, while adoption metrics highlighted the sector’s resilience. This section explores key trends, case studies, and market performance within the blockchain gaming landscape. Blockchain gaming is undergoing a transformative phase, balancing profitability with meaningful player experiences. As projects innovate to address accessibility and retention, the sector’s potential to drive Web3 adoption becomes increasingly apparent. For market participants, staying aligned with evolving player preferences and technological advancements will be crucial. Blockchain is pushing the boundaries of what Play-to-Earn (P2E) models can achieve. In November 2024, AMBCrypto conducted an exclusive survey involving over 5,000 participants, shedding light on key challenges and opportunities in this growing sector. The findings reveal a shift in player priorities, with an increasing emphasis on playability and sustainable ecosystems. The NFT market in November 2024 continued its transformation from a speculation-driven space to one emphasizing real-world utility and innovation. While trading volumes declined by 15% MoM, projects focusing on functional NFTs gained traction, highlighting a shift in market priorities. Source: NFTGo The NFT market in November 2024 reflects a critical pivot toward sustainability and utility. As speculative interest wanes, projects delivering real-world benefits are poised to lead the next phase of growth. For investors and participants, focusing on functional NFTs and cross-chain innovations will be key to staying ahead in this evolving landscape.

Title: What's Happening With Super Micro Stock?

Time Published: 2024-11-29T16:30:05Z

POLAND - 2024/11/15: In this photo illustration, a Super Micro logo is displayed on a smartphone ... [+] with stock market percentages in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Server maker Super Micro Computer stock (NASDAQ: SMCI) extended its recent rally, gaining close to 30% over the last five trading days. The stock now trades at $35 per share, up about 2x from recent lows seen around mid-November, when investors were concerned about the company’s potential delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. Last week, the company said that it had hired BDO as its public auditor, replacing Ernst & Young, who resigned in October after it raised concerns regarding the accuracy of the company’s financial statements. With the new public auditor on board, Super Micro is expected to gain additional time to avoid delisting from Nasdaq as it works to file its overdue 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 2024 and its September quarter report. Separately, see how Disney may be undervalued in Disney Stock To 2x? Looking over a longer period, SMCI stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 39% in 2021, 87% in 2022, and 246% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Now even considering the strong historical performance and the recent rally, SMCI stock is still down by a massive 70% from its all-time highs earlier this year. The stock also trades at just about 9x projected 2025 earnings. However, jumping into SMCI stock might not be a wise move just yet, in our view. Here’s why. Significant risks remain for Super Micro. The company’s new auditor will have to rework its financial statements and this process will likely take time. Super Micro has only indicated in filings that it plans to submit its overdue financial reports, but has not provided a specific timeline. Separately, earlier this week, the company announced it had prepaid borrowings from Bank of America and Cathay Bank. Some of the debt had covenants that required the company to file its FY 2024 and most recent quarterly financial statements by December 31. On the upside, by fully prepaying these loans, SMCI has eliminated the need to meet this reporting deadline. On the downside, this could also signal that there could be further delays in filing its audited accounts. Now, Super Micro Computer has been a big winner in the generative AI space, as demand for its server systems surged as companies looked to deploy the latest GPUs using the company’s server solutions. Revenues more than doubled in FY’24, with consensus estimates pointing to an additional 80% increase for the current fiscal year. However, the AI growth story doesn’t compensate for the company’s corporate governance concerns and questions about its financial reporting. Want to profit from shifts in the AI market? Consider this trade Sell Nvidia, Buy AMD Stock The company’s recent troubles began in August after short-seller Hindenburg Research pointed to multiple red flags in the company’s accounting practices. Further, The Wall Street Journal reported in late September that the U.S. Justice Department may be probing the company, although the investigation was reportedly in its early stages at the time. The company’s history of delayed reports and concerns raised by various parties doesn’t exactly inspire trust. Even if the company’s valuation looks reasonable today, issues with internal controls and accounting practices may impact its long-term viability and ability to deliver shareholder value. It also remains to be seen if the new auditor will indeed sign off on the company’s accounts. Given these risks, it’s probably best to exercise caution with SMCI stock until there are signs that the company’s core accounting issues have been be resolved.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Rocket Lab USA (RKLB, Financial) reached its highest level at $27.5 per share on November 29, 2024 after recorded a single-day gain of 8.3%. This reflects an impressive 398% year to date return, fueled by increased investor risk appetite and a vibrant market environment. Currently, the company has a market capitalization of $13.5 billion, with expected annual revenue growth of 77%. Some financial highlights include the third quarter of 2024 revenues of $105 million, 55% more than a year earlier. So, in Q4, Rocket Lab's projected revenues are $125-$135 million and gross margins of 26-28%. Further, expanding the company's growth narrative, the company has been awarded a $23.9 million grant following the recent signing of the CHIPS Act to advance to increase semiconductor production in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The aerospace businesses also started their growth with this company. Its Neutron rocket went through the qualification process and secured the first commercial order. This is well aligned with Rocket Lab's current Electron rocket, which will be instrumental in this firm. Wall Street has paid attention, adjusting price targets for the Company BofA Securities, Cantor Fitzgerald, and TD Cowen to show a hopeful forward for Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab's progress includes building and launching the Neutron rocket while achieving notable milestones. The company has accomplished two launches in under 24 hours and secured a multi-launch deal for its Neutron lander. It has achieved these milestones by demonstrating its position as a responsive space solutions provider and a comprehensive aerospace solutions and services company.?

UPDATED 10:16 EST / NOVEMBER 29 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof It’s time to get ready for Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference, starting Monday in Las Vegas — the biggest cloud computing conference of the year. To prepare, check out our new Special Report: AI and the Cloud, with exclusive features, interviews and analysis, and all the important news starting next week. We take a deep dive into AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation, whose products we’ll hear a lot about at re:Invent, and also analyze the prospects for AI’s hottest new thing, agents, as well as the considerable challenges to their roll-out. That’s also certain to be a hot topic at the event. In addition, theCUBE Research analyst John Furrier interviewed top AWS executives ahead of re:Invent, including CEO Matt Garman, AI and data chief Swami Sivasubramanian, enterprise solutions head Colleen Aubrey, developer experience VP Deepak Singh, and Dilip Kumar, head of Q for Business. We’ll have all the news next week from re:Invent keynotes and interviews, along with analysis from theCUBE Research and interviews on theCUBE. In other news this past week, big money continued to roll into cybersecurity as Halcyon raised $100 million and N-able acquired Adlumin for $266 million. TheCUBE Research Chief Analyst Dave Vellante assessed his 2024 predictions. ChatGPT gave him an A-, but he gave himself a B. This week saw a mixed bag of earnings reports ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but some significant guidance disappointments from Dell, HP, CrowdStrike and Workday weighed on stocks.

Title: Conor McGregor Inc: the fighter’s potential losses in the fallout from civil rape case are enormous
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2024/11/30/conor-mcgregor-inc-how-the-fighters-business-brand-has-been-tarnished-by-civil-rape-trial-ruling/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T15:04:38Z
Full Content:
When a High Court jury found against Conor McGregor in his civil rape case last week, the Hollywood Reporter jumped on the story of his legal woes. The coverage in the US film industry’s go-to news publication was as big a sign as any of McGregor’s seemingly unstoppable journey into the ritzy world of entertainment from the bloodied mixed martial arts octagon. Now he is counting the cost of what he did on that December 2018 day in the penthouse suite of the Beacon Hotel in Sandyford, south Dublin. His potential losses in the fallout from the case are enormous. This was shaping up to a big year for McGregor. But that was before Nikita Hand told a believing jury of a terrifying sexual assault by a professional fighter who “would not take no for an answer”. The Dublin woman was awarded nearly €250,000 in damages after the jury found that she was raped by McGregor in the Dublin hotel in December 2018. McGregor (36) owns three Dublin pubs: the Black Forge Inn and the Marble Arch in Drimnagh, and the Waterside in Howth, where plans for a boutique hotel were rejected by Fingal County Council. But he always wanted to stride on a bigger stage – and did so with alacrity. [ Conor McGregor was facilitated by a culture of entitlement and cheered on by adoring fansOpens in new window ] He made his Hollywood debut in March, starring in the move Road House with A-list actor Jake Gyllenhaal. In June he struck a new deal to use his image in the Hitman video game, a global franchise. He continued to promote Proper No. Twelve, the whiskey brand he sold three years ago for $130 million (€123 million) and was on a drive to create international markets for his Forged Stout brand. The sales slogan said much about his ambition for the new brew: “Better watch out, because we’re not here to take part, we’re here to take over.” It echoes McGregor’s famous line from his post-fight octagon interview at UFC Fight Night Dublin in 2014, when he was at the vanguard of a number of Irish fighters appearing on the promotion. Now it is events that have taken over, threatening an empire that traded on McGregor’s ability to connect directly with a certain cohort of young men with an almost cult-like appeal. Ms Hand’s account of how McGregor “brutally raped and battered her” has dealt a crippling blow to his earning power. Retailers are taking McGregor drink from their shelves – and his image has been pulled from whiskey marketing and video games. His childhood soccer team in Crumlin, Lourdes Celtic, is said locally to be removing his name from players’ kit but the club itself did not reply to questions. Even the National Wax Museum has removed his sculpture. Forged Stout was sold in off-licences and supermarkets and a relatively small number of pubs so the delisting inflicts financial pain. However, for the McGregor brand the real money was in the US. There could be serious implications there too. “Financially, and then [in terms of] future revenue generating, it’s very damaging for him,” said Prof Norm O’Reilly, author of 20 books on sports sponsorship and dean of the University of New England business school. “I would say for most brands this is now like a hands-off, certainly in the very short term. It doesn’t look good. It’s about images. Image transfer is the core of why sponsorship works. He added: “If you and I own a company and we’re trying to be a little edgy, he’s no longer our choice, right?” There are “many other athletes out there who have a bit of edge” but who haven’t “done something like this to women”, said Prof O’Reilly. McGregor was in full plumage when he claimed to be “the highest-paid first-time actor of all time” for his villain role in Road House, an action thriller remake of a 1980s blockbuster that starred the late Patrick Swayze. He is said to have received $5 million for the role, prompting his claim to have been paid more than wrestler-turned Hollywood star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson when he burst on to the screen decades ago. Nikita Hand has won her civil case against MMA fighter Conor McGregor. The 35 year-old Dublin woman alleged he raped her in the penthouse suite of The Beacon Hotel in December 2018. The jury, believing her account of assault, found in her favour; returning a verdict yesterday evening after six hours of deliberations. McGregor has been ordered to pay Ms. Hand almost €250,000 in damages. But why has the UFC fighter not been found guilty of rape? How has Ms. Hand successfully sued him in the High Court? And what did the jury hear to persuade them she was the one telling the truth. Frank Greaney is courts correspondent for the Bauer Media group, which owns radio stations including Newstalk and TodayFM. He explains how Nikita Hand faced down McGregor at great personal cost. Please be advised this episode contains details of sexual assault, which some listeners may find distressing.Produced and presented by Aideen Finnegan. Johnson is now a superstar. Any hopes of McGregor to follow him or Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder-turned movie star-turned politician, must be measured against the jury’s verdict. Despite the boycott, Road House remains on Amazon Prime’s streaming service. The company had nothing to say about McGregor. “We’re not offering any comment,” Amazon Prime said. McGregor’s Hollywood agent, Audie Attar, did not reply to questions. Similarly, his London-based spokeswoman did not respond to queries. These included the question of whether McGregor was contractually bound to repay fees in the event of adverse court findings. “Those are pretty common in contracts now if this [behaviour] is over a line that the brands wanted,” Prof O’Reilly said. The business meltdown started on Monday when IO Interactive, Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise, cut ties with the fighter. “In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately,” the company said. “We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr McGregor from our storefronts starting today.” IO Interactive did not respond to further questions. Yet it is clear the company had high hopes for a Hitman game with a “mysterious Disruptor featuring global superstar Conor McGregor”. At the time IO Interactive said it was “beyond thrilled” to work with the fighter, citing his “raw charisma and energy”. McGregor said he had “a lot of fun creating the character and bringing him to life”. All of that has now ended. The Irish response was less immediate, coming two days after Rape Crisis Network Ireland urged retailers to stop selling McGregor stout and the whiskey brand he sold to Mexican group Proximo Spirits in 2021. But the dam broke just before lunchtime on Tuesday when Barry Group, owner of Costcutter stores and Carry Out off-licences, became the first to drop Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey, saying: “This action reflects our commitment to maintaining a retail environment that resonates with the values of our customers and partners.” [ More than 1,000 shops including Tesco, SuperValu and Centra stores remove brands linked to Conor McGregorOpens in new window ] Musgrave, owner of the Supervalu and Centra chains, quickly followed. So too did wholesaler BWG, saying it will no longer distribute McGregor-linked brands to Spar, Eurospar, Mace, Londis and XL stores. BWG’s decision removed product from 1,000 outlets. Bigger still was Tesco’s move to delist McGregor brands from more than 4,200 Irish and UK stores and its online shop. Then came the response of Proximo, the Mexican owner of Bushmills Irish whiskey and Tequila which made a big bet on Proper No. Twelve in 2021: “Going forward, we do not plan to use Mr McGregor’s name and likeness in the marketing of the brand.” The properwhiskey.com website was soon offline. The bad news kept coming. Retailer Asda dropped Forged Stout from 500 UK stores on Thursday. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon cut the product from seven Irish pubs. Off-licence chain O’Brien’s cut both stout and whiskey, as did State airport group DAA. Manchester-based LWC, the UK’s largest independent drinks wholesaler, also cut ties with McGregor, saying it had taken the “necessary legal steps” to end distribution of his stout. [ From the very start Conor McGregor was telling us and showing us who he wasOpens in new window ] “We are consulting with our customers to support them in the replacement of Forged draught taps. LWC does not want to be associated with Conor McGregor or Forged Irish Stout.” The irony is that McGregor’s “notorious” image once gave business something akin to a golden ticket into the world of young men. Research in 2016 by a sports consultancy then known PSG Sponsorship showed he was the athlete most admired by almost one-in-three Irish people aged 18-34. He was less popular with older people. But the nationwide poll of 1,000 people reflected McGregor’s meteoric rise, placing him ahead of boxer Katie Taylor, rowers Gary and Paul O’Donovan, jockey Ruby Walsh, rugby star Johnny Sexton and soccer player Robbie Keane. He was sixth most popular only two years earlier. Although this carried immense business appeal, the accounts of McGregor’s main Dublin company give little insight into his overall fortune. Abridged financial statements filed on Monday for McGregor Sports and Entertainment Ltd show profits fell in 2023 to €194,297 from €528,263 the previous year, with accumulated profits at €506,475. No longer is the image positive, it’s negative ... now the brand senses a problem McGregor’s returns from the $130 million Proximo deal and the $100 million he reportedly received for a Las Vegas boxing defeat in 2017 to Floyd Mayweather seem to be elsewhere. The money came on top of the tens of millions of dollars he earned from his UFC fight career. Business magazine Forbes listed him as the world’s highest-paid athlete in 2021, behind football stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with salary/winnings of $22 million and endorsements of $158 million. For as long as it lasted, business was fully behind McGregor’s macho personality. “Only a very, very few athletes have properties that reach the kind of markets he does,” said Prof O’Reilly. “He’s kind of on the edge but he’s never really gone over the edge.” That changed with the High Court verdict, no matter that these were civil and not criminal proceedings. “So, no longer is the image positive, it’s negative. So now the brand senses a problem,” said Prof O’Reilly. Right now, McGregor is short on supporters. But one man who has leapt to his defence is Roger Stone, acolyte of incoming US president Donald Trump and a Republican Party activist going back to the time of Richard Nixon. In a bizarre claim, Stone contended in a message to McGregor on X that the allegations against him stemmed from the fighter “telling the truth about how they are trying to destroy free speech in your country”. “Don’t give up. Keep fighting for the Ireland you love. God bless you,” Stone told him in the social media post. Stone’s intervention was in line with dismissive response of the Make America Great Again movement to court findings against Trump. Still, this was a world away from the mass-market allure that McGregor cultivated. Only weeks have passed since a Netflix boxing match yielded a $20 million pay-day for Mike Tyson, who served a prison term for rape in 1990s. Asked whether this showed McGregor could find a way back, Prof O’Reilly said Tyson’s appeal was at the box office, not in sponsorship. Mixed martial arts sponsors may stay with McGregor but “they’re very small”, he said. The bigger potential loss was from sponsors not directly linked to fighting. Citing Tiger Woods’ loss of non-golf sponsors after the exposure of his marital infidelity, Prof O’Reilly said: “It’s literally cost him hundreds of millions of dollars.” McGregor will appeal the court findings but the strain on his business interests could hardly be greater. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Gains Momentum as Bank of America Raises Price Target to $75

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive “critical shock” for the country’s fiscal health. READ NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings The Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years. “The use of AI presents the rare — possibly unique — opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system”. While adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists’ outlook on AI and healthcare is “a mix of enthusiasm and despair”. “Enthusiasm because there’s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. … But there’s friction due to regulation, due to incentives — because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things — and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities”. In other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence continues to achieve remarkable breakthroughs, yet its latest contribution might come as a surprise to many. According to a report by CNBC, AI can solve one of the biggest problems facing the USA: its skyrocketing fiscal deficit. According to three economists from the Brookings Institution, artificial intelligence could prove a positive “critical shock” for the country’s fiscal health. READ NOW: 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings The Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings released a working paper last month stating that under the most optimistic scenario, AI could reduce the annual U.S. budget deficit by as much as 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2044. This would lower annual budget deficits by roughly one-fifth at the end of the 20 years. “The use of AI presents the rare — possibly unique — opportunity to expand access to health care information and services while simultaneously reducing the burden on the conventional health care system”. While adopting AI in healthcare is optimistic, Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, reveals how economists’ outlook on AI and healthcare is “a mix of enthusiasm and despair”. “Enthusiasm because there’s probably no sector that stands to benefit more from AI than health care. … But there’s friction due to regulation, due to incentives — because of the way things are structured and how people are paid for things — and friction due to the associated risks and liabilities”. In other news, CNBC reported that OpenAI has allowed its employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank. Current and former OpenAI employees will be able to cash out their shares this way, while the Japanese tech conglomerate will be able to get a larger slice of the pie of the AI startup. The tender offer follows the persistence of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son after he made a $500 million investment in OpenAI's recent funding round, also reflecting his growing interest in AI. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been communicating with Donald Trump in recent months through secret back channels, helping the president-elect hammer out a policy agenda before and since his decisive White House victory, The Post has learned. The 68-year-old Wall Street titan — who, like 78-year-old Trump, grew up in Queens in New York City — has acted as “a sounding board” for the incoming commander-in-chief’s economic manifesto, four sources close to Trump’s transition team said. One GOP insider said the president-elect’s inner circle held a series of “no-holds-barred conversations” with Dimon — who at the time was rumored to be eyeing a government job himself. “They have been speaking regularly for months,” said another GOP source briefed on the situation. Three of the sources close to Trump said the secret back channel focused on plans for cutting government spending, banking regulation, taxes and trade. A company insider added that Trump’s top aides set up the calls, which continued after the election, to “create a bit of daylight” between the two men and stop details of the exchanges leaking. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokesman also declined to comment. The quietly cozy relationship between Trump and Dimon has flourished despite the banker’s cryptic and tight-lipped tendencies when it comes to politics. Trump had floated Dimon’s name as a possible Treasury secretary pick in June and later claimed he had won his White House endorsement — despite a lack of any public statement from Dimon to that effect. Trump and Dimon also have continued to talk despite bouts of tension, including on Nov. 14 when the president-elect declared on Truth Social that Dimon ”will not be invited” to join his Cabinet. The banker promptly shot back: “I haven’t had a boss in 25 years and I’m not about ready to start.” The JPMorgan CEO, a registered Democrat who declined to back either candidate in the White House race, had even reportedly toyed with the idea of joining a Kamala Harris administration but then ruled himself out of leaving the Wall Street giant when her poll numbers tanked, The Post previously reported. On Nov. 22, The Post broke the news that Trump was also consulting with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink, a major Dem donor, on policy issues. Nevertheless, the former” Apprentice” star’s admiration of Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase for nearly two decades and has a net worth estimated by Forbes at $2.6 billion, was described by one source as “a man crush.” Another individual close to the president-elect said Trump “greatly appreciated” it when Dimon, an avid reader of the New York Post, told CNBC in January the eventual election winner was “kind of right” to criticize illegal immigration and weak defense spending by America’s NATO allies. Dimon’s comments angered left-wingers within the Biden administration who then blacklisted Dimon from the White House in a fit of pique, as The Post exclusively reported. Two weeks ago, the JPMorgan boss said Trump’s threat of slapping tariffs on Uncle Sam’s major trading partners “will bring people to the table” if “done wisely.” Dimon, a vocal critic of current US banking rules, recently slammed the ‘onslaught’ of red tape drafted by Dem-backed regulators, launching a foul-mouthed tirade over a list of his most-hated pieces of legislation at a recent conference in New York, “It’s time to fight back…I’ve had it with this s–t,” Dimon told the stunned audience. The JPMorgan boss singled out regulations aimed at keeping banks resistant to financial storms by forcing them to hold more capital on their balance sheets. The proposal, known as Basel III, would see major lenders raise that emergency buffer by 9%. “Things are becoming unfair and unjust, and they are hurting companies, a lot of these rules are hurting lower-paid individuals,” Dimon said on Oct. 28. Dimon, who pulled down a salary of $34.5 million last year, urged the US government in his annual letter to shareholders last May to deliver “effective policy-making” issuing a warning that “a politician’s dream is a businessman’s nightmare.” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said Trump’s second term as president will present “the biggest inflection point for banking regulation in three decades.” “This is Jamie’s vindication,” Mayo told The Post. “He is looking at all the bureaucracy and red tape and saying enough of the regulatory theater. It’s like banking with one hand tied behind your back” Mayo added that Trump potentially taking an ax to stringent banking rules “should mean borrowers get better rates for their loans and better services for customers.” The top analyst said: “It would be foolhardy for any administration not to hear Jamie Dimon out. Everyone should at least be consulting him for ideas.” The revelations that Trump has sought advice from a “kitchen cabinet” of Wall Street bigwigs comes after his appointment of staunch loyalist and hedge fund mogul Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. He has been hunkered down at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach building his team for his new administration. Trump’s move to seek informal counsel from titans of American finance, who are outside his MAGA inner circle, could provide further reassurance to investors ahead of his second term in the White House that kicks off on Jan. 20.

NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is demanding the immediate release of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, saying that if they are not freed before he is sworn into office for a second term there will be “HELL TO PAY.” “Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social site. He added that, “Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!” It was not immediately clear whether Trump was threatening to directly involve the U.S. military in Israel’s ongoing campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Trump allies have said he hopes there will be a ceasefire and hostage release deal before he returns to office early next year. NBC4 Washington acknowledged Monday that veteran anchor Leon Harris “appeared unwell” when he struggled through a news segment last week – while announcing he was “stepping away” for health reasons. The well-known broadcaster raised eyebrows on Thanksgiving when he stumbled over his words and awkwardly hesitated at times while delivering local news. Shortly after the tough-to-watch performance, NBC4 meteorologist Ryan Miller claimed the 63-year-old Harris, who used to work for CNN, was “fine” — in response to the network receiving calls from worried fans.

The decision came after prosecutors presented a scathing letter to Judge Arun Subramanian, outlining alarming allegations of abuse and intimidation by the 54-year-old hip-hop icon. The letter described Combs as a dangerous individual with a history of violence and coercion, ultimately swaying the court to reject his plea for pretrial release. Donald Trump's allies are panicking about what they say is a potential "coup" being organized by Mitch McConnell against the incoming president. Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News host and far-right hero, took to social media on Saturday to warn his 14.5 million followers about the purported plan. "What the hell is going on in the US Senate?" Carlson asked. "Hours after Donald Trump wins the most conclusive mandate in 40 years, Mitch McConnell engineers a coup against his agenda by calling early leadership elections in the senate."

The Spectra model also has color-changing LED lights. The Tomtoc Carrying Case comes with an integrated stand that lets you play your Switch while charging it. This Ivoler case can be carried with a handle or shoulder strap. It's big enough to fit a Switch, dock, controller, and 18 game cards. Microsoft is offering an excellent selection of Cyber Monday gaming deals, including discounts on various Xbox consoles and accessories. The Xbox Series X Digital Edition is down to an all-time low of $398 while the 512GB Xbox Series S is $50 off at Walmart. This Series X model offers the same graphical performance as the standard edition but it does not include a disc drive. It typically costs $50 less than the disc-drive model. The Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as the Series X, but it still benefits from Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft's robust online services, offering great value for less money. The iconic Xbox Core controller works with various Xbox systems, but it can also connect to your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android. Microsoft’s official battery pack for the Xbox wireless controller replaces the standard AA batteries and can be charged with the controller’s usual USB cable. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers a Netflix-style subscription with hundreds of games for Xbox and PC, along with online multiplayer support. Members can also stream games on mobile devices, Samsung TVs, and select Fire TV sticks. An Ultimate membership typically costs $20, but most retailers sell one month for $17. PlayStation 5 systems and accessories are seeing great discounts for Cyber Monday. The Digital Edition console is down to a new low of $374. Meanwhile, the PS5 with disc drive is available for $75 off, and this PS VR2 bundle is a whopping $250 off. And though not discounted, the brand-new PS5 Pro is in stock for its regular price of $699. The PS5 is one of the best gaming consoles you can buy thanks to its powerful hardware, unique controller, and exclusive games. This model includes a disc drive and some free Fortnite content, like in-game outfits and weapons. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons. This bundle includes a slim disc-drive edition PlayStation 5 console with a copy of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latest entry in the popular action RPG franchise. With this bundle, buyers get a slim PlayStation 5 console with disc drive and a copy of Madden NFL 25, the latest game in the long-running football series. The PS VR2 is a virtual reality headset built for the PS5. It also supports a PC adapter (sold separately for $60) that can pair with computers to play SteamVR games. This bundle includes a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. These wireless earbuds are designed for gaming with a PS5 or PC. They support active noise cancellation and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for lag-free playback. This wired gaming headset has a white color scheme that's designed to match the PS5 console. It has a boom microphone for voice chat that can be flipped up to mute. You can now snag a Quest 3S bundle that includes the 128GB headset, the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and a three-month Meta Quest+ subscription for a total of $299. You can learn more about the 3S VR headset in our Meta Quest 3S review. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. PC and laptop gamers can save tons on new systems during Cyber Monday. Right now, the Asus TUG A15 gaming laptop is down to $999 which is just $20 more than the lowest price it's ever dipped to. We're also seeing great deals on monitors, like this 50% discount on Samsung's 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7. The Asus TUF is built with military-grade shock resistance, and its incredibly powerful battery can last for around nine hours on a single charge. This model of the X16 R2 by Asus has powerful specs to run almost any demanding game at high frames-per-second on its large 16-inch QHD 240Hz display. HP's Omen PCs are built for gamers, and this configuration features a great lower-midrange setup with an AMD Ryzen 7 8700G CPU, 6GB DDR5 Mmmory, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPU. Alienware's AW3225QF is the first 4K QD-OLED monitor and one of the few 4K displays you can get with a 240Hz refresh rate. It's expensive but delivers stunning performance while setting a new benchmark for gaming displays. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The Asus ROG Ally is a handheld gaming PC with Windows 11. Its hardware is powerful enough to run nearly any game, but its control issues make it awkward to use. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is an excellent choice for entry-level users, casual gamers, and those shopping on a budget. Despite being one of the most affordable wireless gaming mice on the market, it doesn't compromise quality or performance, and it's almost always on sale. See more of our Cyber Monday roundups The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful gaming consoles with similar graphical capabilities. However, they each have pros and cons. Our gaming experts think the PS5 has an edge in exclusive games, with franchises like Marvel's Spider-Man, The Last of Us, God of War, Ratchet & Clank, Astro Bot, and Ghosts of Tsushima that you can't play on Xbox systems. We also prefer the PS5's DualSense controller since it has extra perks like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Xbox consoles have their own exclusive titles as well, including Halo and Starfield, but the selection isn't as large and Microsoft is starting to experiment with releasing some of its first-party games on the PS5. However, the Xbox Series X has an edge in multimedia capabilities and its Game Pass subscription service, which offers tons of titles, including brand-new releases the day they launch in stores. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either system, but the PS5's exclusive titles and unique controller make it a slightly better option for gamers who don't want to miss out on big releases. Check out our PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison for more details. Top gaming PCs and laptops feature components built to handle modern games at stable frame rates, along with support for features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. This makes them notably more expensive than typical computers designed for everyday use. High-end gaming desktops and laptops can cost more than $3,000 but entry-level options with solid specifications can be found for around $800 to $1,000. When shopping for a gaming computer the most important spec to look at is the graphics card. Nvidia and AMD are the top brands in graphics cards, and they both sell excellent options. However, Nvidia's top GPUs are typically more powerful, and the company's RTX 40-series cards have a feature called "Deep Learning Super Sampling" (DLSS), which can improve frame rates with AI. Meanwhile, AMD's graphics cards tend to be a little less powerful by are also often less expensive. For the best gaming performance, we recommend focusing on PCs and laptops that have an Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card or higher. Shopping for more discounts today?

Title: ‘Very Promising Start’: Top Analyst Says Ethereum Headed Higher Against Bitcoin – Here Are His Targets

A top analyst who accurately called the end of the 2022 crypto bull market thinks Ethereum (ETH) is poised to rally in both its Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) and US dollar pairs. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 826,200 followers on the social media platform X that ETH/BTC looks good after respecting its support at 0.30 BTC. According to the crypto strategist, ETH/BTC may bounce to as high as 0.4597 BTC. “Very promising start. Let’s see if we can get to the target.” At time of writing, ETH/BTC is trading for 0.0373 BTC worth $3,563. As for Ethereum against the dollar, Pentoshi thinks it is within the realm of possibility for ETH to surge above $4,000. “No reason this doesn’t challenge this year’s highs, or higher in my opinion. Which likely has confluence with the ETH/BTC target posted.” He also thinks that the rally will be driven by investors allocating hundreds of millions of dollars in capital to ETH-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Starting to become more consistent for ETH. We could see a few $250-$500 million days at some point too in the near future for this [BlackRock ETH] ETF. Had a $91 million day just in the last week. Probability of that you have to assume is very high and not far stretched at all.” Pentoshi is also keeping a close watch on the native asset of the graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network Render (RENDER). The analyst says RENDER looks bullish after flipping a key resistance level at $8.10 as support. “Was a very short wait, RENDER flipped it, retested, and confirmed on the four-hour [chart]. Structurally a great looking chart.” At time of writing, RENDER is worth $8.61, up over 8% in the past day.

Title: How did Nvidia expand nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years?
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-jesen-huang-company-workforce-growth-stock-price-climbing-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-29T12:28:00Z

Good morning! Hallam Bullock here, once again writing to you from London. Black Friday is upon us and Business Insider's Reviews team has rounded up the best deals on the products and brands they swear by. In today's newsletter, we're looking at how Nvidia expanded nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A few years ago, Nvidia was largely unknown. It's difficult to believe, considering the company can now boast about back-to-back earnings beats, a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, and a stock price that has climbed nearly 200% over the past 12 months — Citi analysts also recently eyed a catalyst that could push the stock a further 27% by January. So, how can a company grow so much, so quickly? The data behind the evolution of Nvidia's workforce tells the story, BI's Emma Cosgrove writes. Nvidia's workforce has grown nearly 20-fold since 2003. Beyond its historic rise in market value, this growth has been aided by a slew of employee incentives, including a futuristic headquarters that reflects the company's "no barriers and no boundaries" philosophy (it's easy to see why they named the building "Voyager"). This workforce growth continued through 2024, a particularly brutal year for the Tech industry, during which time Meta and Google made significant cuts. It's one of the best-paying firms in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Microsoft's median employee salary was nearly $20,000 higher than a Nvidia worker. As of January 2024, Nvidia's median salary (excluding the CEO) had surpassed Microsoft and reached more than $220,000. As the above chart illustrates, it's also left other tech giants in the dust. Nvidia's revenue per employee has recovered after years of investment. The company's revenue-to-headcount ratio showed a downward trend from 2003 until 2014, and then steady upward progress until the AI boom in 2023. During that year, this ratio doubled. This is in part due to early investment in building a programming software layer called CUDA — the main element that keeps AI builders from easily switching to competing hardware. However, the company isn't as far ahead in other areas. Gender representation in the company's workforce and the semiconductor industry as a whole has remained relatively unchanged in the last decade, Emma writes.

Major difference with Marandi above. Marandi before had stressed that Iran had had to hold its fire while Gaza ceasefire talks were on so as not to be charged with being a spoiler. The US has played up the idea that Gaza ceasefire talks are again on after the Lebanon ceasefire. So those may need to die out before Iran strikes again.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically. A more granular take: What is happening with the ruble? The ruble has experienced the most significant rate of devaluation since August 2023.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him. Irony is I’m probably not his least liked member of my family after my mum wrote rude stuff about him on Facebook within weeks of voting for him at the general election. All fun and games in this very marginal constituency! His track record proves he is all in for the kill https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-winter-fuel-allowance-pensioners-b2611986.html When did this phrase “assisted dying” get chosen as the message. Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Does one want a “chastened” NATO either? For whom egos could well be strategic assets? Rump Ukraine > Occupied Rump Ukraine. Who cares how they decorate? If they get testy, Russia just goes Grozny and rewilds Galicia. The next generation of Russian soldiers could use a boogeyman that isn’t actually dropping bombs on them at bedtime, also cold war economy go brrrrtttt. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going, laughing maniacally through the depression and snow until sometime in May. Lol, my version includes whiskey and maybe a re-read of Blood Meridian. My wife is very susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder while I hardly notice it at all. Mind you I haven’t ever lived north of Quebec City. Nothing weak about taking Vitamin D supplements…you don’t even have to wear pants! Yep. Remember when the Chilean trapped miners were supplied with water, food, and vitamin D, specifically, while waiting for their eventual rescue? There was a reason for that. / ;) https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna39000893 Nordic diet, oddly enough, is full of salmon, milk and eggs. Have lived here decades, never taken Vitamin D supplements. Also helps to have a fair skin tone. I am male and have lived on the coast of Alaska most of my adult life. Dont always wear pants. Winter is when i head into the woodshop crank the heat and the tunes crack a beer and start creating something. Spring comes all too soon it seems. When the sun does come out you go for a walk. Sometimes end up with the geezers at local watering hole. Good ideas start there sometimes. I know i live a blessed life. Being a member of AFDU (Alaska functional drunkards union local chapter 86). You cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning. Cheers. I once saw a funny text describing how to determine the temperature without resorting to a graded thermometer. Everything was based on what people from various countries (supposedly) do when the weather becomes colder and colder. Clues such as “Finns finally close the windows before going to sleep”, or “Even your Volvo helps you plan the trip to Tunisia” and the like.

I got around the dark and wet by going on bike rides in the wet and cold. It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them!

A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles. See also the medieval Christian hospitallers (from whence comes the modern hospital idea) of charities care for the ill. Throw the ill outside the town’s gate to die, or care for them as our fellow humans. I haven’t seen any evidence of actual oversight in Canada.

Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless. The interviewer here (Ali Alizadeh) said that there are reports that there are 10,000 Turks fighting for Israel in Gaza. The u of houston professor Fadi Kafeety did not comment on that specifically. How Yemen Became a Rising Power in West Asia? A Conversation with Fadi Kafeety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIR2TIHljU has anyone else heard anything about that? If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get. Harris losing was a small victory but this is the main risk for our future as a species. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W).

See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.” And this is precisely Ms. Roy’s undertaking as, throughout her book, she shuttles between the twins’ past and present, continually angling in, crabwise, toward the night of Sophie Mol’s death…. https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/books/melodrama-as-structure-for-subtlety.html June 3, 1997 Melodrama as Structure for Subtlety By MICHIKO KAKUTANI THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS By Arundhati Roy ”The God of Small Things,” Arundhati Roy’s dazzling first novel, begins as a sort of mystery story. What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity. Kalaripayattu. Kerala is the most lovely part of India imho. I’ve been going to India on holiday almost every year for 20 years or so, because I love it so much. Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about. (alas) Vikas, I very much appreciate the analysis and always will, but what I hope for most is that you be well. As for me, jogging or walking daily, whether I want to or not, * seems to keep me fit. * I never want to, but almost never miss.

Evidence for Biological Age Acceleration and Telomere Shortening in COVID-19 Survivors I’m remembering from early in the pandemic the idea that getting covid aged you ten years was a topic of discussion here. Good times. Yes, same-same with clotting. And the spike. This site is prophylactic against morbidity. Interesting was recently diagnosed with atrial arrhythmia and have an electrophysiology consult in a couple of weeks. Never had Covid (that I know of) and not vaxed. So just another random data point signifying nothing. “Hope lies with Ursula” One would think, or hope, that as a former defense minister, EC President von der Leyen would demonstrate a significant grasp of what’s happening in Ukraine and what’s at stake as the war escalates. Is there any evidence for that belief? “Xi sits in Beijing. In Moscow, Putin. In Washington, Trump is on the way. You can call them crazy guys. They don’t want good.

Ultimate Irony Comes as Taliban Asks Russia’s Help To Evade US Sanctions, Closing 50-year Loop of Violence Antiwar.com (Kevin W) The US had spent billions arming freedom fighters to fight the Russians out of Afghanistan, … No it didn’t. US had intentionaly spent gazillions arming extremists of all sorts all around the world, knowing very well what they are, and rebranding them as freedom fighters in order to sell the lie to idi*ts. If the Russians manage to bring Afghanistan in from the cold like they are doing for North Korea, then maybe that country can develop all those mineral reserves that the Pentagon tried to use to justify the occupation and rebuild their country. Just don’t forget the real reason why the occupation- https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1547752702511263745 I once read an interview of a warlord from the Northern Alliance which I hope I had bookmarked, but no such luck, so I have no proof. But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

That’s a danger, baby, bathwater. But here’s a start: : Left/Right is historically accurate, since the Left was where the Third Estate sat during the National Assembly, and it was dominated by lawyers, not workers. What was, now is. : Taleb: Never use terms such as progressive or conservative without reference to a rate of change Progressive and conservative are ill defined terms, verbalistic labels. It is required to specify a rate of change for every specific domain. Rationally progressive means embracing progress by accepting a certain rate of change deemed optimal. Too high a rate of change cancels the gains from previous mutations; while too slow a change leads to misfitness. : Pandit, Pradhan, & van Schaik: Figure 6 shows the number of feasible classes as a function of the skew in power, σ, and the original group size, N(0). … the number of feasible classes has a very weak dependence on group size. Thus, for the N(0) in the typical range of human group sizes, the number of classes only depends on σ. Intriguingly, at lower σ we expect to find more classes… The size of the upper class is largest for σ → 0 (~ half of the group), thus potentially leading to a large number of middle classes. Power. That’s a word Fazi doesn’t hone in on. Rather applicable to the tremendous wealth inequality of an oligarchy. Thanks.

Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based. On checking novel’s origin , some stats in storyline: Set in mid 1999-New Years day 2000, World population ~7B (seemingly indicative of extreme overpopulation!) and NYC 34M. Food shortage driven by resource hoarding by rich is a major factor in social upheaval . Euthanasia becomes a protein source… Never gonna Happen! Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from. However, I did have a New Year’s party in Dec 2022 which nearly ruined a thirty year friendship group when it turned out that two of us (me + gold trader) took Russia’s side and two of us (particle physics professor and healthcare informatics / pandemic data analysis PhD) took the Ukraine’s. We were shocked by their fact-free convictions. We have agreed not to speak of it again! Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China. This looks like it’s going to be a case of dog catching car. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/europe/uk-assisted-dying-bill-vote.html November 29, 2024 After Emotional Debate, British Lawmakers Vote to Legalize Assisted Dying In a landmark decision on Friday, Parliament voted in favor of allowing assisted suicide for some terminally ill people under strict conditions. By Stephen Castle [ Seemingly explaining why Labour has shown no legislative interest in strengthening the public health service. No wonder why Jeremy Corbyn had to be expelled from Labour. ] It seems that rational people with increasingly painful, progressive and handicapping chronic illnesses which are not in themselves terminal will still be forced to commit suicide without the support of friends or family. Seems that Parliament is addicted to short measure The British legislation may be a first step. In Canada where we have had Medically Assistance in Dying (MAID) for a number of years there have been a variety of steps allowing people suffering greatly with no hope of recovery the relief of MAID. About 7500 people avail themselves of this merciful way of leaving their suffering behind, able to leave this world in the company of loved ones. I’m 72 and fully support the legislation. The British people overwhelmingly support the legislation as shown by a poll published in The Independent yesterday. The support is greatest among those over 55. re: Oreshnik orbital weapon as explained by the villain in “G.I.

A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this. One thing I keep in mind about the “Collective Biden” is that the husk alone has had Covid 3 times, Dr Jill has had it several times and Blinken, Sullivan and the rest have had it several times as well. This may have something to do with why the USA is now in a shooting War with Russia and it does not bode well for the future. Maybe we’ll get lucky… This was also reported by TASS but no sign in mainstream media in the states… https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/28/886216.html “Up to 40 specialists from the USA were destroyed”: The Ministry of Defense revealed details of the retaliatory strike against Ukraine The Ministry of Defense told what losses the Ukrainian side suffered after Russia’s retaliatory strike against attacks with long-range ATACMS missiles. According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun! It is a monster which will either remain subservient to the US, or will gradually implode and it’s members will part company with each other, or both; or it could simply recognise reality and either implode or remains in some form as abstract in it’s realty as it’s model, the Holy Roman Empire, accepting that it is the inferior in terms of it’s relationships with Russia and China – on whom it is dependent if it’s inhabitants are to enjoy a standard of living anywhere approaching the standard they enjoy today which, of course, for most people means a standard lower than that of 2021. Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC. The port of Chabahar in Iran is where it will start. This looks set to be an interesting corner of the world as the near future unfolds. I’m looking forward to watching how things develop.

Major difference with Marandi above. Marandi before had stressed that Iran had had to hold its fire while Gaza ceasefire talks were on so as not to be charged with being a spoiler. The US has played up the idea that Gaza ceasefire talks are again on after the Lebanon ceasefire. So those may need to die out before Iran strikes again.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically. A more granular take: What is happening with the ruble? The ruble has experienced the most significant rate of devaluation since August 2023. Compared to the dollar, it has reached lows not seen since mid-March 2022. It's currently trading at 108.1 rubles per USD.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him. Irony is I’m probably not his least liked member of my family after my mum wrote rude stuff about him on Facebook within weeks of voting for him at the general election. All fun and games in this very marginal constituency! His track record proves he is all in for the kill https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-winter-fuel-allowance-pensioners-b2611986.html When did this phrase “assisted dying” get chosen as the message. Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Does one want a “chastened” NATO either? For whom egos could well be strategic assets? Rump Ukraine > Occupied Rump Ukraine. Who cares how they decorate? If they get testy, Russia just goes Grozny and rewilds Galicia. The next generation of Russian soldiers could use a boogeyman that isn’t actually dropping bombs on them at bedtime, also cold war economy go brrrrtttt. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going, laughing maniacally through the depression and snow until sometime in May. Lol, my version includes whiskey and maybe a re-read of Blood Meridian. My wife is very susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder while I hardly notice it at all. Mind you I haven’t ever lived north of Quebec City. Nothing weak about taking Vitamin D supplements…you don’t even have to wear pants! Yep. Remember when the Chilean trapped miners were supplied with water, food, and vitamin D, specifically, while waiting for their eventual rescue? There was a reason for that. / ;) https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna39000893 Nordic diet, oddly enough, is full of salmon, milk and eggs. Have lived here decades, never taken Vitamin D supplements. Also helps to have a fair skin tone. I am male and have lived on the coast of Alaska most of my adult life. Dont always wear pants. Winter is when i head into the woodshop crank the heat and the tunes crack a beer and start creating something. Spring comes all too soon it seems. When the sun does come out you go for a walk. Sometimes end up with the geezers at local watering hole. Good ideas start there sometimes. I know i live a blessed life. Being a member of AFDU (Alaska functional drunkards union local chapter 86). You cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning. Cheers. I once saw a funny text describing how to determine the temperature without resorting to a graded thermometer. Everything was based on what people from various countries (supposedly) do when the weather becomes colder and colder. Clues such as “Finns finally close the windows before going to sleep”, or “Even your Volvo helps you plan the trip to Tunisia” and the like. The real men, wearing pants, leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM&t=6s I lived in Seattle for 35 years. I got around the dark and wet by going on bike rides in the wet and cold. It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them! The picture was most probably generated. Even the HTTP link looks like a prompt: “a-butterfly-with-orange-and-black-wings-on-a-beige-background”. Looks like a photo of a gift shop trinket. If you follow the “via” link, it states quite clearly that it is a 3d render, i.e. a drawing done on a computer. A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles.

Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless. The interviewer here (Ali Alizadeh) said that there are reports that there are 10,000 Turks fighting for Israel in Gaza. The u of houston professor Fadi Kafeety did not comment on that specifically.

If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get.

How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? Because they have a letter of marque. A Freedom of Anchoring exercise? Not a Coastie, but there are various authorities for boarding. See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.” And this is precisely Ms. Roy’s undertaking as, throughout her book, she shuttles between the twins’ past and present, continually angling in, crabwise, toward the night of Sophie Mol’s death…. https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/books/melodrama-as-structure-for-subtlety.html June 3, 1997 Melodrama as Structure for Subtlety By MICHIKO KAKUTANI THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS By Arundhati Roy ”The God of Small Things,” Arundhati Roy’s dazzling first novel, begins as a sort of mystery story. What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity. Kalaripayattu. Kerala is the most lovely part of India imho. I’ve been going to India on holiday almost every year for 20 years or so, because I love it so much. Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about.

Hope lies with von der Leyen in Brussels.” Absurd and offensive.

Ultimate Irony Comes as Taliban Asks Russia’s Help To Evade US Sanctions, Closing 50-year Loop of Violence Antiwar.com (Kevin W) The US had spent billions arming freedom fighters to fight the Russians out of Afghanistan, … No it didn’t. US had intentionaly spent gazillions arming extremists of all sorts all around the world, knowing very well what they are, and rebranding them as freedom fighters in order to sell the lie to idi*ts. If the Russians manage to bring Afghanistan in from the cold like they are doing for North Korea, then maybe that country can develop all those mineral reserves that the Pentagon tried to use to justify the occupation and rebuild their country. Just don’t forget the real reason why the occupation- https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1547752702511263745 I once read an interview of a warlord from the Northern Alliance which I hope I had bookmarked, but no such luck, so I have no proof. But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

What was, now is. : Taleb: Never use terms such as progressive or conservative without reference to a rate of change Progressive and conservative are ill defined terms, verbalistic labels. It is required to specify a rate of change for every specific domain. Rationally progressive means embracing progress by accepting a certain rate of change deemed optimal. Too high a rate of change cancels the gains from previous mutations; while too slow a change leads to misfitness. : Pandit, Pradhan, & van Schaik: Figure 6 shows the number of feasible classes as a function of the skew in power, σ, and the original group size, N(0). … the number of feasible classes has a very weak dependence on group size. Thus, for the N(0) in the typical range of human group sizes, the number of classes only depends on σ. Intriguingly, at lower σ we expect to find more classes… The size of the upper class is largest for σ → 0 (~ half of the group), thus potentially leading to a large number of middle classes. Power. That’s a word Fazi doesn’t hone in on. Rather applicable to the tremendous wealth inequality of an oligarchy. Thanks.

Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based.

Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from. However, I did have a New Year’s party in Dec 2022 which nearly ruined a thirty year friendship group when it turned out that two of us (me + gold trader) took Russia’s side and two of us (particle physics professor and healthcare informatics / pandemic data analysis PhD) took the Ukraine’s. We were shocked by their fact-free convictions. We have agreed not to speak of it again! Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China.

In Canada where we have had Medically Assistance in Dying (MAID) for a number of years there have been a variety of steps allowing people suffering greatly with no hope of recovery the relief of MAID. About 7500 people avail themselves of this merciful way of leaving their suffering behind, able to leave this world in the company of loved ones. I’m 72 and fully support the legislation. The British people overwhelmingly support the legislation as shown by a poll published in The Independent yesterday. The support is greatest among those over 55. re: Oreshnik orbital weapon as explained by the villain in “G.I.

It seems my government is really committed to WW3: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/29/abandoning-ukraine-infinitely-higher-costs-head-of-mi6 When a minimizer of the ongoing Pandemic is worried about H5N1, that is a sight to behold. A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this. One thing I keep in mind about the “Collective Biden” is that the husk alone has had Covid 3 times, Dr Jill has had it several times and Blinken, Sullivan and the rest have had it several times as well. This may have something to do with why the USA is now in a shooting War with Russia and it does not bode well for the future. Maybe we’ll get lucky… This was also reported by TASS but no sign in mainstream media in the states… https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/28/886216.html “Up to 40 specialists from the USA were destroyed”: The Ministry of Defense revealed details of the retaliatory strike against Ukraine The Ministry of Defense told what losses the Ukrainian side suffered after Russia’s retaliatory strike against attacks with long-range ATACMS missiles. According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun! It is a monster which will either remain subservient to the US, or will gradually implode and it’s members will part company with each other, or both; or it could simply recognise reality and either implode or remains in some form as abstract in it’s realty as it’s model, the Holy Roman Empire, accepting that it is the inferior in terms of it’s relationships with Russia and China – on whom it is dependent if it’s inhabitants are to enjoy a standard of living anywhere approaching the standard they enjoy today which, of course, for most people means a standard lower than that of 2021. Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC. The port of Chabahar in Iran is where it will start. This looks set to be an interesting corner of the world as the near future unfolds. I’m looking forward to watching how things develop.

Title: Amazon employees are ‘rage-applying’ as its return-to-office mandate looms—experts say that’s exactly what CEO Andy Jassy wants

Amazon’s return-to-office policy announced in September, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, has workers irritated. Some have even begun “rage-applying” to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them: that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for. The tech mammoth’s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future-of-work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company’s own talent and tech advancements. “Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,” Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider. The company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025’s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its headcount. Brian Elliott, future-of-work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will “undoubtedly” see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers. “The vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,” he said. “And, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.” A study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy’s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate. These “backdoor layoffs,” as Bloom refers to them, have already made a splash in other workplaces. According to research by BambooHR published in May surveying over 1,500 U.S. managers, about a quarter of executives said they hoped employees would voluntarily leave the company after the implementation of an RTO mandate. When AT&T mandated its 60,000 workers across nine of its 350 offices work in person again, some employees interpreted the push as a way to eliminate workers unable or uninterested in relocating to their offices. CEO John Stankey estimated that 15% of the affected workforce, about 9,000 employees, would face the choice of relocating or leaving the company altogether. “It’s a layoff wolf in return-to-office sheep’s clothing,” an anonymous AT&T employee told Bloomberg. The sneaky layoff strategy hasn’t always worked out for employers. Almost half of employers that implemented RTO policies saw a greater than anticipated level of employee attrition, according to a 2023 report from Unispace. Almost 30% reported recruitment difficulties. Amazon will face this same risk, Elliott argued. Other tech companies may keep their flexible work policies as a means to poach Amazon’s talent, and Amazon may struggle to hire new faces, he said. This talent pool shrinks even more for women, who may need flexibility for child care, and managers, who can leverage experience to find a cushier job elsewhere. “You lose a set of people in your organization,” Elliott said. “You lose high performance.” A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on October 2, 2024. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone, or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Cyber Monday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Cyber Monday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Cyber Monday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Save money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads.

You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. However, there are some discounts on previous models: U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Cyber Monday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85 percent (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75 percent off at $1.99 a month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is offering subscriptions for $8 a month, 50 percent off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV+, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-day trial or even Apple’s 3 months for free if you buy an Apple product. In fact, there are even some Cyber Monday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it.

"The U.S market will continue to do well. As you know, tech has already done well. So, what I would do is focus on companies and industries that are taking advantage of technology to improve productivity," the chairman of the Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund said in an interview with CNBC last week. U.S.-based companies geared toward China and India, as well as other major emerging market economies, are well positioned, he added. "I focus on those companies that are global in their scope, and producing and exporting and selling in these countries, because that's where the growth will be." Investors should also consider firms taking advantage of what Mobius calls "accelerated information," such as chip manufacturers. "I call AI accelerated information because there's nothing artificial about AI and it's not intelligent. But it's getting more information faster and being able to analyze that information much more effectively," he said. His comments come as emerging markets that produce semiconductors enjoy an economic boom, with Taiwan — which makes most of the advanced chips in circulation — a particular success story. ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia are also enjoying increased foreign investment. Malaysia's focus on chip production, for instance, has seen it become deeply embedded into the global supply chain. Speaking with CNBC at the October IMF annual meetings in Washington, D.C., Malaysia's central bank governor Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour said the country exports 7% of the world's semiconductors. Mobius says there's "no question" that a tech bubble is on the horizon given the valuations of the so-called Magnificent Seven — a group of Big Tech stocks comprising of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. But although he admitted that some of stock prices had "gone up too fast and too far," he's not concerned. "You must remember that you can't just look at the price-to-earnings ratio, which is the normal measure that people use to evaluate whether an industry or a stock is too expensive, because the growth rate of these companies is so great," he said. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, with its next-generation AI chip Blackwell now in focus. Shares of the company have nearly tripled so far in 2024 — up more than 170% in the year-to-date — making it the world's most valuable publicly traded company. Some investors worry the AI juggernaut won't be able to keep up the rapid growth, however, although Mobius remains optimistic about the prospects for Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks. "The [Magnificent Seven] earnings are growing at a terrific pace and you've got to look forward that will continue. I'm not so concerned about most of these companies being too expensive, they will continue to do quite well," Mobius added. "And of course, you have new companies coming into the picture that are also benefiting from these changes." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Andy Farrell hoping Ireland have kept their best performance until last against Australia

Whether the provinces see it this way or not is a moot point, but Ireland are in bonus territory this weekend with the addition of a fourth Autumn Nations Series game against Australia, or at any rate it will be very much a bonus if they keep their best performance until last against Joe Schmidt’s team. That is what Andy Farrell most wants before heading off on his sabbatical with the British & Irish Lions. “Our best performance of the autumn and maybe more, hopefully,” said the Irish head coach after announcing a side which sees the return of Hugo Keenan, James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park, Ronan Kelleher and James Ryan, as well as the retention of Sam Prendergast at outhalf. “That’s what you’re always wishing for, isn’t it, to progress? Australia are certainly progressing. We feel that the occasion, the importance of it, everything that we put on, trying to kick on in any type of series, is enough for us to see the best of ourselves.” Farrell loves maximising landmarks and there’ll be no shortage of them on Saturday at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm), what with Cian Healy reaching the Irish record of 134 caps off the bench and this game part of the IRFU’s 150th anniversary celebrations. “It’s huge, it’s a huge privilege for us all. We’ve Ollie Campbell coming in this evening (Thursday) presenting the one-off jerseys we’re going to use. They’re beautiful jerseys, aren’t they? Very nice,” added Farrell dutifully of the retro commemorative jerseys which went on sale this week and will be worn against the Wallabies. Campbell is the perfect fit, not only as a top bloke and great player, but he captained the Belvedere College team that won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup in 1972, while Healy was part of the 2005 Belvedere team which beat Blackrock to bridge a 33-year gap. “It’s a privilege for us because we talk about our history a lot in this type of position when it comes around on our shift. The 150th anniversary is a special place for us, and then you combine it with what’s happening there with Cian. “What a story, playing his debut 15 years ago against Australia,” said Farrell in reference to Healy’s debut in a 20-20 draw against Australia at Croke Park in November 2009. “It’s fitting for both the union and for Cian and his family. So (it is) a privileged-type situation for us all to be involved.” While the return of five frontliners was significant the retention of the 21-year-old Prendergast for a second successive start is the headline selection ahead of Jack Crowley, who has to be content with a return to the bench after starting all nine post-World Cup Tests prior to last week’s win over Fiji. Gus McCarthy has been preferred on the bench to Rob Herring, as is Craig Casey ahead of Conor Murray, while Peter O’Mahony and Garry Ringrose return to complete the ‘23′. While Prendergast’s selection was perhaps a less risky punt in the final game of a November window, Farrell saw this as a decision based on merit in the here and now. “This isn’t just throwing someone in and hoping to get the best out of it. I think he’s deserved it a little bit but also there’s obviously an eye on (the future). I suppose with the two young lads, this game won’t define them. It’ll be a good part of their development, and that’s what you’re hoping for.” Though one suspects both men are probably a tad weary of the narrative and line of questioning, Farrell said he welcomed the storyline of Schmidt returning to these shores for the first time as an opposing head coach. Praising what Schmidt achieved with Leinster and Ireland as “phenomenal”, Farrell added: “He’s the most successful coach in Irish rugby when you look at his time overall in Dublin. We’ve got a lot to thank him about, and I think it’s a nice story that we get to celebrate this game alongside him.” Farrell thanked Schmidt and David Nucifora for first hiring him as defence coach after the 2016 Six Nations and for the “privilege” of working with him. He also admitted that Schmidt’s “DNA was all over” the All Blacks’ World Cup quarter-final win when their assistant coach. “We’ve been here a little bit before, but when he comes back to these shores he should be celebrated for everything that he’s done for Irish rugby.” Farrell also spoke of cementing the foundations left by Schmidt and adding to them. “Whatever is good we keep cultivating that and keep allowing that to grow, and then I suppose you deal with things in a way that’s true to yourself, the direction of the game that you want to play, and the personnel that you’ve got to play it.” Farrell will miss next year’s Six Nations as well as a three-game summer tour to Georgia, Portugal and one more, but has compartmentalised both roles. “The only thing that drives me on is planning for the future of this team and that’s only been at the forefront of my mind, certainly over the last six months anyway.” Regardless of the result against Australia, Ireland will still be seeking to become the first country to win three Six Nations’ titles in a row next year, and Farrell understandably believes that passing the baton to Simon Easterby will ensure the smoothest transition. “We’ve been working together long enough now to agree on how this team needs to be driven forward. All our ideas over the years, that will continue. Simon is unbelievably diligent and the right man for the role in leading from the front. We’ve had the experience there and we’ve seen the credentials there, and we know it’s going to be a seamless one.” Ireland: Hugo Keenan; Mack Hansen, Robbie Henshaw, Bundee Aki, James Lowe; Sam Prendergast, Jamison Gibson-Park; Andrew Porter, Rónan Kelleher, Finlay Bealham, Joe McCarthy, James Ryan, Tadhg Beirne, Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris. Replacements: Gus McCarthy, Cian Healy, Tom O’Toole, Iain Henderson, Peter O’Mahony, Craig Casey, Jack Crowley, Garry Ringrose. Australia: T Wright, A Kellaway, J Suaalii, L Ikitau, M Jorgensen; N Lolesio, J Gordon; J Slipper, B Paenga-Amosa, T Tupou; N Frost, J Williams; R Valetini, F McReight, H Wilson (capt).

The Sensex and Nifty showed modest gains, with investors closely monitoring multiple economic signals and institutional movements. The Sensex opened marginally lower at 79,032.99 from its previous close of 79,043.74 but has moved up, trading at 79,402.52 as of 9.52 AM, gaining 358.78 points or 0.45 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty opened slightly higher at 23,927.15 compared to its previous close of 23,914.15 and is currently at 24,034.20, rising by 120.05 points or 0.50 per cent. The National Stock Exchange introduced F&O contracts for 45 new stocks across diverse sectors, including finance, technology, and renewable energy. Notable additions include Indian Bank, Union Bank, LIC, Cyient, KPIT Technologies, Adani Green Energy, DMart, and Zomato. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) displayed significant selling pressure, offloading equities worth ₹11,756 crore on November 28, contrasting with Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) who were net buyers, purchasing equities worth ₹8,718 crore. “A perplexing market action in recent days is the inexplicable volatility in FII activity,” said Dr V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “A few days of buying followed by yesterday’s massive selling is difficult to explain.” Sector-specific movements were prominent. Banking stocks showed potential positive traction due to improved deposit growth, with credit growth slowing to 11.15 per cent year-on-year, while deposit growth slightly exceeded at 11.21 per cent, according to RBI data. The insurance sector attracted attention as the government proposed raising Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) limits from 74 per cent to 100 per cent, potentially opening up new investment opportunities. Top gainers included pharmaceutical stocks, with Sun Pharma (1.77 per cent), Cipla (1.75 per cent), and Dr Reddy’s (1.68 per cent) leading the pack. Mahindra & Mahindra (1.36 per cent) and Adani Ports (1.23 per cent) also showed positive momentum. Conversely, power and utility stocks faced challenges, with Power Grid experiencing a 1.54 per cent decline. Shriram Finance (-0.37 per cent), Coal India (-0.36 per cent), ITC (-0.27 per cent), and Tech Mahindra (-0.16 per cent) were among the top losers. “The market is expected to open on a flat note due to concerns over FII selling and a weak start in Asian markets,” noted Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities. “Asian indices dropped by up to 2 per cent following inflation data from Japan that exceeded expectations.” Technical analysts highlighted critical market levels. “Immediate support is placed at 23,800 and 23,680, which align with strong Fibonacci levels,” explained Mandar Bhojane from Choice Broking. “On the upside, 24,350 serves as immediate resistance.” Global factors continued to influence market sentiment, including ongoing concerns about US inflation, potential tariff threats, and uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate policies. Market participants are advised to remain cautious and monitor sector-specific movements, with particular attention to banking, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks. The market’s trajectory remains uncertain, with investors and analysts closely watching upcoming economic indicators and global economic developments.

Title: Bitcoin surpasses 2015-2018 cycle – Is $100K ATH next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-surpasses-2015-2018-cycle-is-100k-ath-next/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T03:00:18Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin has surpassed the 2015-2018 cycle, sparking more discussion about the potential for $100K. Bitcoin [BTC] has surged past a critical price milestone — surpassing key resistance levels that previously defined its cyclical behavior during the 2015-2018 bull market. This latest breakout highlights the cryptocurrency’s resilience and growing maturity in a market that has evolved significantly since its early speculative days. Unlike the dramatic peaks and valleys of the 2015-2018 cycle, Bitcoin’s current trajectory appears more measured, underpinned by stronger fundamentals and broader adoption. With its price now exceeding levels that many believed would act as insurmountable resistance, questions arise about whether this surge marks the beginning of a new bull cycle — or even a run toward a six-figure valuation. Bitcoin’s current cycle is progressing faster than its 2015-2018 counterpart. After peaking at $20,000 in 2017, Bitcoin took nearly three years to recover, consolidating at lower levels before its next bull run. In contrast, the 2022 bottom has been followed by a much quicker rebound, with Bitcoin surpassing $50,000 within two years — nearly a year faster than the previous recovery. Source: TradingView The chart shows Bitcoin maintaining momentum, with monthly RSI readings above 75 signaling strong bullish conditions. Trading volumes have also exceeded those from the earlier cycle, reflecting increased market participation. This milestone represents an 80% recovery from 2022 lows, supported by long-term holder accumulation and reduced exchange balances. These on-chain shifts highlight stronger fundamentals compared to prior cycles, suggesting less speculative activity and more sustained growth. Bitcoin’s accelerated recovery sets it apart from historical patterns. Two key factors define this cycle: institutional adoption and macroeconomic tailwinds. Major players like BlackRock and Fidelity are pushing for Bitcoin ETFs, signaling mainstream acceptance and driving capital inflows. Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures has surged, reflecting heightened institutional activity. On the macroeconomic front, persistent inflation, geopolitical instability, and de-dollarization trends are bolstering Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge. Additionally, advancements like the Lightning Network have improved scalability, enhancing Bitcoin’s utility. These dynamics, absent in earlier cycles, are fueling stronger and more sustainable demand, positioning Bitcoin as a maturing asset in both retail and institutional markets. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s recent price movement, coupled with strong on-chain fundamentals, makes $100K a real possibility. Bitcoin surged past $90K in November, with a notable increase in trading volume and RSI hitting 75, suggesting robust bullish momentum. The correction that followed has seen Bitcoin hold steady around $95K, maintaining a healthy RSI of 65, indicating that the market is not yet overbought. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 The ongoing institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors, such as inflation concerns and growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs, further support the bullish outlook.

Title: The Bambu Lab A1 Mini Changed My Opinion About 3D Printing
URL: https://www.maketecheasier.com/review/bambu-lab-a1-mini/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T01:25:00Z

Sign up for our daily newsletter I’ve watched way too many friends wrestle with 3D printers – endless calibration processes and hours of print settings tweaking just to get a half-decent result. It all seemed like way more trouble than it was worth, and for years, that kept me from even considering buying one myself. But then I discovered the Bambu Lab A1 Mini, and everything changed. When I spotted the Bambu Lab A1 Mini on sale for $200, my interest was immediately piqued by the promise of a plug-and-print experience with high-quality output right out of the box. This hassle-free experience is made possible by a suite of intelligent features that eliminate the typical frustrations of 3D printing. The entire calibration process is fully automated thanks to a network of sensors: it measures the bed level, sets the perfect Z-offset, calibrates the belt tension, and even fine-tunes the vibration compensation before each print. There’s also the Active Flow Rate Compensation system, which actively measures and adjusts the pressure in the nozzle as it prints to eliminate common headaches like blobby corners or inconsistent layers. The compact size was another selling point. At just 347 x 315 x 365 mm, the Bambu Lab A1 Mini has almost exactly the right size for my modest desk setup. Sure, its 180 x 180 x 180 mm build volume isn’t the largest out there, but it’s more than adequate for most of my home printing needs. It’s worth noting that the Bambu Lab also offers an optional A1 Mini-compatible AMS (Automatic Material System) for multi-color printing, but I decided to skip it. As cool as multi-color prints look, the process requires frequent purging of filament when switching colors, which creates a lot of waste. Since my needs for multi-color prints are pretty limited, I couldn’t justify the extra cost and material waste. Convinced that the A1 Mini is worth the price, I placed my order through Bambu Lab’s European store on a Wednesday evening. After a week that felt much longer than usual – thanks to my growing excitement and endless YouTube reviews – a box arrived at my doorstep, and I was ready to unbox my new printer. The A1 Mini came pre-assembled – a welcome departure from the DIY kits I’d watched friends struggle with – and the setup process was refreshingly straightforward. After placing the printer on my desk and removing a few pieces of protective foam, I just needed to attach the spool holder and plug it in. The touchscreen interface walked me through each step with clear instructions that actually made sense. Loading the included sample filament was equally intuitive. The printer guided me through the process on its 2.4-inch touchscreen: insert the filament until the sensor detects it, then tap “Load.” The printer handled everything else automatically, heating up the nozzle and feeding the filament through. When plastic emerged from the nozzle, I knew I was ready to print. Then came the moment of truth: my first Benchy, the little 3D printed tugboat that serves as a standard test print across the 3D printing community. The printer confidently ran through its pre-print calibration routine, checking everything from bed level to belt tension. Then it started printing at a speed that made me nervous – until I saw the results. About 20 minutes later (this includes the time it took the printer to complete its calibration routines), I was holding a nearly perfect Benchy. The layers were clean, the overhangs were smooth, and even the tiny details like the door arch and window frames came out crisp. No stringing, no layer shifts, and no elephant’s foot at the base. Like most major manufacturers of 3D printers, Bambu providers its own slicer software, called Bambu Studio. Those familiar with PrusaSlicer will find Bambu Studio to be instantly familiar, and for a good reason: it’s a direct fork. Indeed, Bambu Lab has taken the well-loved PrusaSlicer framework and enhanced it with features tailored specifically for their printers, such as seamless integration with the AMS system for multi-material printing and optimized profiles for high-speed, high-quality results. Bambu Lab’s own slicer software impressed me from the start with its clean interface and intelligent default settings, but I soon discovered OrcaSlicer (a fork of Bambu Studio) after seeing it repeatedly recommended in online communities. While OrcaSlicer’s standout advantage is its superior compatibility with non-Bambu printers, I personally use it from time to time mainly because it supports some advance print settings that Bambu Studio doesn’t. For instance, I often find myself turning to OrcaSlicer specifically for its mouse ears brim feature – small circular additions to the brim that provide extra adhesion exactly where needed. Like many new 3D printer owners, I needed a practical project to justify the purchase to my skeptical spouse, and our Ikea sofa provided one. You see, it’s low-profile legs created a black hole for toys – anything that rolled under it was effectively lost until our next major furniture-moving cleaning session. This was my chance. Using TinkerCAD (a free, browser-based 3D modeling tool), I designed a set of sleeve-like adapters that could slide over the sofa’s legs while providing mounting points for a wooden barrier. The print took a few hours using Bambu’s black PLA filament, and the results exceeded my expectations. The adapters fit perfectly, and now our living room floor stays toy-free. Encouraged by this success, I started looking for other household challenges to tackle. A broken dishwasher soap dispenser clip? Printed a replacement in 30 minutes. Our oddly-sized shower drain that no standard plug would fit? Designed and printed a custom solution that works better than anything we could have bought. But I have to admit, while practical projects justified the purchase, toys for my kids make up the bulk of my printing these days. This is where Bambu Lab’s MakerWorld website has become an invaluable resource. It’s a community platform that hosts thousands of 3D models, many with pre-configured print profiles specifically optimized for the A1 Mini. My kids have been particularly delighted with the custom Duplo-compatible bricks I’ve printed. The adapters that let them connect their Duplo blocks to wooden Brio train tracks were an instant hit. We’ve also printed specialized pieces like a working crane tower, custom railway switches, and even a replica John Deere tractor in perfect Duplo scale. One of their favorites is a series of elevated train track pieces that let them build more complex railway layouts than what’s possible with standard Duplo tracks. Thanks to the pre-configured profiles on MakerWorld and the A1 Mini’s automated calibration, most prints succeed on the first try and look fantastic without any additional work required. I simply download a model, send it to the printer, and come back a few hours later to find exactly what I wanted. While the A1 Mini has been a remarkably reliable printer, I did encounter two minor issues that were easily solved with, ironically enough, 3D printing. The first quirk was somewhat messy: the printer would occasionally flick bits of purged filament (affectionately known as “filament poop” in the 3D printing community) onto the floor around the printer. A quick search on MakerWorld revealed dozens of community-designed solutions for this problem. I opted for the “Compact Poop Bucket” design, which catches these bits of waste filament neatly and can be easily emptied when full. The sheer number of different catch solutions available is actually quite amusing – whether you want something purely functional or a design that turns the waste collection into a decorative feature, you’ll find it in the community. The second issue was more annoying and potentially problematic. In its stock configuration, the A1 Mini’s filament guide moves up and down with the Z-axis. During calibration routines or tall prints, this movement sometimes caused the filament to slip off the spool or become tangled – not exactly what you want to discover halfway through a long print. Thankfully, another community-designed solution came to the rescue: a top-mounted Bowden guide that attaches to the top of the Z-axis tower. This keeps the filament path consistent regardless of the print head’s height, completely eliminating the tangling issues. I’ve also printed several quality-of-life improvements, like covers for the printer’s various ports and cable management clips. While none of these upgrades were strictly necessary, they’ve helped keep my setup tidy and protected. It’s somewhat meta that one of the best uses for a 3D printer is printing improvements for itself, but that’s part of what makes this hobby so engaging, especially if you take the time to learn a CAD software tool and gain the ability to create your own 3D models.

Title: Instead of AirPods, I'd recommend Meta Ray-Bans as the best tech deal of Black Friday 2024

'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean? ZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping. We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services we’re assessing. When you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNET nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews. Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers. ZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader. Our goal is to deliver the most accurate information and the most knowledgeable advice possible in order to help you make smarter buying decisions on tech gear and a wide array of products and services. Our editors thoroughly review and fact-check every article to ensure that our content meets the highest standards. If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form. Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we constantly find new chances to save and share them with you on ZDNET.com.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Government on the hook for $115m, Nicola Willis seeks urgent advice

Time Published: 2024-11-28T23:19:18Z

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The Government has $115 million at risk from the collapse of SolarZero. Finance Minister Nicola Willis said she was seeking urgent advice on the SolarZero situation. She had no further comment. NZ Green Investment Finance - a “green investment bank” created by the previous Government to fund environmentally-friendly businesses - made a $145m debt facility available to SolarZero, as well as facilitating $220m in credit lines from international private lenders First Sentier Investors, Natixis Investment Managers and Société Générale. This morning, NZGF said: “A total of $365m from all lenders was available, but this was not fully drawn down at the point of SolarZero’s liquidation - and some had been repaid. “At the time of SolarZero’s liquidation, approximately $115m of NZGIF’s commitment was drawn down against installations.” SolarZero offered no-money-up-front solar panel installations, instead charging a monthly subscription over a 25-year contract. It quoted $177 for a four-person household. United States private equity giant BlackRock bought SolarZero from its Kiwi founders in a mid-2022 deal. The price was not disclosed, but the deal required Overseas Investment Office approval, implying it was above the OIO’s $100m assessment threshold. At the time it went into liquidation, it had 15,000 customers (which it framed as 40% of NZ solar installations) and 160 staff. The debt facilities organised by NZGIF were designed to “allow SolarZero’s residential solar portfolio to increase to 20,000+ owner-occupied homes”. Meanwhile, a SolarZero staffer, who confirmed his identity and role to the Herald, says he asked management for figures on the amount owing to staff. He said 160 staff were told they had been terminated at a 4pm meeting on Tuesday, with no notice period or holiday pay offered. He said he had been told by a member of SolarZero’s executive team that about $1.4m was owing in holiday pay and $1.6m for one-month notice pay. “We have about $300,000 outstanding with our contractors. And then our subcontractors - our field service providers around the country - are owed in total around $600,000. “Some of them are small operators and this could cause them to fold.” He described the sums involved - about $3.7m - as “chump change for a company like BlackRock”. He was planning to join a staff protest outside BlackRock’s Auckland office this afternoon - although he said he had fears for the turnout, given a number of those involved were on work visas. He said they feared being caught on camera by Immigration. The Herald put the staffer’s numbers to one of the liquidators, who did not immediately respond. The liquidators - Stephen Keen and Russell Moore of Grant Thornton - earlier indicated they would not comment until their first report, which is expected within five working days. BlackRock said in a statement to the Herald: “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” NZGIF said in a statement on Tuesday that “NZGIF was informed today that SolarZero’s sole shareholder BlackRock has placed the company into voluntary liquidation”. This morning it added in a statement: “The liquidator’s initial report is due in the next few days. However, it may take some time to understand the final financial implications under a range of scenarios”. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Description: TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Middlefield Limited (the “Manager”), the manager of Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF (TSX:MDIV) and Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF (TSX:MINF) (collectively, the “Funds”), is announcing …

November 28, 2024 17:15 ET | Source: Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlefield Limited (the “Manager”), the manager of Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF (TSX:MDIV) and Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF (TSX:MINF) (collectively, the “Funds”), is announcing its intention to de-emphasize the environmental, sustainability, and governance (“ESG”) factors associated with MINF and MDIV by revising the names, investment objectives and strategies of the Funds. There will be no change to the ticker symbols of the Funds. While the Funds will continue to consider ESG criteria when selecting issuers for their portfolios, they will no longer prioritize these factors over others such as valuation, growth projections, and the quality and track record of the management team. The Manager believes these changes will broaden the investment universe of the Funds, potentially leading to better returns for investors. The Manager notes that similar efforts to de-emphasize ESG factors have been undertaken by many asset management companies, including BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan, and Pimco. Recent research from Morningstar has shown that more funds are removing rather than adding ESG mandates from their investment practices. On March 7, 2024, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced three categories of ESG-Related Funds: ESG Objective Funds, ESG Strategy Funds, and ESG Limited Consideration Funds. Each category has distinct expectations regarding the emphasis on ESG factors in investment decisions. The Manager believes that the proposed changes will result in the Funds moving from the ESG Objective Funds category to the ESG Limited Consideration category.

TORONTO, Nov. 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlefield Limited (the Manager), the manager of Middlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETF (TSX:MDIV) and Middlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETF (TSX:MINF) (collectively, the Funds), is announcing its intention to de-emphasize the environmental, sustainability, and governance (ESG) factors associated with MINF and MDIV by revising the names, investment objectives and strategies of the Funds. There will be no change to the ticker symbols of the Funds. While the Funds will continue to consider ESG criteria when selecting issuers for their portfolios, they will no longer prioritize these factors over others such as valuation, growth projections, and the quality and track record of the management team. The Manager believes these changes will broaden the investment universe of the Funds, potentially leading to better returns for investors. Ticker SymbolCurrent NameRevised NameMDIVMiddlefield Sustainable Global Dividend ETFMiddlefield Global Dividend Growers ETFMINFMiddlefield Sustainable Infrastructure Dividend ETFMiddlefield Global Infrastructure Dividend ETF The Manager notes that similar efforts to de-emphasize ESG factors have been undertaken by many asset management companies, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), State Street (NYSE:STT), JPMorgan, and Pimco. Recent research from Morningstar has shown that more funds are removing rather than adding ESG mandates from their investment practices. On March 7, 2024, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced three categories of ESG-Related Funds: ESG Objective Funds, ESG Strategy Funds, and ESG Limited Consideration Funds. Each category has distinct expectations regarding the emphasis on ESG factors in investment decisions. The Manager believes that the proposed changes will result in the Funds moving from the ESG Objective Funds category to the ESG Limited Consideration category. Special meetings of unitholders of the Funds will be held on or about January 30, 2025, at which unitholders of record as at December 23, 2024 will be asked to approve the revisions. Further details of the meeting, including the proposed changes to the investment objectives and strategies, will be provided in an information circular to be distributed to unitholders of the Funds in advance of the special meeting.

Title: Veterans Harmed by Biden Policies Propose List of Nominees for Incoming Trump Administration

A community of military veterans who fought against initiatives from the Biden administration they deemed unconstitutional have put together a list of 18 names they would like to see appointed to positions in the incoming Trump administration to help President-elect Donald Trump implement reform in the Pentagon or other agencies. Representatives of the community, which consists of 80,000 disaffected veterans whose military careers were ended or damaged after they challenged the Biden administration’s policies, said the list was peer-nominated. “These men and women come from field grade and general officer ranks, have staff experience within the DoD headquarters establishment, and have led exemplary careers within the military, government, and private sector. They have each proven themselves as dedicated public servants, standing fast to their duty to defend the Constitution at great peril to their personal interests,” they said in a statement accompanying the names. “These names do not belong to a special interest group or have vested personal interest, they are merely willing to serve their country again as trusted stewards of the American People,” they added. The names are: “Every American should pay attention to this list, as it represents real leaders who care about the country and constitution over self-interest and institutions,” Air Force veteran and spokeswoman for the group, Kacy Dixon, said. The group putting forward the names first came together as they fought against the Biden Pentagon’s COVID vaccine mandate, which led to the involuntarily discharge of more than 8,000 troops and thousands more who chose to leave. Earlier this year, they drafted the Declaration of Military Accountability, which calls for holding senior military leaders accountable. They have also expanded their call for accountability to the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, government waste, and the DEI agenda. Representative of the group Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Carolyn Rocco said in a statement, “These 18 are the vanguard of over 200 grassroots nominations that are proven courageous public servants ready to restore the military. Each nominee carries unique professional qualifications and has demonstrated their dedication to duty.” Air Force veteran Jordan Karr added, “The rank and file intend to recommend a powerful support team for the future SECDEF; a team that he can count on to restore purpose, unity, and trust to our armed forces.” The group said an additional list of hundreds more names is available upon request.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Uber, the ride-hailing company that has yet to catch onto the AI boom, is reportedly expanding its fleet of gig workers for a new project aimed at AI annotation and data labeling. According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. The report adds that these workers complete projects for internal business units at the ride hailing company but are also serving outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic. The company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the US, Canada, and India, among others. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Over the past few years, even though the firm is yet to launch an eye-catching AI product, it has incorporated AI internally to streamline operations. For example, the AI algorithms of the firm efficiently match riders with drivers to minimize waiting times and maximize driver utilization. These algorithms predict demand, analyze traffic patterns, and estimate trip durations to offer real-time ride assignments. Similarly, the company heavily invests in AI for self-driving car technology. AI systems in these vehicles process data from LiDAR, cameras, and sensors to navigate roads, identify objects, and make decisions in real time.

Per the analyst, Vishay, a semiconductor manufacturing firm, was the hidden winner of the focus. The analyst further added that Vishay had secured better-than-expected orders for NVIDIA's Blackwell AI servers and RTX 50 series graphics cards.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s Been ‘Consistently Bullish on Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI)’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's List of 7 Energy Stocks for the Trump Trade. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) stands against the other energy stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his views on the future of the natural gas and oil sectors under President-elect Donald Trump's administration, alongside a majority Republican Congress. Cramer expressed his belief that companies involved in the natural gas ecosystem will thrive as a result of this new political landscape. He pointed out that the United States is rich in natural gas resources, which can be produced cheaply. While some may believe the country’s position in terms of natural gas production is lower than expected, Cramer noted that, due to the Biden administration’s unfriendly stance toward fossil fuels and a weaker global economy, the natural gas industry had underperformed for much of the year. However, Cramer is optimistic that this trend will soon shift. He emphasized that although the U.S. has vast natural gas reserves, there has been a lack of infrastructure to effectively transport the resource, a problem exacerbated by the Biden administration's resistance to new pipelines. This, according to Cramer, has hindered the industry. He specifically criticized the pause on new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export authorizations, calling it a stunning setback for one of the country’s strongest sectors, which provides thousands of high-paying jobs. He went on to say: “The betting is that Trump's going to undo that on day one, giving new life to all these LNG projects that really have been stuck in limbo.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 13 Stocks in Focus and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight Since the election, natural gas prices have surged more than 70%, although Cramer noted that this increase was partly driven by a cold snap after a warm fall and the delayed start to winter. “Seasonally, this is a good time for the commodity but I also think there’s some optimism about the future of the industry driving this move.” Cramer then shared his broader outlook, saying: “But here's the bottom line: We’re hearing about all sorts of Trump trades right now, and many of these things have made insane moves in less than three weeks, to the point where, actually, they’re feeling precarious to me.” He went on to recommend natural gas as a more sustainable investment, emphasizing that while many sectors have already surged in the wake of the election, natural gas stands out as an industry with long-term potential. Cramer believes that with the incoming administration’s supportive stance toward the fossil fuel sector, the natural gas ecosystem will continue to thrive for years to come. He suggested that investors should look to buy into producers, pipeline companies, and LNG export stocks, all of which he believes have further upside potential now that the regulatory environment has shifted. “I bet they keep running for the next couple of years, not months. They have all moved but they're nowhere versus where they could go now that Biden's anti-fossil fuel team has been broomed for one that is totally supportive of this industry.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during a recent episode of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of an oil and gas pipeline, spanning vast landscapes. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Cramer suggested that pipelines could be a strong investment for those anticipating a natural gas boom under Trump, including Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI), “Other than the producers, what works if you're betting on a natural gas renaissance under Trump… How about a pure play on pipelines? Much easier to build these under a Republican administration. There are plenty of good options here. I've been consistently bullish on Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan, they yield 6.8% and 4.0%, respectively.” Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is an energy infrastructure company, focusing on the transportation, storage, and processing of natural gas, petroleum products, and other commodities, along with CO2 production and related facilities. The company operates one of the largest natural gas transmission networks in the United States, holding an interest in or managing approximately 79,000 miles of pipelines and 139 terminals. It also oversees 702 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas storage capacity and generates about 6.1 Bcf of renewable natural gas annually, with another 0.8 Bcf in development. Additionally, the company transports more than 40% of the country’s natural gas production. The company has a strong project pipeline, with a backlog valued at $5.1 billion. According to Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) management, there are considerable growth opportunities in natural gas, particularly in areas such as LNG exports, cross-border exports to Mexico, power generation, and industrial demand. The company is currently involved in discussions about power opportunities that could exceed 5 Bcf a day, and its internal projections suggest an overall growth of approximately 25 Bcf a day in the natural gas market over the next five years. Overall KMI ranks 3rd on Jim Cramer's list of energy stocks for the Trump trade. While we acknowledge the potential of KMI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KMI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN By Lucy Carter By Matt Martino By Michael Workman ABC NEWS Verify Topic:Retail Industry At first glance, Vogue Melbourne looks every inch an upmarket Australian boutique. The website features photos of models in fashionable clothes and slogans like "Be You Be Beautiful". It boasts 100,000 satisfied customers, an extensive catalogue of items and claims to accept a range of reputable payment options. Look a little closer though and things aren't quite what they seem. You might have noticed that the site is advertising a Halloween sale with up to 50 per cent discounts. Halloween came and went at the end of October, but that sale has continued. Since ABC NEWS Verify started monitoring this site in early October, there has always been an up to 50 per cent discount advertised. Back then, it was called a "winter sale". Let's look closer at one product: this dress. It looks like a professionally taken photograph of a stylish garment. The site even gives it a "trademarked" name "Annaliese". The photos appear to have come from London fashion brand House of CB. The garment is the Lolita Apricot Corset Sundress, for sale with House of CB for $322 (currently on sale for $261). We also found the same photographs advertising the dress on Chinese shopping website AliExpress for as little as $19.09. So either Vogue Melbourne is getting a sweet deal on a designer fashion item, or it is shipping a cheap knock off. As the name — and this sandwich board — suggest, Vogue Melbourne claims to have a physical presence in Victoria's capital. It even lists a physical address on the home page, placing it inside Melbourne's upmarket Emporium shopping centre. But this image has been generated from a custom stock image company. And it's unlikely that a Sydney store will be opening anytime soon when there's no record of the Melbourne store inside the Emporium mall. Then there are the reviews. The site appears to be displaying an authentic Trustpilot review system, a legitimate website which allows customers to provide public feedback about businesses. Vogue Melbourne claims its Trustpilot rating is excellent — but again, it's a fake. The actual rating according to the real Trustpilot site? Bad. But surely it's not all negative, right? At least Vogue Melbourne offers a 30-day, money-back guarantee? Well, the site's real Trustpilot page is full of stories of that promise not being kept by the store. Vogue Melbourne presents itself as a high-end, Australian fashion retailer. But as you can see, it is anything but. ABC NEWS Verify has discovered many more sites just like it, all convincing Australians to part with their money, sometimes for an inferior product and sometimes for no product at all … How social media is giving scammers the tools they need to trick Australians into parting with their money. Vogue Melbourne is one of more than 50 shopping websites ABC NEWS Verify has tracked over several months that appear to be falsely representing themselves online as high-end Australian retailers. Almost exclusively run from overseas, the websites are mass-produced digital stores sometimes selling cheap and often poor-quality products imported directly from Asia. They have a strong and seemingly unchecked presence on Meta's social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. Despite having names like Sydney Stylista, Beaumont Gold Coast and Perth Apparel, Facebook transparency information often shows these pages have several administrators outside of Australia. Nonetheless, social media giant Meta allows these pages to run ads on its platforms that target Australians and funnel them to their websites. Many of the ads use similar language, and sometimes the same images that tug at the heart strings of shoppers, with talk of closing down sales, and shop fires. While there's nothing illegal about shipping goods in from another country, customers are being tricked into thinking they are shopping locally. They're left with little practical recourse for international returns or exchanges, and often hundreds of dollars out of pocket. Meta didn't respond directly to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify by time of publication, but confirmed they are looking into the flagged pages. "We are investigating this matter. Meta doesn't want scams on our platforms, and we are continuing to invest in tools and technology to prevent them. The safety of our users is of utmost importance, and we continue to work with industry, the government and law enforcement to protect Australians from scams." The 57 online stores ABC NEWS Verify has tracked are managed and run by different people and groups but have a very similar look online. The websites appear to have been designed and created using common templates on the e-commerce platform Shopify. They then advertise heavily on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The products they sell are mostly mass-produced fast-fashion items, commonly produced in Asia. The sites all use a legal supply chain model called dropshipping. The product you receive has often been shipped from an entirely different country, without any direct handling from the seller. Normally, when you make a purchase on a website … … it's the retailer who ships the product directly to you. But with dropshipping, the retailer places an order with a supplier, who could be located in a completely different country. That supplier then ships the item directly to you, without the involvement of the retailer who you placed the order with. So what happens when you want to make a return or exchange? Some of these dropshipping websites offer them for "free". But you can't just return your item to the online store that you bought from. Buried in the returns policy fine print of many of the stores we investigated, was a clause which states returns are shipped back to a central warehouse in Asia. That's the original supplier. And while the buyer could possibly get their money back … … what they're often surprised to learn, often buried in the fine print, is that they have to foot the international shipping bill to send the item back to the supplier. This can sometimes be close to or equal the amount paid for the item in the first place. This is difficult for consumer regulators to police, as while dropshipping is a perfectly legal business model, where this scam begins is the misleading tactics being used to deceive shoppers into thinking they've been dealing with a local business. This can leave customers feeling misled, dissatisfied and out-of-pocket. Rosie Thomas, the director of campaigns at consumer watchdog Choice told ABC NEWS Verify that after thinking you've been dealing with an Australian business, the idea that you would have to pay to ship the item back overseas to return it often comes as "quite a shock". "Even if you return the item, if you don't get the refund, or you don't get the response that you would like, there are limited options in the digital environment as to where you can take your complaint." Catriona Lowe, the deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission told ABC NEWS Verify that all customers shopping online in Australia — even with international operators — have rights. "All businesses that trade in Australia are required to comply with the Australian consumer law, and that includes not misleading consumers about where your business is based." "If consumers do feel that they've been misled by this conduct, we encourage them to get in contact either with our info centre or with their state and territory fair trading agencies." Retired music teacher Julie (not her real name) was excited when she spotted a colourful knitted jumper advertised for sale on Instagram by the now-defunct online store Aussie Hilda. At $84 the jumper wasn't an insignificant purchase for the aged pensioner, but she reasoned that its 'original price', at $250, was listed far higher and that she may have stumbled onto a bargain. "Very naively, my mind thought that it was a good quality item and it had been reduced. I thought it was coming from Australia. And I thought if there's any problem with it, I'll be able to just send it back to Australia, probably to Melbourne," she said. What arrived in the post several weeks later was far from the high-quality warm jumper she was expecting. Instead it was a low-quality polyester fabric with the pattern of a knit printed onto it. "I was just absolutely shocked to the socks about it, because it was just such a complete piece of garbage. "Thin plastic-y fabric has been used to make the jumper and then something is stamped onto it at the front and the back." The ACCC's Catriona Lowe says it appears Julie has the right to lodge a formal complaint. "It is incredibly important that the business is not misleading consumers about the nature of their business, about what they might expect in terms of delivery times and of course, that what they are purchasing, or what they can see online, matches what they ultimately are delivered." A second shock came when Julie tried to return the item and arrange a refund. "They said I'd have to send it back to some address in China somewhere, and that I would have to pay the postage to which I said to them, 'well, it's going to cost me almost the same amount in postage as it cost me for the actual item'," Julie said. Julie is one of more than 40 disgruntled customers of these websites that ABC NEWS Verify has spoken to as part of this investigation. She eventually managed to obtain a refund through PayPal after weeks of frustrating back and forth with Aussie Hilda administrators, who appear to be located in Indonesia. Extraordinarily, when the 73-year-old Sydneysider reported the page to Instagram's parent company Meta for its deceptive behaviour, she says her account was temporarily blocked, while Aussie Hilda's page remained active and advertising for many more weeks. "I would never buy anything through Instagram or Facebook again," she said. Choice's Ms Thomas says Meta needs to do much more. "We think, at a minimum, Meta should be verifying the identities of the businesses that it's taking money from to advertise on their platforms. "This would ensure that those businesses are who they say they are. And in the case of scams, should pick up whether or not it is an impersonation and and there's a significant risk for consumers." One of the most common deceptions we've seen the 57 tracked websites use is fake product reviews. In addition to the fake Trustpilot reviews highlighted earlier, many of these sites also display fake unbranded testimonials often using stock or AI generated images. The familiar names on these reviews below, for example, give away the game. The names do not even match the supplied photographs. These fake reviews often have wording that no human would ever actually use. Using dated Australian slang like "cobber" and describing delivery as "quick as a rat up a drainpipe", they appear to be crafted to seem authentic to Australians but are anything but. The lies and AI carry over to many of the ads we see plastered across Meta's social media platforms — with claims of shops closing down, burning down and using artificially generated store owners. We've also tracked shops stealing or altering photos of real Australian shopfronts. Legitimate Melbourne store Kloke had no idea a photo of its very real store was being used by Wilson Melbourne on its Facebook page, until contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. Fake Sydney outlet TrendyOz is actually a badly photoshopped photo of a Calvin Klein store in Sydney's CBD Westfield. Online store Vogue Melbourne claims to be run by Garry Williams, an Australian physiotherapist and Cècile Laurent, a "talented" French fashion designer. Vogue Melbourne presents these photographs of "Garry" and "Cècile" on its About Us page. As we mentioned, it claims Garry is Australian, and Cècile is French. But Vogue Melbourne is not the only shopping website these images appear on. They're also here on Marlo London, which targets British customers. But this time, Garry is English. At Modezentrum Krause, which looks identical but targets German customers, the language changes … Cècile and her profession remain. Garry, meanwhile, has been replaced by "Thomas Krause", who is now a German physiotherapist. ABC NEWS Verify has established the real identities of both of these people using open source intelligence techniques. Both had their images taken from their own websites or social media accounts, apparently without their knowledge. "Garry" is actually a Dutch man, who we were not able to contact. And "Cècile" is an American woman named Cora, who expressed astonishment that her image had been stolen and used on these websites when contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. "I had no idea they were using my photo or claiming it was them in the photo. There was definitely no consent given on my part," she said. "It is extremely confusing why they would take my photo and say that they are the ones in it. They are trying to deceive people and it's quite sickening. It's also just frustrating because that is a photo of me working and taken by a professional photographer which makes me feel violated." These three websites appear to be connected to each other through a single operator, as well as to a fourth website, Averley Boutique Toronto. The websites list the same Dutch business name and number in their terms and service pages and ABC NEWS Verify has also documented them using the same PayPal as a payment beneficiary. The beneficiary is listed as NYH E-Commerce. According to Dutch business records, the company has a sole shareholder and employee named Nadir El Haddouti. The postal address for the business is this self-storage unit in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It isn't clear where Mr El Haddouti lives, but he has ties to both the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates through his Dutch-registered business. His business number is also listed on the website of a luxury car rental company based in Dubai as well as a consultancy business geared towards minimising value-added tax for dropshippers, based in the Netherlands. Dutch business records show the operations related to his business number include the "renting of passenger cars and light motor vehicles" and "retail sale via internet of apparel and clothing accessories". Social media accounts belonging to the luxury car rental business, Carplug Dubai, suggest the operator mixes with others living opulent lifestyles. For instance, one video, which shows a young man revving a performance car valued at over $100,000, is captioned in Dutch "Samen met de jongste CEO van NL". This translates to "Together with the youngest CEO of NL [the Netherlands]". ABC NEWS Verify attempted to contact Mr El Haddouti through various channels, but received no response. Opaque ownership is common to the 57 pages tracked by ABC NEWS Verify. We detected ties to individuals based overseas in all the sites we tracked. Links to the Netherlands were frequently found among this cohort. Operating a business outside of Australia that dropships goods into the country is something that is perfectly legal and thus, outside the scope of regulators. Where it becomes a problem is when consumers think they are dealing with a local business, and all the imputations of quality and ease of dealings that come with that assumption. There's a whole industry built around creating websites just like these on gig economy websites like Fiverr. ABC NEWS Verify has seen a range of different prices and delivery times for fully operational shopping websites offered on that platform. The cheapest and quickest we came across was a 10-product website with a three-day delivery time for just under $50. We saw prices on other accounts for as much as $1,000 for a 50-product store delivered in a week. Some of these sellers go on to offer to manage the marketing and operation of the page for several hundred of dollars a month. ABC NEWS Verify also came across multiple websites that were almost identical in layout. We know the websites were being operated by different people because the PayPal beneficiaries were different, and their Facebook pages listed administrators in different countries. These four seemingly unrelated pages all appear to be modelled from a website called Sol and Sparrow Melbourne. Whoever built the three copies hasn't even bothered to delete Sol and Sparrow's name from the body copy on some of their product pages and some use the very same images. Shopify didn't respond to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify but a spokesperson confirmed it was investigating the online shops flagged. "Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) clearly outlines what is not permitted on our platform. We're reviewing these stores and will take action on any found to violate our policies." There are now a range of companies online that allow these websites to be created with ease and at scale, meaning purveyors can dropship to anywhere in the world with little effort. It's clear these Australian-targeted websites we have uncovered are just the tip of an international iceberg. Remember that dress from before? A simple reverse image search shows a raft of similar internationally-focused websites on which it appears. This grift is truly global. As shoppers wade through Black Friday sales and then into Christmas shopping, many might be asking how they can keep themselves safe when seeking to buy high quality and good value products online. ABC NEWS Verify asked our experts from Choice and the ACCC for their top tips when it comes to shopping online and avoiding scams. Ms Thomas from Choice says slowing down is key. "Scam ads or fraudulent retailer ads very likely will create a sense of urgency to try and make you act quickly. "Take a moment to check the website, check the URL, see if there are any red flags that suggest that maybe this business is not what you think it is." (It's worth mentioning that none of the URLs we encountered in our investigation carried a .au Australian domain, though its presence in a URL doesn't necessarily mean the site you're looking at is not a scam.) Catriona Lowe from the ACCC agrees that doing a bit of homework can save heartache later on. Being skeptical of reviews posted directly on the website is a good start. "Be wary of websites that you're not familiar with, including if you might have received adverts about them on social media," she said. A really good thing to do is to check online forums and review sites, because often you might, you might find that other consumers will be talking. "And then the last tip that we give to people is, if you are feeling a little cautious you may wish to shop with a credit or debit card. What that means is, if something does go wrong, you may have the right to do what's called a chargeback, and that means actually reversing that transaction with your financial institution, rather than the particular business that you might have given those details to." ABC NEWS Verify spent months documenting and investigating overseas dropshipping operations that falsely claimed to have a physical presence in Australia. The operations were identified by reviewing advertisements targeting Australians on Meta's platforms like Facebook along with keyword searches of Meta's ad library. Our investigation focused on stores that had an implied and or explicit physical presence in Australia — ranging from stores using Australian locations in their names to dropshipping stores creating digital images of fake physical shop fronts in Australian locations. ABC NEWS Verify then investigated who was behind them, unearthing links across the globe including ties to countries such as the Netherlands, UAE, China and the United States. Our investigation also helped unveil some of the common tactics and practices these kinds of operations deploy. Although ABC NEWS Verify uncovered the identity of several overseas individuals and businesses linked to some stores, most remain opaque, due in part to measures by the operators to mask their ownership and because of the transparency limitations of the Australian version of Meta's ad library. Although Meta has greater transparency on digital ads than some other digital platforms, the company's ad transparency in Australia is limited compared to some jurisdictions like the EU. Meta in the EU is subject to the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) which, once introduced, compelled Meta to display and archive all ads that targeted people in the EU, and store them for a year. Detecting scammers and others abusing Meta's platforms in Australia remains a "whack-a-mole" exercise — one exacerbated by Meta's closure of the transparency tool CrowdTangle earlier this year.

At $84 the jumper wasn't an insignificant purchase for the aged pensioner, but she reasoned that its 'original price', at $250, was listed far higher and that she may have stumbled onto a bargain. "Very naively, my mind thought that it was a good quality item and it had been reduced. I thought it was coming from Australia. And I thought if there's any problem with it, I'll be able to just send it back to Australia, probably to Melbourne," she said. What arrived in the post several weeks later was far from the high-quality warm jumper she was expecting. Instead it was a low-quality polyester fabric with the pattern of a knit printed onto it. "I was just absolutely shocked to the socks about it, because it was just such a complete piece of garbage. "Thin plastic-y fabric has been used to make the jumper and then something is stamped onto it at the front and the back." The ACCC's Catriona Lowe says it appears Julie has the right to lodge a formal complaint. "It is incredibly important that the business is not misleading consumers about the nature of their business, about what they might expect in terms of delivery times and of course, that what they are purchasing, or what they can see online, matches what they ultimately are delivered." A second shock came when Julie tried to return the item and arrange a refund. "They said I'd have to send it back to some address in China somewhere, and that I would have to pay the postage to which I said to them, 'well, it's going to cost me almost the same amount in postage as it cost me for the actual item'," Julie said. Julie is one of more than 40 disgruntled customers of these websites that ABC NEWS Verify has spoken to as part of this investigation. She eventually managed to obtain a refund through PayPal after weeks of frustrating back and forth with Aussie Hilda administrators, who appear to be located in Indonesia. Extraordinarily, when the 73-year-old Sydneysider reported the page to Instagram's parent company Meta for its deceptive behaviour, she says her account was temporarily blocked, while Aussie Hilda's page remained active and advertising for many more weeks. "I would never buy anything through Instagram or Facebook again," she said. Choice's Ms Thomas says Meta needs to do much more. "We think, at a minimum, Meta should be verifying the identities of the businesses that it's taking money from to advertise on their platforms. "This would ensure that those businesses are who they say they are. And in the case of scams, should pick up whether or not it is an impersonation and and there's a significant risk for consumers." One of the most common deceptions we've seen the 57 tracked websites use is fake product reviews. In addition to the fake Trustpilot reviews highlighted earlier, many of these sites also display fake unbranded testimonials often using stock or AI generated images. The familiar names on these reviews below, for example, give away the game. The names do not even match the supplied photographs. These fake reviews often have wording that no human would ever actually use. Using dated Australian slang like "cobber" and describing delivery as "quick as a rat up a drainpipe", they appear to be crafted to seem authentic to Australians but are anything but. The lies and AI carry over to many of the ads we see plastered across Meta's social media platforms — with claims of shops closing down, burning down and using artificially generated store owners. We've also tracked shops stealing or altering photos of real Australian shopfronts. Legitimate Melbourne store Kloke had no idea a photo of its very real store was being used by Wilson Melbourne on its Facebook page, until contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. Fake Sydney outlet TrendyOz is actually a badly photoshopped photo of a Calvin Klein store in Sydney's CBD Westfield. Online store Vogue Melbourne claims to be run by Garry Williams, an Australian physiotherapist and Cècile Laurent, a "talented" French fashion designer. Vogue Melbourne presents these photographs of "Garry" and "Cècile" on its About Us page. As we mentioned, it claims Garry is Australian, and Cècile is French. But Vogue Melbourne is not the only shopping website these images appear on. They're also here on Marlo London, which targets British customers. But this time, Garry is English. At Modezentrum Krause, which looks identical but targets German customers, the language changes … Cècile and her profession remain. Garry, meanwhile, has been replaced by "Thomas Krause", who is now a German physiotherapist. ABC NEWS Verify has established the real identities of both of these people using open source intelligence techniques. Both had their images taken from their own websites or social media accounts, apparently without their knowledge. "Garry" is actually a Dutch man, who we were not able to contact. And "Cècile" is an American woman named Cora, who expressed astonishment that her image had been stolen and used on these websites when contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. "I had no idea they were using my photo or claiming it was them in the photo. There was definitely no consent given on my part," she said. "It is extremely confusing why they would take my photo and say that they are the ones in it. They are trying to deceive people and it's quite sickening. It's also just frustrating because that is a photo of me working and taken by a professional photographer which makes me feel violated." These three websites appear to be connected to each other through a single operator, as well as to a fourth website, Averley Boutique Toronto. The websites list the same Dutch business name and number in their terms and service pages and ABC NEWS Verify has also documented them using the same PayPal as a payment beneficiary. The beneficiary is listed as NYH E-Commerce. According to Dutch business records, the company has a sole shareholder and employee named Nadir El Haddouti. The postal address for the business is this self-storage unit in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It isn't clear where Mr El Haddouti lives, but he has ties to both the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates through his Dutch-registered business. His business number is also listed on the website of a luxury car rental company based in Dubai as well as a consultancy business geared towards minimising value-added tax for dropshippers, based in the Netherlands. Dutch business records show the operations related to his business number include the "renting of passenger cars and light motor vehicles" and "retail sale via internet of apparel and clothing accessories". Social media accounts belonging to the luxury car rental business, Carplug Dubai, suggest the operator mixes with others living opulent lifestyles. For instance, one video, which shows a young man revving a performance car valued at over $100,000, is captioned in Dutch "Samen met de jongste CEO van NL". This translates to "Together with the youngest CEO of NL [the Netherlands]". ABC NEWS Verify attempted to contact Mr El Haddouti through various channels, but received no response. Opaque ownership is common to the 57 pages tracked by ABC NEWS Verify. We detected ties to individuals based overseas in all the sites we tracked. Links to the Netherlands were frequently found among this cohort. Operating a business outside of Australia that dropships goods into the country is something that is perfectly legal and thus, outside the scope of regulators. Where it becomes a problem is when consumers think they are dealing with a local business, and all the imputations of quality and ease of dealings that come with that assumption. There's a whole industry built around creating websites just like these on gig economy websites like Fiverr. ABC NEWS Verify has seen a range of different prices and delivery times for fully operational shopping websites offered on that platform. The cheapest and quickest we came across was a 10-product website with a three-day delivery time for just under $50. We saw prices on other accounts for as much as $1,000 for a 50-product store delivered in a week. Some of these sellers go on to offer to manage the marketing and operation of the page for several hundred of dollars a month. ABC NEWS Verify also came across multiple websites that were almost identical in layout. We know the websites were being operated by different people because the PayPal beneficiaries were different, and their Facebook pages listed administrators in different countries. These four seemingly unrelated pages all appear to be modelled from a website called Sol and Sparrow Melbourne. Whoever built the three copies hasn't even bothered to delete Sol and Sparrow's name from the body copy on some of their product pages and some use the very same images. Shopify didn't respond to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify but a spokesperson confirmed it was investigating the online shops flagged. "Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) clearly outlines what is not permitted on our platform. We're reviewing these stores and will take action on any found to violate our policies." There are now a range of companies online that allow these websites to be created with ease and at scale, meaning purveyors can dropship to anywhere in the world with little effort. It's clear these Australian-targeted websites we have uncovered are just the tip of an international iceberg. Remember that dress from before? A simple reverse image search shows a raft of similar internationally-focused websites on which it appears. This grift is truly global. As shoppers wade through Black Friday sales and then into Christmas shopping, many might be asking how they can keep themselves safe when seeking to buy high quality and good value products online. ABC NEWS Verify asked our experts from Choice and the ACCC for their top tips when it comes to shopping online and avoiding scams. Ms Thomas from Choice says slowing down is key. "Scam ads or fraudulent retailer ads very likely will create a sense of urgency to try and make you act quickly. "Take a moment to check the website, check the URL, see if there are any red flags that suggest that maybe this business is not what you think it is." (It's worth mentioning that none of the URLs we encountered in our investigation carried a .au Australian domain, though its presence in a URL doesn't necessarily mean the site you're looking at is not a scam.) Catriona Lowe from the ACCC agrees that doing a bit of homework can save heartache later on. Being skeptical of reviews posted directly on the website is a good start. "Be wary of websites that you're not familiar with, including if you might have received adverts about them on social media," she said. A really good thing to do is to check online forums and review sites, because often you might, you might find that other consumers will be talking. "And then the last tip that we give to people is, if you are feeling a little cautious you may wish to shop with a credit or debit card. What that means is, if something does go wrong, you may have the right to do what's called a chargeback, and that means actually reversing that transaction with your financial institution, rather than the particular business that you might have given those details to." ABC NEWS Verify spent months documenting and investigating overseas dropshipping operations that falsely claimed to have a physical presence in Australia. The operations were identified by reviewing advertisements targeting Australians on Meta's platforms like Facebook along with keyword searches of Meta's ad library. Our investigation focused on stores that had an implied and or explicit physical presence in Australia — ranging from stores using Australian locations in their names to dropshipping stores creating digital images of fake physical shop fronts in Australian locations. ABC NEWS Verify then investigated who was behind them, unearthing links across the globe including ties to countries such as the Netherlands, UAE, China and the United States. Our investigation also helped unveil some of the common tactics and practices these kinds of operations deploy. Although ABC NEWS Verify uncovered the identity of several overseas individuals and businesses linked to some stores, most remain opaque, due in part to measures by the operators to mask their ownership and because of the transparency limitations of the Australian version of Meta's ad library. Although Meta has greater transparency on digital ads than some other digital platforms, the company's ad transparency in Australia is limited compared to some jurisdictions like the EU. Meta in the EU is subject to the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) which, once introduced, compelled Meta to display and archive all ads that targeted people in the EU, and store them for a year. Detecting scammers and others abusing Meta's platforms in Australia remains a "whack-a-mole" exercise — one exacerbated by Meta's closure of the transparency tool CrowdTangle earlier this year.

Title: I've been looking for an LG OLED C4 deal all year, and Black Friday has finally delivered

The 55-inch LG OLED C4 is finally at the price I've been hoping for When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I have been hoping, saving, and waiting for a Black Friday OLED TV deal this year. I got a 4K TV in August of 2020, and although it's served me very well, it's starting to get backlight bleed - an annoying degradation of the display where its backlight rings shine through the panel and become easy to spot. As someone who reviews all sorts of technology for a living, I know that OLED TVs are the ones worth spending money on these days, but they're not the easiest to afford. This year I've been scraping money together where I can, and I've been watching the price of LG's 55-inch OLED C4 like a hawk because I know that it's the perfect TV for me, but this brand's screens only enter my price range once or twice a year. I've been waiting for it to drop as close to the $1,000 mark as possible - mainly because I still want to be able to pay my rent. Black Friday has finally delivered the goods, because it's now down to $1,196.99 at Amazon, giving it a $300 discount. Besides a blip on the price history data that sort of looks like someone pressed the wrong button somewhere, this is the cheapest this screen has ever fallen to. A brief Black Friday OLED TV deal brought it down to $1,096 about two weeks ago before it was immediately hoisted back upward. The 55-inch models of LG's OLEDs can be tough to find deals for because they're one of the most popular sizes in the range, and stock can disappear in a heartbeat. LG OLED C4 55-inch TV | $1,499.99 $1,196.99 at AmazonSave $300 - This is likely as close to the $1,000 mark you'll find this display drop to before it starts being replaced by the inevitable C5. Sometimes you see this model get discounts in February as LG tries to get rid of stock, but it can be really tough to find good deals on these TVs from this point on. Buy it if: ✅ You want one of the best pound-for-pound gaming TVs on the market✅ You want a screen with a high refresh rate✅ You've been waiting for a good deal Don't buy it if: ❌ You can make do with a slower refresh rate❌ You need to keep saving for now Price check: $1,296 at Walmart | $1,199.99 at Best Buy UK: £1,199 at Currys So why is it the LG OLED C4 that I'm so desperate to go for? Other brands do make OLED displays these days, and some of them can be a bit cheaper than LG. Well, for starters, I know that LG is the company that makes the OLED technology for a lot of smaller TV brands, so you know you're getting the purest form of panel straight from the source if you buy from them. Next, it's the 55-inch size I'm looking for because that suits my home the most. A 65-inch 4K display might actually look like better quality due to viewing distances and pixel densities, but I think that size of screen would be a bit intense for the room I'd put it in. I think 55-inch is the best value spot for a living room screen size worth investing in, without overspending on the sizes TV manufacturers tell you you need. Then there are specs, which might help you to decide which of the best gaming TVs is the best for you. I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, and my time for viewing them is sacred. I want to make it as close to a cinema atmosphere as possible, and an OLED panel combined with Dolby Vision support will really bring that feeling home. Next, I want to use it for PC gaming, so I'd like a high refresh rate. The C4 sports a stunning 144Hz refresh rate that my Maingear Zero Ruby will absolutely be able to make use of. I wouldn't wait around if any of this sounds relatable to you. LG OLEDs are popular choices, and I'd expect the 55-inch model to fly off the shelves this Black Friday. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more There are other offers to make the most of if this is out of your price range. Black Friday Meta Quest deals, Black Friday Xbox deals, and Black Friday CPU deals might get you a bigger saving that's more achievable for you. One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote One of the best value gaming monitors I've tested is now cheaper than ever Let me show you how to grab a 100-inch QLED TV this Black Friday and upset everyone you live with The LG OLED B4 is now under $600 for Cyber Monday, and it's my favorite TV deal of the year GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: Consumer Debt, Trump, and Precious Metals: Insights from Greg Weldon
URL: https://activistpost.com/2024/11/consumer-debt-trump-and-precious-metals-insights-from-greg-weldon.html
Time Published: 2024-11-28T17:15:37Z
Full Content:
November 28, 2024 By Money Metals Exchange Mike Maharrey, reporter and analyst at Money Metals Exchange, interviewed Greg Weldon, CEO of Weldon Financial and editor of newsletters such as Weldon’s Money Monitor and Metal Monitor. Weldon, often referred to as “The Gold Guru,” shared his macroeconomic insights on inflation, consumer debt, and precious metals, offering valuable guidance for investors navigating today’s economic complexities. ﻿ Greg Weldon highlighted how the current economic environment contrasts sharply with the 1980s. He explained that today’s high levels of debt fundamentally alter the U.S. economy’s ability to grow sustainably. He pointed out that the Federal Reserve’s decision to tolerate higher inflation, as outlined in Jerome Powell’s 2018 Jackson Hole speech, reflects the challenges of managing the debt burden. Weldon emphasized that the economic optimism following Trump’s election may falter as the reality of debt-driven constraints becomes clearer. Price & Buy Weldon raised alarms about consumer credit conditions, suggesting the U.S. may be approaching a financial tipping point. He pointed to declining savings and rising delinquencies as signs of severe strain on American households. These trends, Weldon noted, indicate that consumers are nearing their borrowing capacity, potentially triggering broader economic challenges. Weldon remains optimistic about the long-term potential of gold and silver. He sees central bank demand and limited speculative interest as key drivers for future growth in the metals market. Gold: Silver: Weldon emphasized that corrections in precious metals markets often provide buying opportunities for long-term investors. Price & Buy Weldon detailed several global risks shaping the economic landscape. Severe drought conditions in the U.S., geopolitical tensions, and inflationary pressures are creating a challenging environment for policymakers and investors alike. These dynamics, Weldon explained, will likely exacerbate inflation and push the Federal Reserve toward more aggressive interventions. Weldon offered a nuanced perspective on cryptocurrencies, recognizing their utility in combating currency devaluation while noting their speculative nature. He sees Bitcoin as distinct from gold, often behaving more like a risk asset tied to stock market movements. Weldon advised investors to balance crypto holdings with physical assets like gold and silver to mitigate risks. Price & Buy To navigate the current economic landscape, Weldon stressed the importance of blending macro and microeconomic analysis. He highlighted opportunities in mining shares and suggested using technical analysis to identify key entry points. Weldon encouraged investors to diversify across sectors and asset classes to hedge against economic uncertainties. Greg Weldon concluded by emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive investment strategy that combines macroeconomic insights, technical analysis, and sector-specific knowledge. For those interested in his research, Weldon offers detailed reports and managed account services. He can be reached at [email protected], and his podcast, Money Markets, and New Age Investing, is available on major platforms. During the Money Metals Podcast, Greg Weldon addressed a wide range of pressing economic topics, offering insights into inflation, consumer credit challenges, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies. Below are some of the key questions posed by host Mike Maharrey and Weldon’s in-depth answers, providing valuable perspectives for investors navigating today’s complex markets. The debt levels today are significantly higher, which fundamentally alters the economy’s ability to grow. Unlike the 1980s under Ronald Reagan, the U.S. no longer has the flexibility to manage inflation through high interest rates due to the massive debt burden. Greg Weldon projects gold prices to reach $4,900 within three years, driven by strong central bank demand and limited speculative interest. Corrections in gold prices offer buying opportunities. China’s increased demand for silver and its dual role as an industrial and monetary metal are critical. Silver’s technical breakout at $31.60 could signal a strong upward trend. Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset tied to stock market movements than as “digital gold.” While useful for protecting against currency devaluation in some countries, cryptocurrencies face risks like infrastructure disruptions. Diversification with physical assets like gold is advised. Weldon highlighted Canadian miners like Torex and Wheaton as strong candidates due to favorable technical setups and currency dynamics. Uranium stocks are also gaining momentum. Severe drought conditions in the U.S., rising food prices, geopolitical tensions, and inflation pose significant challenges. These factors could force the Federal Reserve to act more aggressively, affecting market dynamics. Weldon provides detailed reports like the Global Macro Strategy Report and The Gold Guru, along with managed account services.

Title: Black Friday Week deals: Surface 7 Snapdragon X Elite $400 off, Meta Quest 3, supersized smart display, more
URL: http://9to5google.com/2024/11/28/black-friday-surface-7-snapdragon-x-elite-meta-quest-3/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T16:57:16Z
Full Content:
We already touched down this morning with our master roundup of the best Thanksgiving price drops, but there’s even more to come and some particular highlights we wanted to showcase. We have now have a new all-time low Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 7 with 12-core Snapdragon X Elite chip at over $400 off alongside a giant selection of other Snapdragon and Chromebook deals. Those offers join Google’s Black Friday price drop on Pixel 9 Pro XL that is now $100 less than advertised, a rare deal on Meta Quest 3 for Black Friday, the very first discount on the new supersized Echo Show 21 smart display, and the best price ever on the 2024 Samsung S24 FE from $450 shipped. But all that’s all just for starters, head below for a closer look at today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is now offering Microsoft’s 2024 Surface Laptop 7 Copilot+ PC at $999 shipped. That’s $401 less than its usual going rate of $1,400 and the lowest we have tracked for it so far. Today’s 29% offer drops this touchscreen Copilot+ PC with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD $100 below its previous all-time low, and it’s now only $100 more than its relatively less powerful sibling with the Snapdragon X Plus chip. The new Surface Laptop 7 is available in Platinum, Black, Dune, and Sapphire colorways, and they’re all down to the $999 low today. The same model, in case you’re wondering, is currently fetching $1,100 at Best Buy. Head below for more details. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: While the official Google Black Friday sale got off to an early start this year only to see Amazon and Best Buy get aggressive with even deeper deals, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has now dropped again. Google advertised and subsequently launched a $150 price drop on this model and now Amazon has it starting down at $849 shipped – Best Buy has since priced matched on this model as well. Regularly $1,099, this is a straight $250 price drop to deliver a new Amazon all-time low and the lowest we have tracked to date on Google’s latest XL-sized handset. Best Buy is currently offering a $75 gift card with Meta’s 512GB Quest 3 VR headset at $499.99 shipped as a part of its Black Friday Doorbuster deals. This particular headset dropped to the $499 mark after the Quest 3S debut in September. Today’s Black Friday deal essentially lands a $75 discount on it with a FREE gift card that can go towards your other purchases at Best Buy. Head below for more details. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. Update 11/28: Amazon has now price matched the Best Buy Doorbuster offer starting $449.99 shipped. Update 11/28: Best Buy’s next Doorbuster sale is now offering the new Samsung S24 FE from $449.99 shipped to deliver the lowest price we have tracked to date at $200 off the going rate – this deal is currently undercutting both Samsung and Amazon. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details. Here’s how the discounted pricing works out right now across the lineup before you factor in the Samsung credit bonus or the trade-in options: Subscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!

Christmas Billy Binion, Fiona Harrigan, Jeff Luse, Kelvey Vander Hart, J.D. Tuccille, Adam Sullivan, Ian Keyser, Justin Zuckerman, Christian Britschgi, Adani Samat, Bekah Congdon, Zach Weissmueller, Jack Nicastro, Regan Taylor, Cody Huff, Eric Boehm, Katherine Mangu-Ward, Natalie Dowzicky, Danielle Thompson, Matthew Petti, Jason Russell, Emma Camp, Veronique de Rugy, Ronald Bailey, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Peter Suderman, Brian Doherty, César Báez, Hunt Beaty, Jacob Sullum, Bess Byers, and John Carter | 11.28.2024 10:32 AM Time is no longer real. (Was it ever?) Christmas decor is back—which seems to happen in some stores before Halloween, naturally—and you may be bracing your ears to hear "Last Christmas" by Wham! on repeat, as the universe apparently decided long ago that that should be the eternal holiday soundtrack. (It's a bop, if you ask me.) In any case, those festive changes also signal something else: It's time to go shopping for some presents. First off, for those in your life who enjoy ideas, politics, libertarianism, and/or reading actual physical pages—vintage!—you can give the gift of Reason. We offer three years of our magazine (that's 33 issues) for $37.97—a mere $1.15 a pop. Shoppers can also select two years (22 issues) for $25.97, and one year (11 issues) for $14.97. Who wouldn't want to develop a monthly ritual of reading a package of pieces that challenge conventional wisdom, like our December issue about how we should abolish everything? There's probably someone—many people?—in your life who'd look at you like you have 17 heads if you were to make that argument. Which is why you should give them Reason. We also have our trusty swag store with apparel for men, women, and even babies, as well as a very sturdy camper mug. My personal favorite is our Reason windbreaker (which, unfortunately, does not come in baby size yet). No need to be cold while you're repping or evangelizing. For a more diverse set of suggestions—from art to vice to games and maybe a little magic—Reason did as we always do: We polled our staff to help ease your shopping woes. Merry merry. —Billy Binion, reporter Politicians have been waging war against airline "junk fees": the extra charges travelers face for seat reservations, itinerary changes, or checked bags. You can help your loved ones do a little bit of that themselves—arguably more effectively—by buying them a set of packing cubes this holiday season. Stay with me here. Packing cubes are zippered pouches that come in a variety of sizes and nest into a suitcase. Each holds a different type of item, which helps travelers avoid overpacking and keeps garments organized. They're a surprisingly effective way to cram a full vacation's worth of clothing into a compact suitcase, making them a great purchase for anyone who would rather not deal with the hassle (and cost) of checking a bag. That means fewer fees and less stress, particularly for those friends who insist on flying Spirit Airlines. Traveling has never been easier thanks to innovations such as translation apps, rideshare services, downloadable offline maps, and, yes, packing cubes, which make getting to your destination a smoother and more affordable experience—no bureaucrats required. —Fiona Harrigan, deputy managing editor Buy Veken packing cubes for $16.98 Every year, millions of Americans flee suburbia and city life to visit beaches for summer vacation. I suspect many Reason subscribers visit my home—the Outer Banks in North Carolina—which sees its population spike from less than 40,000 in the winter to almost 300,000 per week in the summer. While libertarians may disagree on many things, we agree on at least one core fundamental: We love freedom. To me, there's no place freer than the beach, where people can forget about life's challenges and truly unwind. But since the summer months are, unfortunately, still a ways away, Christmas is the perfect time to give the thalassophile in your life a taste—or smell, rather—of what's to come. Gift a Sex Wax air freshener. This product—for a car, house, or office—will take you back to sandy beaches, slow-rolling waves, and piña coladas at sunset. Available in packs of three, they're a particularly apt stocking stuffer (especially the coconut scent, which is my favorite). And if you're in the market for a more wrappable gift, consider ordering some candles from local beach artisans. Your loved ones will cruise through winter surrounded by beachy fragrances, and you'll be supporting a local economy in the off-season. —Jeff Luse, deputy managing editor Buy Sex Wax air freshener for $9.98 Shop the Outer Banks Candle Company America's national parks are spectacular. They highlight the best of our country's landscapes, with views that look almost too beautiful to be real. The outdoorsy loved one in your life is almost certainly, or should be, a fan—even if they think the government should get out of the parks business. But despite the wealth of taxpayer funding the parks receive, visiting a federally-managed outdoor site is still pricey. "Didn't my taxes already pay for this?" your token libertarian friends or family members may find themselves asking at the gate, consumed by sticker shock. "User fees are the superior funding structure, yes. But both?" The solution: Get them an America the Beautiful National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass. Technically, you'll still be handing the federal government money. But you can rest assured that the price for one of these annual passes is far lower than just a couple of gate fees in a given year. With the annual pass, your loved one can visit over 2,000 sites—including the iconic Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Acadia national parks, oh my!—without paying entrance fees. Better yet, they can bring friends in the same vehicle, and the pass usually covers those entrance fees, too. Take that, government! —Kelvey Vander Hart, communications specialist Buy an America the Beautiful National Parks Pass for $80 I was recently replacing a dry-rotted trim board on the exterior of my house. As I held the new board in place, screws ready to go into the pilot holes, I realized I'd neglected to bring a screwdriver up the ladder with me. Fortunately, I had a multitool on my belt and it was good enough for the job. That's the way it usually goes with multitools: They're almost never the best tool for the job. But when they're the only tool in reach, or you want to tote something just in case, they're good enough. For years I've carried a Leatherman Rebar and a Micra. But last year I gave my son a Wave+ as an off-to-college present. While a full toolbox would have been a bit much for his dorm room, his Wave+ has proven itself to be up to shelf assembly and the tasks that university maintenance occasionally neglects. It would probably work for you, too, when you're far from your tools—like, say, when you're up a ladder. —J.D. Tuccille, contributing editor Buy the Wave+ for $95.96 Do you have a home improvement novice in your life? Or perhaps you live with someone you want to subtly nudge in that direction? When I started buying power tools, it was hard to decide what to get first. So many tools. So many different jobs. Where does one begin? Let me suggest that a reciprocating saw is a great gateway drug. Commonly known under the umbrella term Sawzall, there are many good reciprocating saws on the market. I buy RYOBI tools because they're relatively cheap but good enough for small projects. Plus, I already have the batteries. (Once you buy one cordless power tool, you're locked into the brand for life. The more you know.) A reciprocating saw may not be a precision tool, but it's great for light demolition, renovation, and outdoor work—a.k.a. the starter projects. Mine paid for itself in the money I saved on tree service expenses the first time I used it to take down some branches. This tool is a great middle ground for a certain type of libertarian do-it-yourself enthusiast: those who want some of the self-reliance capitalism provides through affordable tools but are also glad to enjoy the fruits of labor specialization by outsourcing for the bigger projects. —Adam Sullivan, digital marketing specialist Buy the RYOBI One+ Cordless Reciprocating Saw for $53.95 I'm quite certain many of our readers know a guy who luxuriates in the simple pleasure of carrying an entire handbag's worth of things in the pockets of a pair of cargo pants. Certainly everyone I know does because I, myself, am that guy. The problem: Cargo attire is an assault on the eyes. Enter the LA Police Gear (LAPG) Terrain Flex Jeans, a "tactical" option that will give the recipient the gloriously masculine experience without the fashion faux pas that is a pair of cargo pants. The LAPG features a total of eight pockets, two of which are just the right size for standard capacity AR magazines (though I use them for my phone and flashlight/leatherman). For the last few months, I've worn a pair just about every day while still carrying everything I did in my cargo pants—and even more comfortably. Also available in a slim fit. Cargo pants could never. —Ian Keyser, audio engineer Buy LAPG Men's Terrain Flex Tactical Jeans for $39.99-$49.99 If you're shopping for someone who may not have the patience to sit for eons and learn the rules of a complex and intricate board game—Risk, anyone?—Pass the Pigs offers players the thrill and ease of a casino game, with the cuteness of miniature farm animals. What a deal. The game is simple: You roll the pigs and see what body position they land in. Each position—Siders, Trotters, Razorbacks, Snouters, or the big kahuna, Leaning Jowler, where the pig lands on its snout—is worth a certain number of points. The first player to 100 wins. But be careful! The more times you roll in a single turn, the more likely you'll land in a "pig out," which will see you lose all your points. This is a game that allows players to control their destinies—but with plenty of risk and luck involved, too. It's up to you whether you let it ride or play more conservatively. Whoever gets this gift will be in hog heaven. —Justin Zuckerman, producer Buy Pass the Pigs for $14.49 For those eager to avoid some very unmerry partisan snipping with relatives on the other side of the political spectrum this year, you can't do better than by playing a game that treats everything like it's on a spectrum. Wavelength, from CMYK Games, is a family-friendly contest to see who is the best mind reader—and who knows you the best. To start, a player draws a random card with a spectrum written on it: science fiction vs. fantasy, tasty vs. gross, fun vs. boring, etc. They then randomly adjust a speedometerlike dial to a point between the two ends of that spectrum and give their fellow teammates a clue to see if they can correctly guess where the dial landed. It's much easier than it sounds. For example, if you're an outspoken libertarian who draws the card "coercive vs. voluntary," and the dial is set all the way to coercive, you might give "the state" as a clue. If your teammates know you well—and libertarianism well—they'll know the state is as coercive as it gets, guess accordingly, and get all the points possible. If they whiff, they'll miss the points, and you'll know they missed the point of last year's gift: a hardback copy of Anarchy, State, and Utopia. As with any good game of social deduction, the joy of Wavelength comes less from scoring points and moving pieces and more from seeing just how well you know your friends and family and how well they know you. So if you're trying to maintain good and joyous relations with your family during this polarizing Christmas season, gift the game that encourages everyone to be on the same wavelength. —Christian Britschgi, reporter Buy Wavelength for $29.99 I'm usually skeptical about skin care products. My attitude toward this market changed a bit, however, when I discovered Magic Molecule. This hypochlorous acid spray—marketed as an antidote for a slew of skin ailments—lives up to its supernatural name. I whip it out anytime I have a cut on my finger or the occasional oil splatter from cooking. The "magic" moment comes when you realize that your skin wounds not only feel and look better after a couple of hours but have recovered almost entirely by the next day. The company also claims the product promotes healing for eczema, acne, sunburns, rashes, and more. Imagine someone's reaction a mere century or two ago if they were to see what science and the market would come together to provide. Sure, it won't turn you into Wolverine and make you completely invincible this festive season, particularly while you're furiously cooking around the stove. But this is an excellent gift for your friends and family, and may even convert the male skin care skeptic in your life. Practically magic. —Adani Samat, video art director Buy Magic Molecule for $32 For those intrigued by the mind-changing potential of a psychedelic experience, the Shrüm All-in-One Grow Bag from Advanced Mycology offers an easy, approachable way to start a new mushroom-fueled journey. The hassle of tubs, tents, and sterile labs can intimidate any budding mycologist, but this product provides an easy, low-maintenance way to explore a new hobby and cultivate curiosity—no extra space or Ph.D. needed. The bag comes prepped and ready to be injected with liquid culture or spores. It's designed specifically for cubensis mushrooms—otherwise known as magic mushrooms (though legally speaking, this is only a research or novelty product). Couple the Grow Bag with Shrüm Liquid Culture, which comes loaded up with your choice from a trippy menu of varietals such as Albino Penis Envy, Steel Magnolia, and White Jedi Mind Fuck. Shrüm also recently partnered with Mike Tyson on its new MIKEADELICS Mushroom Grow Bag, if you're looking for a heavyweight experience. If you know someone discouraged by the outcome of several drug policy ballot initiatives in the 2024 election, this unique gift can assuage that disappointment. Just read the FAQs on the website and make sure to double-check local laws before getting started. The Shrüm Liquid Culture contains only early-stage mycelium (no psilocybin is present) so what arrives on your doorstep isn't illegal in any state or federally. But since psilocybin develops during the growth process, your journey—or trip, shall we say—may quickly turn illegal, depending on where you live. —Bekah Congdon, deputy managing editor Buy the Shrüm All-in-One Grow Bag for $25 Until lawmakers unshackle the biohackers to eradicate annoying, disease-carrying mosquitoes once and for all, it seems we're stuck coping with itchy bug bites and the scars they can leave behind. As a Florida Man who doesn't love dousing himself with insect repellent just to enjoy a short wooded trail hike or to paddle a stream, I was pleased to discover that capitalism has generated a more elegant solution to the vampiric insect problem: Destroy the bite with heat. The German medical device company Beuerer created the BR60 Insect Bite Healer. It delivers a three-to-six second pulse of 122-degree Fahrenheit heat, which is sufficient to break down the proteins—histamines, tryptase, leukotrienes—present in many insect toxins and salivas. No toxic proteins means no itchiness and swelling. I'll be honest: This is not the most pleasant six seconds you'll ever experience, but no pain, no gain. My family can attest that this remarkable, simple device really works to make mosquito and gnat bites stop itching, like magic—momentarily painful magic, but magic just the same. We haven't (thankfully) yet had a reason to try it on a bee or wasp sting, but reviewers report it's fairly effective there, too. I'm still holding out hope for total mosquito armageddon in my lifetime given promising early results. But until then, I'll be keeping my magical German bug saliva protein-destroyer handy. —Zach Weissmueller, senior producer Buy Beurer Insect Sting and Bite Relief for $23.99 When gift giving, it's not dollar value that matters but sentimental value. (I'll keep telling myself that since I'm a recent college graduate with little discretionary income.) Speaking also as someone who's occupied a lifelong spot on Santa's nice list—just like all Reason readers, I'm sure—I want to show my loved ones that I care. There's no better way to do this than with art. Procure a piece of artwork that reflects their tastes, values, and aesthetic sensibility. One way to do this is to make it yourself. If you go this route, you can rest assured they'll say they love it because you made it with your blood, sweat, and tears, no matter how janky it inevitably looks. Yet if the extent of your artistic expertise begins and ends with finger painting, then you should probably forgo making art yourself. Instead, take them to a museum and determine their favorite work—subtly or otherwise—and record the title and author. The rest is easy: Access a high-resolution photo of the piece, which is usually available on the museum's website; download it (or take a high-resolution screenshot); visit Staples custom poster printing online; upload the image; and choose 7.9 mil semi-gloss photo paper. Pick up the masterpiece from the nearest brick-and-mortar location, frame it, and voilà, you've got yourself a meaningful gift that doesn't leave you penniless. —Jack Nicastro, assistant editor Shop Staples prints We all have that BFF or family member whose walls are tragically plain. Whether we're renting, owning, or squatting, it's a massive mental boost to personalize your corner of this crazy world. This holiday season, you can help your loved ones do just that, courtesy of TaudalpoiDesigns. Taudalpoi is a Norwegian digital artist whose work consists of "retro-futuristic, vintage and surreal collage art." There's something for the young, the old, and the in-between: The work often marries a 1950s-esque aesthetic with futuristic themes, like this piece—which goes for $18 but as of this writing is just $12.60—depicting vintage cars parked on the moon. (Hey, maybe one day.) It's a celebration of how far we've come, and how far we still have to go—"a blend of eras," the artist writes, and "a journey through time and imagination." Just a few decades ago, buying art was mostly limited to attending shows and fairs. In 2024, distinctive artists like Taudalpoi are just a click away on Etsy, and for an incredibly reasonable price. Mosey on over and snag something original for your people. —Regan Taylor, video editor Shop Taudalpoi Designs If you're shopping for an amateur culinary artist but don't won't drain your bank account, consider the Tensyu kitchen knife. I won't pretend these knives are amazing. They're mass-produced somewhere in Japan as cheaply as humanly possible—perhaps from the leftover bits of steel used to make higher-quality knives. That's its selling point, though. Because just as every kitchen should have a set of premium knives, every kitchen should also have some trusty beater knives to rely on when you need a hardy backup. And the Tensyu kitchen knife is a solid, inexpensive backup. Tensyu offers six knife types, ranging from the classic santoku to the small but versatile petty knife. Each instrument is constructed with a stainless steel blade attached firmly to an ergonomic handle available in either wood or plastic. I own three of these knives, and each one has maintained a sharp edge with minimal maintenance. The downside is that I've only seen them available in-store at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. So to purchase one you have to temporarily eschew the wonders of shopping from your couch and do it the old-fashioned way: by leaving your home and driving to a brick-and-mortar store. And if the low price point is what's most enticing to you here, you better act fast. These aren't made in the U.S., so someone might slap a tariff on them soon. —Cody Huff, post-production supervisor Find your nearest T.J. Maxx Belgian painter René Magritte's The Empire of Light—a gorgeous surrealist work juxtaposing a nocturnal streetscape below a bright blue daytime sky—sold for more than $121 million at a Christie's auction in mid-November. The sale made Magritte the 16th artist to have a work sell for over nine figures and signals that the market is finally recognizing his brilliance. You probably don't have that kind of cash on hand for a holiday gift, but thankfully the market provides more affordable alternatives too. The online shop for the Magritte Museum in Brussels offers a wide variety of excellent gift options. A framed print of The Empire of Light can be yours for just €20, plus shipping—quite the bang for the buck when considering it is 99.99 percent below the auction price. Or grab a coffee mug bearing the likeness of The Treachery of Images, probably Magritte's most well-known work: a painting of a pipe above the written phrase "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" ("This is not a pipe"). Get it? It makes sense that surrealism would be enjoying a bit of a moment right now in these topsy-turvy times. Gift accordingly. —Eric Boehm, reporter Shop the Magitte Museum Listen, I know fancy new Apple AirPods are pretty spendy at $249, but hear me out on a specific use case. Are there older people in your life who can't hear but don't think they need hearing aids? It's a tale as old as time. Get them the new AirPods Pro 2. On Christmas morning, it will seem like a cool tech gift. But you'll know that it's actually a stealth medical device. Thanks to the deregulation of over-the-counter hearing aids, Apple can more safely lean into the market and now touts "clinical grade Hearing Aid capability" for its latest in-ear headphones, with a free software upgrade. As Apple notes: "Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are regulated health features and will be offered after authorization is received," but thankfully the U.S. is listed as an approved region. At the very least, the recipient will enjoy cool, super tiny speakers of better quality than they've probably ever experienced. And thanks to deregulation and globalization, maybe grandpa will be able to hear the kids' squeals of joy next Christmas, too. —Katherine Mangu-Ward, editor in chief Buy the AirPods Pro 2 for $249 After 16 years, 175,000 miles, and two tow trips, my 2008 Toyota RAV4 had seen better days. (May it rest in peace.) A creature of habit, I went to the local Toyota dealership to get the updated model—but was shocked by the price tag ($60,000!). So I decided to look elsewhere. To my surprise, I ended up in a Tesla showroom. I wouldn't say I'm an Elon Musk fangirl. But in my search, I found that Teslas have superior safety technology compared with other options on the market—and for a more affordable price. (It's also fun that my new toy can park itself and be summoned at the push of a button.) At the end of the day, I spent about $48,000—I went with the Model Y—to buy a car that won't be outdated anytime soon; meanwhile, I've already saved hundreds of dollars that I would have spent on gas, and the electrical vehicle tax rebate offers additional money in my pocket. The latter is a dumb perk, to be sure, but we already pay the government too much money. May as well get some back where you can. Gifting a car is obviously a big commitment, so this idea is probably limited to, say, spouses and children. But it's the perfect surprise for the loved one in your life who appreciates the power of innovation—remember when a fully electric vehicle sounded like something from a science fiction novel?—and who needs a stylish new ride. Full speed ahead. —Natalie Dowzicky, managing editor of video and podcasts Shop Tesla In the wake of spicy school board showdowns and pandemic-era remote learning, homeschooling is on the rise. So it stands to reason that you may have a homeschooler or two on your gift list. If that's the case, a Little Passports subscription box makes the perfect gift for homeschooled kiddos—or any kid who loves to learn outside of traditional state-regulated structures. With varied offerings for ages three to 10, these monthly boxes contain fun and educational projects, chapter books, and activities that cover a lot of territory to correspond with your child's interests. Theme options include: Science Expeditions, World Adventures, Space Quest, Craft Discovery, and more. You can gift a subscription for six months, 12 months, or a month at a time. My little one isn't quite school age, but my husband and I—both of us homeschool veterans of the 1990s—plan to teach her at home. So I've been on the lookout for innovative ways to foster a love of learning from an early age, and I can't wait to try Little Passports. Kids will enjoy a new surprise waiting for them in the mailbox every month. But this gift isn't just for them, as homeschooling moms and dads will definitely appreciate an activity—ahem, learning module—that they don't have to plan. —Danielle Thompson, senior video editor Shop Little Passports Kids like to ask a lot of tough questions. "What if you drained all the water out of the oceans? Or put a submarine in outer space? What if you turned off the sun? Or took all the DNA out of a person?" Suffice to say those queries are difficult for a layman to address. Thankfully cartoonist and former NASA engineer Randall Munroe has the answers that parents are looking for with the latest book in his What If? series—the 10th Anniversary Edition—which offers "serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions." But this book is not just for inquisitive children and their parents. Although the explanations are easy to digest, they're not condescending. Munroe walks readers through exactly how they would go about finding the answers to these hypotheticals, as well as the real connections they have to science. For precocious kids and free-thinking adults alike, What If? 10th Anniversary Edition is a reminder that there are no stupid questions—and that human imagination need not be limited by the laws of nature or how many trips you've taken around the sun. —Matthew Petti, assistant editor Buy What If? 10th Anniversary Edition for $27.16 If a real-life Grinch gets his way, there are going to be fewer toys under the tree in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump is considering tariff policies that will raise the prices of many products, but toys will be among the hardest hit. The National Retail Federation analyzed two possible tariff hikes. Under one, "a universal tariff of 10% or even 20% on all imports into the United States from all countries," consumer prices on toys would rise 36.3 percent. Under the other, "an additional tariff of 60% or even 100% on all imports from China on top of existing tariffs," toy prices rise 55.8 percent. With price hikes like that affecting the whole economy, Trump is arguably worse than the Grinch. The Grinch learned the error of his ways in the end. Will Trump? We can't count on it. So before likely tariff hikes raise prices next year, it's a great time to buy toys from the Chinese company VTech. Some of their toys are branded with popular kids shows like Bluey, CoComelon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. None of those shows are perfectly libertarian—let's pump the brakes on the cartoon police state, shall we?—but we live in a society. For a more libertarian toy, try their Jiggle and Giggle Fishing Set—teach a child to fish, and they can feed themselves for the rest of their lives without having to worry about food tariffs, agriculture subsidies, or regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (though annual state fishing licenses seem like a scam). The Smart Wheels Train Station Playset might be nice at teaching them early on that trains are for transporting cargo, not long-haul intercity passenger routes. As for me, I'll be getting my son the Smart Shots Sports Center. Maybe it will instill in him a belief that competition makes us all better off. Or maybe he'll spend months teething on the little soccer ball. Who can say? —Jason Russell, managing editor Shop VTech While the college culture war seems never-ending, there's one thing that may unite students from a slew of American universities, no matter where those institutions happen to fall on the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) free speech rankings: Kyle Cavan's college architecture–inspired necklaces and earrings. Cavan's line of jewelry, based on intricate reproductions of iconic campus landmarks, makes the perfect gift for the college student in your life—or anyone else who basks in the glory of their college days a tad too much. These chic necklaces and earrings offer an understated way to flaunt your college pride, consistently trumping the kitschy logo-laden offerings in most university bookstores. They're subtle and sophisticated enough to feel at home in the quad of a New England liberal arts college and on Bama RushTok. His little pieces of swag cover a wide range of big schools, from Auburn to Villanova, though you probably won't find an option for smaller universities. My own necklace of the University of Virginia rotunda constantly attracts compliments both from fellow UVA alumni and people who are just fond of Mr. Jefferson's University, which recently took the top spot in FIRE's rankings. Free speech, but make it fashion. —Emma Camp, associate editor Shop Kyle Cavan Looking for the perfect gift for your favorite freedom lover who spends way too much time sitting and tweeting about abolishing the Fed? As a libertarian who's learned the hard way that the invisible hand doesn't prevent blood clots, let me suggest something unexpectedly practical: Vim & Vigor compression socks. I know, I know—compression socks sound about as exciting as a lecture by a Keynesian on the high value of a spending multiplier. But hear me out, fellow liberty enthusiasts: These aren't your grandmother's medical stockings that scream "I've given up on life and fashion simultaneously." These bad boys come in stylish and sometimes zany patterns that your loved one can don to express their individuality. (They don't yet come in cryptocurrency motifs, but a girl can dream.) Practical and fashionable. Unlike government programs, they deliver what they promise. Plus, nothing says "personal responsibility" quite like preventing a pulmonary embolism. —Veronique de Rugy, contributing editor Shop Vim & Vigor Chances are many readers are at least somewhat familiar with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the iconic novel by Mark Twain. James, the new National Book Award–winning bestselling book by Percival Everett, is a sharp reworking of that classic tale from the point of view of Huck's friend, the escaped enslaved man Jim. A modern counterpart to Twain's, Everett's engrossing novel reexamines themes of liberty, race, conscience, and friendship through a contemporary, often satirical lens, 140 years after the original was published. This journey of self-emancipation will be enjoyed by all the lovers of liberty on your Christmas gift list. —Ronald Bailey, science correspondent Buy James for $28 Have a bookworm on your list who's seemingly read everything? If so, you can't go wrong with something from Melville House, an independent publisher that puts out beautiful but nonfussy and affordable works that offer something new even for the most voracious reader. I'm especially a fan of Melville's Neversink, Last Interview, and Art of the Novella series. The Neversink line focuses on "books from around the world that have been overlooked, under appreciated, looked askance at, or foolishly ignored," including literature and nonfiction. Think a 1958 "masterpiece of psychological suspense and a probing account of the decline of power" (The President) from French mystery master Georges Simenon; a now-forgotten 1902 memoir (I Await the Devil's Coming) that propelled 19-year-old author, Mary MacLane—the "Wild Woman of Butte"—to celebrity when it was published; surrealist Mina Loy's novel "about an impossible friendship amid the glamorous artistic bohemia of 1930s Paris" (Insel, unpublished during Loy's lifetime); or a 1937 novel "set among the dusty lanes and rolling valleys of rural 1930s Belgium" (La Femme de Gilles) from feminist writer and Nazi resister Madeleine Bourdouxhe. For the people-person, books in the Last Interview series each feature a curated collection of interviews—including the last known interview—with a different dead public figure (writers, actors, political figures, musicians, and more). There are now 41 books in this line, with subjects as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut, Hannah Arendt, Ernest Hemingway, Lou Reed, Anthony Bourdain, Ursula K. Le Guin, Billie Holiday, Joan Didion, Kurt Cobain, and bell hooks. Meanwhile, the Art of the Novella series includes 58 works of "this renegade art form"—some never previously printed in book form—including not-so-well-known novellas by well-known writers like Mary Shelley, Mark Twain, Anton Chekhov, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Charles Baudelaire, and Virginia Woolf. The thread tying together all of these series seems to be an appreciation for the great wealth and diversity of creative and intellectual products hidden in recent history and a dedication to preserving these endeavors for our current era. There's something here for all sorts of readers but especially those who like to uncover hidden gems from another culture or an earlier time. —Elizabeth Nolan Brown, senior editor Shop Melville House An aging empire cracking at its foundation. An elite political class out of touch with its citizens. Epic fights over energy and the fuel that powers civilization. A cult of political personality, and a demagogue eager to exploit it. No, I'm not describing America and the 2024 election. I'm talking about a desert planet called Arakis and the intergalactic battle over its most precious resource, spice, in the second part of director Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic, Dune. Villeneuve's big-screen adaptation split the first book of Herbert's series into two parts (there's a third on the way), with the second telling the story of a young man's quest to take revenge on an emperor who killed his father and stripped his family of power. Herbert's 1965 novel was a sort of environmentalist epic with an undercurrent of concern about the abuse of technology and political power. Villeneuve's movie version turns that undercurrent into a major theme, playing up the story's warnings about cults of political personality. Like Villeneuve's previous science fiction projects—Arrival, Blade Runner 2049—Dune Part Two is a triumph of big-screen, big-budget filmmaking. The 4K Ultra disc presents the movie's stark, shadowy images in gorgeously crunchy high contrast, and gives the movie's rousing score a pulsing clarity—creating an experience that rivals a movie theater from the comfort of your home. It's big. It's loud. It's a warning. It's a great movie. —Peter Suderman, features editor Buy Dune: Part Two 4K Ultra HD for $12.99 The freewheeling freedom of American culture offers a seemingly limitless supply of options for people seeking fellowship and understanding; a chance to experiment creatively or participate in unique experiences; or just a place in the world that feels like theirs. Comedian Moshe Kasher has been placed or chosen to embed himself in at least six of America's distinct subcultures, whose joys and annoyances he writes about in Subculture Vulture: A Memoir in Six Scenes with a clear, acidic, and funny eye that neither forgets what these specific worlds have given him nor ignores what can be troublesome or silly about them. Some of the subcultures he found himself in by birth—"The Jews" and "Deafness" as he calls them (both his parents are deaf, though he is not)—and some by choice (raves, Burning Man). Another one is his career—comedy—and one is his attempt to cope with the results of other bad choices: Alcoholics Anonymous. For all of them, Kasher provides an educated history of the cultures deftly and hilariously, buttressed by his personal experiences. If you know anyone contemplating lifestyle choices that will make some of these subcultures relevant, Kasher's book might provide either encouragement or a hefty dose of scared straight. He regrets that the internet changed the cultural dynamics that he moved in in the 1990s and early 21st century, which he thinks were vital to creating such a rich variety of scenes to move through. But the vast variety of unique ways to define one's identity is a core part of America that will almost certainly survive the web age. —Brian Doherty, senior editor Buy Subculture Vulture: A Memoir in Six Scenes for $21.30 Christmas gifts are the warm-up act for New Year's resolutions no one keeps. So what better than a notebook to jot down all those goals you'll guilt-read at the end of the year? Or maybe—just maybe—this upcoming year will be different. I know, I know, you've heard that refrain before. But consider that the classic 365-page planners set people up to fail when folks inevitably forget to write something during the first week of January. Instead, try the more forgiving 251-page notebook from LEUCHTTURM1917. Its lineup offers plenty of options, but I highly recommend dotted paper. If you or your loved one are highly visual people, lined pages feel like a prison. There's nothing better than the freedom to create your layouts, write, or draw (but not too much freedom—we don't want blank pages staring back at you, making it impossible to know where to begin). This product also comes with several perforated sheets for easy removal, as well as stickers for archiving. This holiday season, you don't have to break the bank to gift some self-improvement—priceless—whether you're shopping for a stoic bro or a tortured poet. —Cesar Baez, producer Buy the LEUCHTTURM1917 Medium Notebook for $24.69 We've all heard a variation of that cliche: It's not the gift but the thought that counts. This time, it's not the gift but the paper it's wrapped in. Consider covering that waffle maker or whatever forlorn kitchen appliance you're giving your aunt in this elegant bitcoin wrapping paper. Consider covering that waffle maker or whatever forlorn kitchen appliance you're giving your aunt in this elegant bitcoin wrapping paper. If the recipient hits you with the classic, "This wrapping paper is so pretty. I almost don't want to unwrap it!" then you have your perfect opening to give your crypto elevator speech. And if the recipient doesn't compliment the wrapping paper, then, well, you know it's high time to show them the light about the O.G. peer-to-peer, permissionless digital currency. Fresh off a milestone year that saw the asset's price reach all-time highs—and saw the Securities and Exchange Commission approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds—bitcoin is in some sense just getting started. I can't vouch for the wrapping paper's quality. But should it turn out to not be worth the paper it's printed on—much like fiat currency—don't fret. Because the paper itself isn't the point; the conversation is. And if you succeed in getting Aunt Betty to acquire a few satoshis, the smallest unit of bitcoin cryptocurrency, perhaps she'll be the one evangelizing this time next year. After all, who needs a new waffle iron if we're finally going to the moon? —Hunt Beaty, podcast producer Buy Bitcoin wrapping paper for $5.28 My records show that I bought the Vintorio Wine Aerator Pourer five times, so I must have really liked it. I did! It was a handy, highly portable way to accomplish something that used to require a decanter, other cumbersome equipment, or a lot of pretentious swirling. And it was cheap: just 18 bucks from Amazon. But it was also cheap in another way: It featured little plastic tabs that were crucial to maintaining its integrity but tended to break off when you dropped it on a hard floor. Apparently, I did that repeatedly. (Mind you, this would have been prior to any imbibing, so it reflects my completely unintoxicated clumsiness.) I finally wised up and sprang for the more expensive but much sturdier TRIbella Classic Wine Aerator, which originally cost $40 but is currently going for $32 on Amazon. This aerator consists of three stainless steel tubes embedded in hard plastic surrounded by rubber that allows it to fit snugly in the neck of a wine bottle. At the bottom is another longer and thinner tube through which the wine flows into the aerator, and the shell has an opening that lets air in as you pour. The resulting three-stream emission is both aesthetically pleasing and highly efficient at mingling the wine with the air. Does it even matter? I think it does, although I confess that I have never done a blind taste test. This is probably not a gift for someone who needs to be convinced that aeration makes wine taste better, but it is an excellent choice for friends or relatives who already believe that and would welcome an easier way to accomplish the transformation—especially if they're accident-prone even when stone-cold sober. —Jacob Sullum, senior editor Buy the TRIbella Classic Wine Aerator for $31.99 In college, we used to smoke cannabis by taking knife hits—where you extract smoke by pressing flower between two heated knives—into frosty mugs. Then we'd sit back and sip the smoke. It seemed like an economical way to get lit and always made for great photos. Thankfully my DIY college era is over (which is convenient, as I burned through my butter knives). But the memory lives on with Zenco Duo. The Zenco Duo vaporizer is a new way to elevate your social session. It works with 510 thread cartridges, dry herbs, and concentrates—so there's something for everyone. There are four adjustable heat settings; you simply press the button and the glass attachment fills with smoke for quick, smooth hits. (Much more high-tech than my days at school.) The Zenco Duo also comes with two glass attachments, a concentrate scoop, a USB charger, and the cleaning essentials. But my favorite part is the glassware you can buy to complement your Duo. Their coffee mug pairs well with a morning smoke, the flow is filled with water for more filtration, and the sommelier glass is perfect for my kind of "wine" night. So now when someone asks if I want to grab drinks, I bring my Zenco Duo and skip the hangover. Cheers. —Bess Byers, digital marketing specialist Buy the Zenco Duo for $249 In a country where the joy of junk food is allegedly under threat from the incoming secretary of health and human services, I have the secret weapon gift for your loved ones who savor a good snack. A Costco membership. As additional health regulations loom, stockpiling your favorite goodies may become a strategic necessity. Someone may want to hoard their gummy bears, made of colorful dyes and that sweet, sweet high-fructose corn syrup. A membership at Costco will put people one step ahead of the flavor police, ensuring access to a steady supply of guilty pleasures at low, low prices. And let's not forget about dental hygiene. Because after savoring those salty and sugary delights, you'll need a strong defense against cavities. Stock up on your fluoride rinse before it's eliminated from the water supply. Give the gift of delicious defiance—and a side of dental hygiene—with a Costco membership, the ultimate middle finger to the nutrition nanny-staters. —John Carter, producer Buy a Costco membership for $65-130 per year The Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks. Power needs for artificial intelligence and cloud computing are expanding so rapidly that some data center campuses may use more electricity than entire cities, or even states, CNBC reports. Here is what Ali Fenn, president of Lancium, a company that secures land and power for data centers had to say about technology companies: "Technology companies are in a “race of a lifetime to global dominance” in artificial intelligence. It’s frankly about national security and economic security. They’re going to keep spending because there’s no more profitable place to deploy capital”. READ NOW: 15 AI Stocks to Watch: News and Analyst Ratings and 9 Buzzing AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News As such, it is important to note that renewable energy isn’t going to be enough to meet their power needs. According to developers, natural gas will also have to play a role. In turn, this need will slow down the progress towards meeting carbon dioxide emission targets. Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure, and power resources for such facilities, further reveals how data center companies have already begun operating at a scale where they have started “tapping out against the existing utility infrastructure”. In other news, Uber is reportedly building a fleet of gig workers for labeling data for AI models. The new data labeling division, known as Scaled Solutions, will have workers complete projects for the company's internal business units as well as serve outside customers, including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic, according to a report from Bloomberg. The ride-hailing company has started recruiting contractors in countries including the U.S., Canada, and India, among others. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A group of software engineers working in an open, futuristic office. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47 On November 25, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC), known as the search-focused AI company, announced that it is expanding its partnership with Amazon Web Services. The expanded partnership will leverage AWS’s latest generative artificial intelligence (AI) services. Through the collaboration, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) will be offering large language model (LLM) observability support for Amazon Bedrock in Elastic Observability. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that builds generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) will be able to track insights into their Amazon Bedrock LLMs performance and usage; helping prevent issues and improve performance for their Amazon Bedrock-powered generative AI applications. Moreover, Elastic's AI Assistant, which is also powered by Amazon Bedrock, will offer insights, visualizations, and recommendations to help SREs solve problems. “As LLM-based applications are growing, it’s essential for developers and SREs to be able to monitor, optimize, and troubleshoot how they perform. Today’s integration simplifies the collection of metrics and logs from Amazon Bedrock, in turn streamlining the process of gaining valuable and actionable insights.” Overall ESTC ranks 11th on our list of the buzzing AI stocks that are making headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ESTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Pantera Capital’s Bitcoin Fund Achieves 131,000% Lifetime Return
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/pantera-capitals-bitcoin-fund-achieves-131000-lifetime-return/
Time Published: 2024-11-28T15:16:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital has revealed in a new post that its Patnera Bitcoin Fund’s lifetime return has recently topped 131,000% net of fees and expenses after the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin surged to near $100,000 after the US elections. In the post, Pantera Capital’s CEO Dan Morehead shared an email forecasting back in July 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at $65, that the “bitcoin washout happened” and predicting the price of the cryptocurrency would surge over time. The email notes he was going to “buy 30,000 bitcoins” with his own personal money at a time in which the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization was around $740 million. Given the small size of the cryptocurrency market at the time, Morehead noted that in 2013-15, the fund “bought 2% of the world’s bitcoins.” To Morehead, buying Bitcoin at the time was like “buying gold in 1000 B.C.” as then “99% of the financial wealth has yet to address bitcoin.” He noted that the industry has made progress and now believes 95% of the financial wealth “has yet to put their full-sized position on.” The CEO added that the catalyst for the figure to keep on dropping has “just happened: regulatory clarity in the United States” at a time in which massive “institutional managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are now offering incredibly cheap, efficient access to anyone with a brokerage account. “ As a result, he predicted the price of Bitcoin will move to $740,000 per coin, up from its current level around $95,000. The surge would see Bitcoin’s total market capitalization hit $15 trillion, which to Morehead isn’t an inconceivable number relative to the $500 trillion in financial assets. Per his words if Bitcoin’s price growth were to continue it would hit the $740,000 mark in April 2028. Featured image via Unsplash.

Title: The S&P 500 will climb 10% to 6,600 next year as earnings and the economy stay strong, Barclays says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-index-target-us-economy-consumer-barclays-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-28T13:45:01Z
Full Content:
The S&P 500 is primed to continue its bull rally in 2025, though at a slightly slower pace, Barclays strategists said in an outlook published this week. The strategists, led by the firm's head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna, predict the index will climb another 10% to 6,600 next year, propelled by strong tech earnings growth and a resilient economy. Their forecast marks a slowdown index's 26% gain so far this year, but they're bullish that the economic environment will continue to prop up the stock market. "Macro slowing to still-healthy levels should support more US equity upside next year, albeit a deceleration from '23-'24's breakneck pace. Positioning looks constructive, and policy uncertainty creates room for stock and sector selection," the analysts said in a Monday note. Much of their optimism lies in the robust US economy, which remains strong as consumers—the "central pillar" of the US economy and stock market—enjoy income gains and continue to open their wallets, they said. "The US economy remains resilient thanks to the still-intact 'virtuous cycle' between rising aggregate incomes and consumption," the analysts wrote. "Concerns around household financial distress appear overblown; overall delinquency rates remain low and borrowers, as a whole, are burdened with less consumer and revolving credit, as a percentage of income, than prior to the pandemic," they added. They also point to strong earnings growth potential for Big Tech stocks, which they say Wall Street is likely underestimating by 12%. They acknowledge, though, that there are some risks stemming from companies' massive AI investments and investors' eagerness to soon see a return. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows that tech giants like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have already invested hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure and are poised to spend another $200 billion next year. The analysts say inflation also poses a risk, especially if President-elect Donald Trump implements his proposals for sweeping tariffs and a crackdown on immigration, both of which would drive up prices through 2026, the analysts say. That could prompt fewer rate cuts from the Federal Reserve than markets are expecting, adding a hurdle for stocks, they added. "The risk to equities is not insignificant, especially since Treasury yields are up sharply since September and are approaching levels at which they've historically been a headwind for equities, which could be problematic in the event of fiscal expansion and fewer rate cuts," the analysts said. They added, though, that the policy roadmap remains uncertain and markets have typically weathered inflation and rates well in recent years. Barclays joins other big banks in forecasting continued gains in 2025, and the mood is decidedly bullish even as policy and geopolitical headwinds swirl. RBC analysts predicted the S&P 500 will hit 6,600 points on Monday, while strategists at Deutsche Bank set a target of 7,000. Last week, analysts at BMO said the index will hit 6,700 next year.

WIRED's Cyber Monday 2024 Coverage Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata This Panasonic 4K Blu-Ray player supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, which makes it fully optimized for getting the most out of your discs. I like how simple and easy to use these players are, although they do have software that feels a bit like it was coded 20 years ago. Discs look way better than streaming content in most cases, so a solid deal on this player is a must if you’re looking to see your favorite content in the best possible quality. —Parker Hall Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar Apple’s latest iPad Pro tablet (6/10, WIRED Review) has several new features. It packs a bigger and brighter display, an upgraded OLED screen, and the front-facing camera has landscape mode. Under the hood is the latest M4 chip, which delivers snappy performance. It’s also compatible with a variety of new accessories including Magic Keyboard Case, Apple Pencil Pro, and Smart Folio case. However, we still recommend the 2022 M2-powered iPad Pro. It’s a great alternative if you want to save even more cash. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite iPad (7/10, WIRED Review) to recommend to most people. It’s powered by the A14 Bionic chip, which is the same one you’ll find in the iPhone 12, that never felt sluggish in our testing. It has a modernized design too, with slim bezels around a larger 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (IPS LCD) display, along with a USB-C port for charging, Touch ID in the power button, and a 12-megapixel selfie camera that’s been moved to the center of the iPad. It comes with support for the first-gen stylus or the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the Magic Keyboard Folio and the original Smart Folio case. —Brenda Stolyar Apple’s latest iPad Pro tablet (6/10, WIRED Review) has several new features. It packs a bigger and brighter display, an upgraded OLED screen, and the front-facing camera has landscape mode. Under the hood is the latest M4 chip, which delivers snappy performance. It’s also compatible with a variety of new accessories including Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro, and Smart Folio case. However, we still recommend the 2022 M2-powered iPad Pro. So, it’s a great alternative if you want to save even more cash. —Brenda Stolyar The first-generation Apple Pencil has been around for years now, but it’s still a solid option. It packs features like pressure sensitivity (the lines get thicker as you press harder on the display), tilt sensitivity (for shading), and handwriting support within apps and search fields. As for supported iPads, it works with the base model iPad (6th Gen and later), iPad Mini (5th Gen), the iPad Air (3rd Gen), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st and 2nd Gen), and iPad Pro 10.5-inch. It reaches this price often, but it’s still a good deal. —Brenda Stolyar The second-gen Apple Pencil packs a variety of features including pressure sensitivity, handwriting support, tilt sensitivity, and double-tap (which lets you switch quickly between tools by tapping the stylus twice). It has support for wireless pairing and wireless charging too, so you can magnetically connect it to the top edge of the iPad and it’ll automatically start charging. As for supported iPads, it works with the iPad Mini (6th gen), iPad Air (4th gen and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen and later), and the 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later). It's not compatible with the iPad Air (M2) or iPad Pro (M4) though. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar The Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a large 27-inch screen that’s great for getting work done. I’ve been using it alongside the M4-powered MacBook Pro daily. It doesn’t have HDR, which means colors look a bit more saturated and contrasty to the neutral tones you’ll find on Apple’s Pro Display XDR. But the 5K resolution is stunning and sharp. Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s a great monitor that comes complete with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers. —Brenda Stolyar This is the next step up from the MacBook Air with M3. It has three USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 (up from two on its predecessor) along with an SD card slot, HDMI port, high-impedance headphone jack, and MagSafe charging port. Apple also increased the memory on the base model from 8 gigabytes to 16 gigabytes. For an extra cost, you can add a nano-texture display too. You can also configure it with an M4 Pro or M4 Max for more power—both of which are also on sale. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar The M3-powered MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Macbook for most people. It has a nice 13.6-inch LCD screen and 1080p webcam while the M3 delivers a solid boost in performance compared to the M1 chip. It’s mainly great for everyday tasks but is certainly capable of handling a bit more like basic video editing or photo editing. Thanks to the M3, you can also use it with two external displays—the older chips only support a single display. —Brenda Stolyar Even though I have the M4-powered MacBook Pro at my disposal, I still reach for the 15-inch MacBook Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to use as my daily driver. It’s an excellent choice if you want a bigger screen without all the Pro features. It has the same modern build as the smaller model too, as well as a 1080p webcam and M3 chip. It works great for all my tasks, including word processing, video calls, sending emails, web browsing, and streaming content. For smoother performance, I suggest going for the 16 GB of unified memory. —Brenda Stolyar The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best option for ultimate power (7/10, WIRED Review). As with its predecessor, you’ll get a Mini-LED screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate, 1080p webcam, and a six-speaker sound system. This time around, Apple upgraded the USB ports with support for Thunderbolt 5 (120 Gbps/sec), giving you faster data transfer speeds. We tested the M4 Pro, which is a bit faster than last year’s M3 max chip, but it’s still capable of handling anything you throw at it. For even more power, you can pair it with the M4 Max. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar Having a proper ergonomic mouse can make a huge difference in your daily life, which is why we recommend the Logitech Lift for Mac, a vertically oriented mouse for Apple devices of all shapes and sizes. The vertical orientation puts your hand in a different position that some people may find more comfortable than a typical mouse, especially if you use your system for long periods at a time. It doesn’t cut where it counts though, with long battery life, a quiet magnetic scroll wheel, and a wide range of DPI settings to adjust to your liking. —Brad Bourque Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This excellent 3-in-1 charger for your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch is one of the best MagSafe chargers around. You can fold it away to a very compact size, making it an ideal travel companion. Charging for your iPhone goes up to 15 watts via a magnetic pad that can adjust to your preferred angle. There’s another pad for AirPods or other wireless earbuds, and a fold-out Apple Watch charger on the back. A 5-foot USB-C cable and wall adapter are included. —Simon Hill This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Magna-Tiles may be expensive (a little less expensive now), but the return on investment is just staggering. We bought our daughter’s first set when she was 2 or 3 and enjoyed making little 2D ice cream cones or hats. Now she’s 9 and can make full villages for stuffed animals in the course of an afternoon. There are also a ton of different themed sets (also on sale) if you need more specialized pieces for race courses or jungles. —Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So Any building toy is great for encouraging creativity and hand-eye coordination, and WIRED reviewer Simon Hill’s whole family found the Clixo sets to be irresistible. The pieces are durable, flexible, washable, and colorful, and you don’t need a flat surface to build so you can play with them anywhere. They also come in themed sets that have glow-in-the-dark pieces. —Adrienne So If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill Tacto is an app with physical pieces that convert your iPad, Android, or Fire tablet into a game board. With Tacto Chess, your kids can learn the basics, from how the pieces move to strategies for victory. The animated app features friendly voice acting and stories, chess puzzles to solve, a move predictor, and your child can play against AI or another person. My kids had some fun with this when they were learning, and it helped them understand chess a little better. This appears in our Best STEM Toys for Kids guide. —Simon Hill These markers are currently en route to my house to test for an upcoming gift guide update. They’ve gone exceedingly viral on TikTok and I can’t wait to get my hands on them. But generally, across the internet, they’ve got positive reviews. Each marker has a brush tip and a fineliner tip. You’ll get 120 colors, a swatch card, and a carrying case. Consider pairing them with a cozy coloring book (also en route to my house!) for hours of fun this winter. —Louryn Strampe I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is currently holding a sitewide Cyber Monday sale for 40 percent off. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals My quest to find the best portable chargers has led me to test hundreds of power banks, but this is my current favorite. I love the look of this transparent, prism-shaped device, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an IP66 rating for water resistance. It will fast charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. I have once seen it slightly cheaper, but this is a good price. —Simon Hill This is one of the best portable power stations for camping or road trips because it’s a manageable size. EcoFlow’s River 2 Pro has a LiFeP04 battery inside, which is good for 768 watt-hours. It has all the ports you need to charge your phones and other small gadgets, and the X-Boost surge enables it to power small appliances. You can charge it from an outlet or solar panels, though it takes more than an hour, and the fan can get a little noisy. —Simon Hill The Anker 737 is the upgrade pick in our best portable chargers guide. With a whopping 24,000 mAh capacity, support for power delivery 3.1, and the ability to send or receive up to 140 watts, this is the only power bank you need. It weighs nearly 1.4 pounds but is fairly compact, considering how much power it holds. A smart digital display shows battery percentage, and you can tap the power button to cycle through stats, including the temperature, total output, and more. This versatile portable charger fast-charged everything I tested and can easily juice up three devices at once. —Simon Hill Anker’s 657 charging station is an excellent charging station for those who charge a lot of devices simultaneously but also want to keep their floor and drawers tidy. It packs six electrical outlet plugs (three on each side) and two USB-C ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) that you can plug more cables into. But that’s not all. It also comes with two USB-C cables that support fast charging, which is great for your phone or laptop. It’s a great accessory to keep at the office, at home, or anywhere you use multiple gadgets at once. —Brenda Stolyar If you have multiple Apple gadgets, this T-shaped wireless charger makes it easy to charge them simultaneously. It suspends your iPhone (at 15-watt charging speed) and Apple Watch midair, while the rounded base charges your AirPods Pro or AirPods (with a wireless charging case). This version comes with Qi2 certification, which is the latest standard that enables faster, more efficient magnetic wireless charging. —Brenda Stolyar As a fan of the translucent electronics craze in the 1990s, I was immediately drawn to this power bank. You can see the ports, chips, and rechargeable Samsung Li-ion batteries inside. While an even better Shargeek (now Sharge) device replaced this in our best portable chargers guide, this power bank is still great. A color display shows the voltage, current, and power flowing in or out, and you can dig deeper for more stats. The DC barrel port lets you specify voltage and current for different devices, up to 75 watts, the first USB-C supports PD PPS up to 100 watts, the second offers 30 watts and supports PD 3.0 and Quick Charge 4 standards, and the USB-A port is QC 3.0 at up to 18 watts. —Simon Hill If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar We like Ugreen's 145-watt charger for its very fast charge times. It's compact for the power it provides, though it's not light at 1.1 pounds. You get two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw all 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W. —Scott Gilbertson This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar The first portable power station from DJI can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and has DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can charge phones, power microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with a lot of gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our Best Portable Power Stations guide. —Simon Hill The Qi2 wireless charging standard was developed in partnership with Apple and features MagSafe-like magnetic alignment and speedier iPhone charging rates of up to 15 watts. This power bank can also charge other Qi2 devices (when they appear) and existing Qi devices (just more slowly). This compact power bank also has a handy kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and an LED display that shows power and time to charge. You can attach MagSafe iPhones in portrait or landscape orientation, and it works with Apple’s StandBy mode, making it one of the Best MagSafe Power Banks. —Simon Hill Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill If your life goes well, you never have to use this thing and it just becomes some furniture for your trunk. But lord, what peace of mind if you leave your headlights on during a road trip through Wyoming. This model has saved the skin of a former WIRED reviewer on more than one occasion: a 1,000-amp, 12-volt battery pack with jump leads that’ll juice your battery in a bad situation. It also offers a USB-A port to charge your phone in a pinch, plus a built-in flashlight. This jump starter is often on sale below its list price of $130—but this is a good sale nonetheless. —Matthew Korfhage We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Mill food recycler just might be one of the most idiot-proof ways out there to dispatch food waste for those who don’t have access to municipal compost. Throw in food scraps (even meat!) and the Mill grinds and dries them into odorless, shelf-stable bits overnight. There’s a subscription program where you send the grounds off in the mail to be made into chicken feed, or you can use your grounds in the garden. We didn’t have the greatest success with that when we reviewed it earlier this year (6/10, WIRED Review), but we did find it to be a great device overall. —Kat Merck The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill Long ago, I used to think rice cookers were fundamentally the same. Then I bought my Zojirushi, with its fuzzy logic circuit that measures moisture and adjusts cooking time and temperature accordingly. Now all my rice tastes wonderful. This goes the same way with pilaf, congee, and coconut rice. This is among Zojirushi’s most basic models, but it has served me so well I’ve become a near-constant ambassador. And this is a terrific deal on it. —Matthew Korfhage The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell As seen in our guide to the Best White Elephant Gifts, this funny little tumbler holds both cereal and milk separately to be enjoyed on the go without the cereal becoming soggy. There is a learning curve—small, spherical cereal bits like Cheerios work best; you must block part of the milk hole with your lower lip lest the milk flow outpace the cereal flow; and the whole contraption tends to leak if the lid isn’t twisted on at exactly the right angle. However, it’s available in seven different colors and makes a great gag gift or stocking stuffer for someone who either loves cereal or never has time to eat breakfast. —Kat Merck Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty Cyber Monday discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane Breville’s Smart Oven Pro air fryer and toaster oven is a remarkably versatile device, even among the new generation of combo ovens we’ve tested. It’ll roast you a 14-pound turkey. It’ll make pounds of less-greasy french fries or wings. It bakes cookies. And it fares surprisingly well at not just reheating pizza, but also making it in the first place. —Matthew Korfhage These aprons from Hedley & Bennett are the sort you might expect to find in professional kitchens—sturdy and waxed, and able to withstand a significant spill without leaving you with a wet belly button. They make great gifts—especially the themed aprons ranging from cutesy bagel aprons to surprisingly thoughtful Star Wars aprons. The whole site is 20 percent off for Cyber Monday, and you'll see the discount once the apron is in your cart. —Matthew Korfhage This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe We like this budget-friendly food dehydrator and think it offers the best bang for your buck out of all the models we tested. The stackable BPA-free plastic rings are a little bulky and awkward to fit in the dishwasher, but everything we dehydrated dried evenly. If you don’t want to drop a ton of money on a food dehydrator, but you want one that works efficiently, this is a model worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe The Ninja Thirsti is a soda maker with a twist—a specialization in fruit-flavored sodas chockablock with caffeine and energizing B-vitamins and everything else that fills your day with pep. Flavors include watermelon lime, strawberry kiwi, lemonade, and dragonfruit. While we might like a SodaStream best for its ease of use, this device comes in at a low price even before the discount. —Matthew Korfhage This deal is on the subscribe and save option. We ranked 30 different energy drinks, and this one came in at No. 11. It’s got a nice little kick that levels off after about half an hour. WIRED contributor Pete Cottell says it’s a solid hangover aid. With 160 milligrams of caffeine and only 10 calories, this is a good option if you want something that tastes good and gently boosts you without making your heart feel the way dubstep sounds. —Louryn Strampe Milk comes from a cow. Or, in this case, an Almond Cow. From nuts and water, this specialized grinder and mixer makes enough delicious, frothy nut milk for a family’s worth of coffee, after just a few minutes of blending. The device will take some cleaning when you’re done, and it’s not very versatile. But it was the best device our testers tried for wringing milk from raw almonds, cashews, or oats. It’s a bit spendy in general, but this is the best deal we’ve seen on it. —Matthew Korfhage As condiments go, Chengdu-based Fly By Jing is a luxury—a pricy and cheffy take on classic chili crisp that’ll add chili zip, fried-onion crunch; numbing Sichuan pepper; and wildly savory umami to pretty much anything from ice cream to noodles. (If you already know you’re a Fly By Jing fan, check out the brand’s advent calendar.) This is the best time to stock up or procure a gift for your favorite chilihead, with 20 percent or more off pretty much everything they make. Personally, I stick to the classic chili crisp, in the “big boi” size that comports with the volume of chili crisp I actually apply to my food. —Matthew Korfhage How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage It’s officially soup season, and what better way to get into the spirit than with the Philips Soup Maker (7/10, WIRED Review)? This bad boy can make so much soup. Also chilis, stews, purées, and smoothies. It’s kind of like an Instant Pot, if an Instant Pot was specifically for liquids. Choose your preferred texture, from chunky to creamy and more, and the machine will heat (or cool), blend, and stir the added ingredients to perfection. The machine is quiet and purpose-built. If you’re a soup enthusiast, or aspiring to be one, this deal is a goodie. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill This is our favorite budget pick, but we only recommend it if it’s on sale—so we don’t suggest waiting too long to snag it. It’s pretty basic compared to the other cordless stick vacs in Dyson’s lineup. Instead of a power button, it still comes with a trigger (so you’ll have to hold it down while vacuuming), and it comes with accessories like a Motorbar cleaner head, combination tool, and crevice tool. It’s unfortunately not compatible with the Laser Slim Fluffy Cleaner head (which shoots out a green laser to easily spot microscopic dust). It’s also not as powerful as the others, with a 120,000 RPM but it’s plenty for picking up dust and debris. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So After reviewing literally hundreds of products, the Petlibro Granary Smart Camera Feeder sticks out in my mind as one of my most beloved items I’ve ever tested. This reliable, tech-savvy, and highly customizable automatic feeder is the future helicopter pet parents want. The feeder is controlled via an app with a schedule you create, and the best part is that it has a camera so that you can watch and hear your pet eat even when far away—and you can communicate with them via speaker. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Full disclosure: it’s unclear if you can buy spare parts for the S1 Pro anymore. That said, I’ve used it several times this year to groom my pup and it’s miles better than the old hair trimmer I had. There are loads of accessories you can attach to the vacuum-like hose, and it sucks all the hair, fur, and nail clippings into the little donut-shaped canister. It’s so much less messy. Read our Best Dog Accessories guide for more information. —Julian Chokkattu Every year, I remember WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu’s rave about Rothy’s shoes and ask myself if this is the year that I allow myself to be persuaded. From now until December 3, all shoes on Rothy’s site are 30 percent off. All of its shoes are made from plastic bottles (the driving loafers are made up of 21 bottles). They’re washable and recyclable—when you’ve worn them through, send them back to the company, where they’re disassembled and given new life. —Adrienne So Smart plugs are pretty darn cool. Anything becomes a smart device with their help—just plug in and bam—you can remote control it. The Kasa Smart Plug Mini is one of our favorite smart plugs since it’s nice and small, making it easy to use without blocking a neighboring outlet. Use the app to make routines and scenes like you would smart lights, so that your house comes to life for you, or to act like you're home when you aren't. Buy one on sale, or score an entire four-pack on sale and deck out the house. —Nena Farrell The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell Automatic curtains are a great way to wake in the morning with natural light and to keep the heat in or out if you live somewhere sunny. The trouble is they tend to be horribly expensive, but you can get retrofit solutions, like this third-generation SwitchBot device. It is easy to fit and works well if you have the right kind of drapes. In fact, this is our pick of the best retrofit options for automatic curtains in our best smart shades guide. Just keep in mind that you need two for a pair of curtains. —Simon Hill The Hatch Restore 2 has been trending for a reason. It's both a sunrise alarm clock and a fantastic sound machine, and it's beautiful to look at to boot. I think it's better as a sound machine than it is a sunrise alarm—it’s recommended as such in our guide to the Best Sunrise Alarm Clocks—since it doesn't get quite as bright as our other picks to force you to rise or to double as a bedside lamp, but it does do a lovely range of colors and would still work in a very dark room. It's a great bedside gadget, and now it's on sale. —Nena Farrell The Hatch Rest has been in my son's room since the day we brought him home. In a sea of tricky baby setup items—strollers! Bassinets! Infant car seats!—the Hatch Rest was the easiest setup by far, and that was with an infant in our arms while we got it working. It connects quickly to the app via Bluetooth and bam, you can set up sounds and soft lights for your baby (and maybe yourself) to fall asleep to. It's handy for older kids to use too, with light cues that can tell them if it's time to get out of bed. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell Yogasleep's Dohm sound machine is one of the most reliable sound machines you can buy. It's been around since 1962 and has been a pick in our guide to the Best Sound Machines for a while, too. It has just one sound: a fan, made by the built-in rotating fan. It's a classic, reliable choice if you aren't looking for a specific sound, but just a gentle background noise to help you sleep at night. It's got a nice little discount right now for Cyber Monday. —Nena Farrell Clocky is a robotlike alarm clock on wheels that falls from whatever surface you put it on and rolls away so that you’re forced out of bed to turn it off. The alarm itself is pleasantly comical—catapulting itself off a surface while the wheels spin backward and forward to move around the room (with a lot of beeping and whirring action). While I never really had to go far to chase the alarm, Clocky was the most efficient at getting me up out of all of the wacky extreme alarms I tested. If you’re a perpetual snoozer like me and have wanted to test out a nontraditional alarm, it’s a good time to snag one at a discounted price. —Molly Higgins This Roxicosly Super Loud vibrating alarm clock is one of the most reviewed nontraditional alarm clocks on Amazon. It’s semi-customizable, as the buzzer goes up to 106 decibels with a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, with the escalating pattern of the buzzing easing the snoozer into wakefulness—and the alarm “off” button doesn’t stick out, which minimizes the temptation to just turn off the alarm. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than a traditional alarm clock would, and at $17, it’s nearly the lowest we’ve ever seen it. —Molly Higgins This is a great little lamp that can transform the vibe of a room. All you have to do is plug it in and aim it toward the wall. It produces a halo-like effect with rainbow colors that make the space feel nice and cozy. (For a sunrise, check out our guide to the Best Sunrise Alarm Clocks.) It comes with a short cord though, so you’ll have to plug it into a power strip if you want it in a specific spot. I’d also make sure not to place it anywhere that someone can accidentally knock it over. —Brenda Stolyar OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So This handy little sunrise lamp is a smaller version of the Lumie Luxe 750FM, my favorite sunrise alarm clock that doubles as a bedside lamp. While a little smaller, the Lumie Shine 300 still gets plenty bright to wake up to or to use as a general light source at your bedside. The Shine is stylish on a bedside table, too, with its fabric base and sleek set of buttons. The only downside is that it only tells military time. —Nena Farrell In an air purifier market that can quickly ascend near four figures, the Shark is a solid purifier with easy setup, low maintenance, odor-neutralizer technology, no need for filter changes, and the ability to operate very close to the wall. The 650-square-foot model makes a great gift for college kids living in small spaces, or those just starting out—especially at a Black Friday discount that’s near the best we’ve seen for the device. An also-discounted upgrade will purify the air for twice the square footage. —Matthew Korfhage I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapiro Bosch came out with its Air line of Energy Star- and CARB-certified air purifiers this summer, including small, medium, and large versions. Look for this large version (covers 2,745 square feet!) in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers. I’ve been using it on the main floor of my house that has 23-foot ceilings, and the difference in smells, dust, and overall air quality has been extremely noticeable. It’s also imperceptibly quiet with the fan running on the lowest speed. The only downside is the expensive filters that must be replaced every six to nine months. —Kat Merck Homedics’ 4-in-1 cylinder design and demure footprint is able to exchange the air in a 350 square foot room almost five times an hour, in step with the CDC's AHC recommendation.. It’s CARB-certified as an electronic filter combining HEPA and an activated carbon filter for odors and VOCs, plus UV-C technology to reduce bacteria, mold, and fungus. Its built-in sensor and indicator light adjust the fan setting while giving an illuminated visual cue for air quality. It also comes with Homedics’ unique feature of an essential oil tray. Unlike air fresheners, Homedics’ essential oil tray doesn’t impact indoor air quality. One caveat: Essential oils are not always pet-safe. And while it isn’t app-compatible, it has a three-year warranty and is less expensive than other models in its class. —Lisa Wood Shapiro Air quality is an invisible thing that can nonetheless have huge effects on how you feel. Might as well know how it’s going, right? The QP Pro Air Quality Monitor is less visual than some and the print’s a bit small, so it sits best on your desk or bedside table. But for that, there’s a lot of information: particulates, temp, CO2, humidity, volatile compounds, outdoor air quality index, hoo-boy. And even without a discount, the device is already low-priced amid its flashier competition. —Matthew Korfhage It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell Our colleagues in the UK got a Savile Row tailor to assess popular T-shirts and pronounced this the best for dad bods. You can stock up right now with this discount. —Martin Cizmar Nixplay is a classic in the digital photo frame world with a great screen and beautiful frame, but like many other digital photo frames we love, it's not a cheap investment. Except for right now, where you can get the touchscreen 10-inch Nixplay for the same price as cheap, crappy frames you'll find on Amazon. It's comparable to our favorite Aura frames, but for an extra-cheap price point right now. Plus, Nixplay plants a tree for every frame purchased. —Nena Farrell This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our best outdoor security camera guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3X zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8X hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built-in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 FPS frame rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. —Simon Hill This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill What makes this one of the best indoor security cameras you can buy is the face recognition. It can warn you when there’s a stranger in your home and tell you when your kids or partner get in. With HDR, the 1080p video quality is crystal clear at 30 fps, and there’s automatic night vision when it’s dark. You also get decent two-way audio and enforced two-factor authentication, which is important for an indoor camera. The big downside is that you need a Nest Aware subscription costing $8 per month ($80/year) for 30 days of event video history and familiar face alerts, but that covers all your Nest devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar Folks who receive loads of packages will appreciate Eufy’s dual camera doorbell because it provides a view of your porch floor and front step, alongside the usual picture of whoever is calling. This is the best subscription-free option in our best video doorbells guide because there’s 8 GB of built-in storage for local recording, and it can connect to a HomeBase 3 hub for more. The 2K footage is crisp and clear, and there’s on-device people, package, and even face detection, though it’s not always accurate, and this doorbell can be laggy when connecting away from home. —Simon Hill As one of the best sleep trackers, the Withings Sleep Analyzer tracks your movements, breathing, and heart rate throughout the night, sending data to the Withings Health Mate app. Each morning, you can review your sleep phases, broken into awake, REM, light, and deep sleep, and get a sleep score out of 100 based on duration, depth, regularity, interruptions, time to fall asleep, and time to get up. This mat slips under your mattress, making it a great sleep-tracking option for folks who don’t like to wear watches or rings in bed. —Simon Hill A security camera kit is an easy way to get started with home security, and this Eufy one includes two cameras with a home hub. The upgrade pick for folks seeking a local, subscription-free system in our best outdoor security cameras guide, the EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a lot going for it. Solar is built-in for battery top-ups, video resolution goes all the way up to 4K, and there's 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pet, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces, though it’s not as good at it as Google’s Nest cams. —Simon Hill There are so many good-quality, affordable security cameras on the market, and the Blink Mini 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorites. It can record 1080p footage at up to 30 fps, offers decent low-light performance, and boasts on-device person detection. The catch is the subscription at $3 per month or $30 per year for a single camera, but it nets you a generous 60-day unlimited cloud video history. This camera is ideal for sitting unobtrusively on a shelf and keeping an eye on your home when you are away.—Simon Hill These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Buffy made a name for itself with its eucalyptus-based sheets and bedding—all of which are fantastic!—but I'm most in love with the brand's first cotton product, a set of percale sheets. Buffy's percale uses Supima cotton, which is a longer-staple cotton, making it extra soft while still retaining the crisp, breathable style of percale sheets. It's one of my favorite cooling sheets, and now a go-to for me even as a past percale hater. If you've been shopping for new percale sheets, snag these while they're on sale. —Nena Farrell Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale has been live for the past week, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good Cyber Monday get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe At under 8 pounds, the tabletop Levoit air purifier is perfect for compact spaces. And while it’s advertised to clean a 1,095-square-foot space, that’s only one air exchange an hour. For context, the CDC’s recommendation is five air exchanges an hour, putting the ideal room size for the Levoit at around 200 square feet. At just over a foot tall, the Levoit has a prefilter, activated carbon, and HEPA. The CARB-certified Levoit even offers a line of custom filters to suit specific needs: toxin absorber filter, smoke remover, and pet allergens. It has a user-friendly control panel and isn’t app-compatible, but it does have a two-year warranty. It also hums along at a quiet 24 dB and comes in white, gray, and black. And while I usually recommend fitting rooms with air purifiers that can clean the room—that means at least four air exchanges an hour at its quietest setting—sometimes a petite purifier is what’s needed for a home office or nursery. —Lisa Wood Shapiro Most people don't like linen because of how rough it is. If that's what's kept you away, then it's time to shop our favorite linen for those who want something extra soft: Cultiver's linen sheets. It's the only set of sheets I'd describe as borderline silky, a term I usually save for the likes of bamboo and actual silk. They're warmer than other sets of linen, making these a good choice for the upcoming winter months. It's not cheap to score such soft linen, so don't miss the chance to get these unbelievably soft linen sheets for 25 percent off. You can get some colors like Dusk and Cedar for even cheaper (though the top sheets are sold out for both colors, but you can choose to forgo those and just get the fitted sheet and pillowcases). —Nena Farrell Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor. Check out our guide for more great gifts for travelers. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Branch’s Ergonomic Chair is my first recommendation for anyone who just wants to upgrade their crappy old seat without spending a fortune. It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane The Plum Paper A5 Planner is a gorgeous, customizable planner that lets you add themed pages to complement your life. Whether you want pages for meal planning, fitness tracking, or to journal your baby's growth, Plum Paper has it all. Those baby-related add-ons are why it’s my paper planner pick for parents. (It will cost you extra to add these things on, but it’s around $5-$10 per add-on.) Plum Paper also has a ton of gorgeous sticker packs to order, from seasonal to fitness or baby themes. You can get custom stickers, too, which is fun. It's a great planner if you want something truly specific to your life—my copy has a section just for my son!—and you can get your own for 30 percent off right now. —Nena Farrell We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount for Cyber Monday. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque Topping our best routers guide, this affordable router combines a slick design with reliable performance. It’s only a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) router, but should be fast enough for most folks and will cover an average-sized home with an internet connection of 1 Gbps or less. Ample connectivity includes four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. The setup is simple, TP-Link’s Tether app is easy to use, and basic security and features like QoS (Quality of Service) are included. —Simon Hill We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill This TP-Link mesh will cover your whole home on a limited budget (it’s the budget pick in our best mesh routers guide). It is a Wi-Fi 6 dual-band mesh (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) that’s easy to set up. It’s not the speediest mesh, but it is fast enough for folks with internet connections of 500 Mbps or less. The vaselike design blends in easily on shelves or tables, and each router sports two gigabit Ethernet ports. For more than basic security and parental controls, you need Security+ at $5 a month or $36 a year, and Advanced Parental Controls at $3 a month or $18 a year). But, even with the subscriptions, the X20 is an affordable way to get reliable Wi-Fi. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane Anyone looking for an upgraded power supply should take a gander at the Corsair RM1000x. This full-size PSU can support up to 1,000 watts at 80 plus gold efficiency, which should be more than enough for most systems. It’s fully modular, for ease of installation and upgrading, or just for adding your own custom cables, and sports a 135-mm magnetic fan with a zero RPM mode for almost silent running. It’s not the biggest discount in the world, but enough to make it worth it for system builders who have waited patiently for prices to drop. —Brad Bourque The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill Simple to set up and use, Amazon's Eero mesh systems are easy to recommend and can act as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. It’s a great choice for busy households with many devices and a 1 Gbps or faster connection. Performance is excellent, but the 6-GHz band is short-range. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year) but includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Folks with smaller homes and connections up to 500 Mbps, should consider the Eero 6 (3-Pack) on sale at $150 ($50 off), but the more heavily discounted Eero 6+ (3-Pack) at $195 ($105 off) is a better deal if you can afford it. —Simon Hill If you want the top-of-the-line mesh system from Amazon’s Eero, it’s the Max 7. This tri-band system supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard. Each router can cover up to 2,500 square feet, and they have four Ethernet ports apiece, two rated at 10 Gbps and two at 2.5 Gbps. You can mix and match Eero routers, the app is very accessible, and this system is designed to be hands-off. It also boasts comprehensive smart home connectivity and the optional Eero Plus subscription is pricey ($10 per month or $100 per year) but bundles parental controls, enhanced security, ad blocking, a password manager, and VPN service. Eero has worked out some of the kinks since I tested the Max 7 (7/10, WIRED Review), but it’s still likely overkill for most folks and more than you need to spend unless you have a big busy household with a multi-gig internet connection. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu I love reading with my Kindle in bed, but my wrists hate it thanks to my wrist cysts. Luckily there's a gadget to fix that for me: the Lamicall Tablet Holder, which works for most tablets, Kindles, and even a Nintendo Switch. I use this arm clip version to clip the stand onto my nightstand or my bed frame, but it also works great on side tables next to my couch or any other sturdy frame. —Nena Farrell The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque As the most secure pick in our best USB flash drives guide, the Kingston IronKey is packed with security features. Run Kingston’s software to set up a password or passphrase, use the virtual keyboard to guard against keyloggers, and rest assured the contents will be automatically erased after 10 wrong attempts. It is FIPS Certified 197 and has 256-bit AES-XTS encryption, offers protection against brute-force attacks and BadUSB, and is manufactured in the US so is TAA compliant. In other words, this drive is as secure as they come. —Simon Hill It may not be the easiest to assemble, but the EN1 from FlexiSpot offers everything you need from a motorized standing desk at a reasonable price (especially with the Black Friday discount). The single motor can go from a height of 28 to 48 inches, and it doesn't wobble too much when fully extended. The desktop is made from environmentally friendly chipboard, but doesn't feel too cheap. You can also save three presets for quick switching to your preferred heights. If you work from home, a standing desk can really help you avoid sitting all day. —Simon Hill Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Do you think of a laptop as metal framing around a web browser? Consider a Chromebook. Google rolled out a big upgrade called Chromebook Plus in 2023. The “Plus” stands for better performance—faster processors, more memory, more storage, and better video cameras. Our favorite of the models we've tried is Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's among the fastest Chromebooks we've tested for the money. It features a 3.75-GHz Intel Core i3-1315U CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of flash storage. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson The Swift Go offers outstanding performance for the price (7/10, WIRED Review). It also boasts an impressive 15-hour battery life. The downside is the speakers, which aren't great, and overall the body feels a little plasticky. But this is the least expensive Intel Core Ultra laptop we've tested by a few dollars, so if the budget is tight, the Swift Go is worth considering. —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson The ReMarkable 2 is a great digital notebook—so great that it’s No. 1 in our Best Digital Notebooks guide. I find myself grabbing it daily to write down all kinds of things—grocery lists! To-do lists! Ideas for novels I'll never write!—or upload PDFs for me to read and edit. It's pricey, though, making this Cyber Monday sale super exciting. This on-sale bundle includes the Marker Plus, which has an eraser on the end for you to easily edit your notes without needing to switch between your tools on the page. Choose a bundle with the folio of your choice—I love the Type Folio for taking more detailed notes or mixing up my writing screen of the day, but the Book Folio has a better price—to get the sale price. —Nena Farrell Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Ray (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the oddest little soundbar in the Sonos lineup, but at this price, it’s a slam dunk for the right buyer. Unlike its siblings and nearly all modern offerings on our best soundbars list, the Ray doesn’t offer HDMI connection, using optical input instead. That means it won’t automatically work with your TV remote and it doesn’t even come with one of its own. That said, it can be programmed to work with most modern remotes. Alternatively, you can control it via the Sonos app, which unlocks tons of other features like Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay 2, and the ability to link up with other Sonos speakers as part of a whole-home system. Those are features soundbars at this price level almost never include. But the Ray’s best feature is its excellent sound, pumping out clear, musical, and surprisingly meaty audio for a bar proportioned more like a Bluetooth speaker. –Ryan Waniata This is the Bar 1300X (8/10, WIRED Recommends) deal I’ve been waiting for. If you’ve been after transformative Atmos immersion in a large-and-in-charge soundbar system, your time is now. The 1300X’s standout feature is its removable, battery-powered surrounds that can detach from the main bar as surround speakers when needed, or reattach, charge, and play as part of the larger bar. They’ll even work as standalone Bluetooth speakers. It’s a cool feature, but the 1300X’s Dolby Atmos performance is even cooler. You’ll feel like you're there when the up-firing speakers get rolling, putting you in a dome of sound. Music also sounds great, and the included subwoofer provides power and poise for everything you play. The app is a little lackluster for sound adjustments, but otherwise, I’ve got nothing but kudos for this uniquely versatile setup. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) come with a bunch of useful features including Conversation Awareness (which lowers your music and background noise when you're having a conversation), Adaptive Transparency mode (that combines noise cancellation and transparency to adjust audio), and support for Find My in case you lose them. They also have above-average sound quality, with excellent noise cancellation, crisp highs, and authoritative bass. —Brenda Stolyar The wait for the AirPods Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) with USB-C is finally over. Aside from the updated charging port, these are identical to the Lightning version (also on sale)—complete with great noise cancellation, a massive soundstage, and rich bass. They also pack great build quality, with a mesh headband and fabric earcups. The USB-C version also comes in a few new colors, including starlight, orange, purple, blue, and midnight. —Brenda Stolyar If you have an iPhone, the workout buds you need are still the Beats Fit Pro. (If it’s not broke, why fix it?) These everyday buds fit remarkably well, even in my tiny ears, with flexible fins. The H1 chip pairs seamlessly with all Apple products, and they sound great! I have gone running and accidentally put my head under a faucet while wearing these and they still work great. For more Apple-specific picks, check out our guide to the Best AirPods. —Adrienne So Ever since it was bought by Apple, Beats has been churning out some of the world’s most underrated earbuds. The Studio Buds + are no exception, with noise canceling, excellent integration with iPhones, and a more comfortable fit than you’ll get from AirPods Pro. They’re also better for workouts, thanks to built-in earfins that keep the IPX4-rated headphones in your ears. —Parker Hall After taking the Soundcore Life Q30 on a six-hour flight, I was perfectly pleased with the noise canceling they provide at a fraction of what you’ll pay for the best noise cancelers. They’re not going to give you the stunning tranquility of top names like Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, but they get the job done. Sound is warm yet detailed, and easy to adjust in the app, features are aplenty, and 40 hours of battery life per charge keeps away outlet apprehension. There are few telltale signs these aren’t premium cans in the build, including rather touchy plastic shells that tend to scratch easily. An included case helps there–and at this price, you can afford to treat them tough. —Ryan Waniata It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata I’m a big fan of Stax electrostatic headphones. These Bluetooth headphones are not that, but they retain some of the heritage, have solid sound, and offer all the audiophile specs you want. —Martin Cizmar Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20 this Cyber Monday. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These classic wired headphones have been in style since the moment they came out decades ago. The cool metal headband meets molded plastic earcups with vintage-style foam ear coverings, making these the best headphones ever to play with your CD or cassette player. —Parker Hall These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall Hearing damage is no joke, and it’s permanent. I’ve loved carrying these cheap earplugs from Earpeace on my keychain for when things get too loud, whether at a concert or elsewhere. They’re cheap, and they really do better with wide frequency ranges than the foam earplugs you’re probably most used to. If you always find yourself wishing you brought a pair, now is a good time to snag them. —Parker Hall These earplugs are a festival essential, and they’re always in my purse just in case I spontaneously decide to go to a show. I used to hate wearing earplugs (and I have the hearing damage to prove it). These have soft silicone outer shells that are barely noticeable, with pull tabs for easy adjustment and removal. The real magic is in the itty-bitty attenuator, which filters out the most damaging sounds on the high and low end of the spectrum without muffling the music. Even when the bass is rattling my bones for hours, I can wake up the next day without ringing ears. The included metal keychain case is convenient, too. —Louryn Strampe I prefer the Earpeace model above, but if you want to buy a couple of pairs of cheap earplugs to keep in your arsenal, Vibes makes a solid product too. I like how sleek they are in your ears; you don’t look like you’re wearing earplugs in front of the cool kids. The downside is that these can be a bit easier to lose—and harder to pull out—than other pairs. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe The Beats Studio Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) were solid headphones at full price, but after dropping a full $100 to around $250 on average, they became a lot more appealing. Now they’ve slipped even further, moving closer to the “gotta grab” category thanks to a mix of engaging sound and impressive usability. Extras include solid noise canceling, brilliant transparency mode, Apple-centric extras like “Hey, Siri” voice commands, and one-touch pairing for iPhone or Android devices. Their build isn’t as posh as premium models from Sony or Bose, but at a fraction of the price, they’re the better buy for tighter budgets. —Ryan Waniata Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata Soundcore’s Space A40 earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are getting older and probably not wiser, but they’re still a great pair of buds at bargain basement pricing. They offer decent noise canceling and transparency mode, lively sound with impressive stereo spacing, and a stylish design that makes them look a lot more pricey than they cost. You’ll find a fit that’s comfy enough for long listening sessions and plenty of the spoils in flagship buds at a fraction of the cost. Their one glaring omission is auto-pause sensors, and their touch sensors aren’t the most responsive, either. Those points aside, these buds are easy to love and even easier on your wallet. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Now is the time to procure the best face computer. The Ray-Ban Meta sunglasses are on sale across Meta, Ray-Ban, Best Buy, Target, and Amazon through December 2. I freaking love these things (possibly because I’ve been wearing Ray-Ban Wayfarers for almost two decades) and they’re so useful. You can listen to podcasts on your run! You can take pictures to text to your spouse! You can check if the food cart is open, all without taking out your phone. And as if that weren’t enough, they also shade your eyes. —Adrienne So Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Tribit’s Stormbox 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) was always on sale, even at full price. It costs as little as half what you’ll pay for rivals like the Ultimate Ears Boom 4, and at times comes surprisingly close in performance. Its tubular design puts out clear mids and solid bass from onboard passive radiators, while extras include up to 24 hours of battery life, long-range Bluetooth connection, a fully equipped app, and even a 3.5 mm analog input. You can get better sound by spending up, but this is among the best Bluetooth speakers you’ll find for the money. —Ryan Waniata Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata The Roam’s second coming includes a crucial update in the form of a simplified Bluetooth key, making it much easier to take the speaker off your local network and into the wild. This makes the Roam 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) an even better version of what is arguably the most versatile wireless speaker you can buy. Pack it in your bag, set it on the mantle, or drop it in the pool–the Roam abides (just don’t leave it in the pool). As with all things Sonos, the Roam’s wide array of streaming options and fantastic sound are its primary assets, while its utter packability makes it much more travel-friendly than Sonos’ other Bluetooth speaker, the Move. It all adds up to a killer sonic companion, wherever you may … well, you get it. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated this Cyber Monday. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Everyone needs a good pair of computer speakers, especially if you work from a home office. These desktop speakers from Audioengine have wired and Bluetooth connectivity, and they have front ports for better bass when placed against a wall or on a desktop. They’re not the newest model ever, but they’re still our favorite. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy, and the Everboom (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) is another solid option with a slightly inflated price. This sale brings it in line with more competitors. The Everboom has a few upgrades over siblings like the Megaboom 4, including slightly louder peak volume and extra bass, making it a mildly better choice for letting things fly at outdoor gatherings. It offers similar features elsewhere, including the ability to connect with up to 150 other UE speakers, a customizable EQ, and even a megaphone feature that lets you call through the speaker from the app. It's rugged, it’s weatherproof, and on sale, it’s a solid deal that’s worth adding to your arsenal. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata Sonos’ new app has made headlines for its troubles, but I’ve had the Era 300 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) on my network since it launched and never had an issue with it. The company seems to have mostly shored up its app issues elsewhere, letting the Era 300’s sound performance shine as it should. This Dolby Atmos-ready speaker can create a big and spacey soundstage with 3D audio tracks, and sounds fantastic with stereo music too, providing clear and intimate detail with deep bass. The speaker is loaded with features, including voice control via Alexa and Sonos’ built-in system, tons of streaming options, and the ability to connect with other Sonos speakers in a whole-home or surround sound configuration. That’s a lot of good stuff at an equally good sale price. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata The Era 100 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) was part of a full acoustic overhaul for Sonos’ smart speakers, and while the brand has had some trouble with its app of late, the Era 100’s performance has never been in doubt. This is simply the best-sounding smart speaker in its class, providing smooth and detailed mids, glistening treble, and much more bass than you’d expect from its tubular frame. It connects to your network in multiple configurations, working well as part of a multi-room audio system or a satellite for one of Sonos’ top-rated soundbars like the new Arc Ultra. Smarts are provided by both Alexa and Sonos’ built-in voice control system. The brand’s app revamp seems to have stabilized, and regardless, I’ve been using the Era 100 trouble-free since it launched in 2023. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar The Toniebox is the best kids speaker for younger kids. It’s a durable, squishy cube you can leave with your children unattended. When your kid places different “Tonies” on top of the cube, it plays songs and stories connected to the Tonies. It’s Wi-Fi-connected and you can also have grandparents or other family members record up to 90 minutes of reading to the kids or other audio messages. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale for Cyber Monday, but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage For the Aeropress lover in your life, even if it’s you: Swap out the cap on your Aeropress for a thicker Prismo, and you'll drastically increase the pressure you exert on the resulting brew. During testing, the WIRED team found this offered a cleaner cup, a bit of aeration, and an even more satisfying cold brew. Science! Though this Cyber Monday deal isn’t a whopper, it still matches the best discount we’ve seen this year. —Matthew Korfhage Here’s a gift for the premium coffee lover in your life: A vacuum container big enough for a coffee bag that’ll preserve flavor on fancy beans a lot longer. Just drop in the bag of coffee, then twist the handle on the pump to remove all air. The beans will await, perfectly in stasis. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage The Tally (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a scale for true coffee nerds. Sure, it weighs your coffee. It’ll also set a timer to track weight during a pour-over, for the true beanheads. Even more fun, the “Brew assist” mode will let you enter your desired coffee-to-water ratios and simul-calculate how much water you’ll need for the perfect brew as you weigh out your beans. Is this all a bit much? Sure—unless you’re a total nerd. Y’all know who you are. WIRED contributor Joe Ray loved the scale’s intuitive design. Like most Fellow coffee gear during Cyber Monday, the Tally is 20 percent off right now. —Matthew Korfhage The Secura French press is stainless steel, sturdy, and well-insulated. This last quality is what’s made it the WIRED Gear team’s favorite French press to make cold brew. But keeping hot coffee hot is also an excellent idea, and it’ll do that, too. —Matthew Korfhage This is the Wired Gear team’s favorite overall coffee bean grinder (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The Opus is a quiet device and offers a beautifully consistent grind all the way down to fine espresso settings. It also doesn’t break the bank compared to the highest-end grinders, which is even truer while it’s on sale. —Matthew Korfhage Need your espresso fix at the office, or a hotel room? This is the device we’d take. It’s the overall best portable espresso maker that the WIRED Gear team has tested: compact, lightweight and solid, with excellent extraction and surprisingly good crema. Just know you’ll have to apply some force on very fine grinds, a consideration for those with joint pain in their hands. —Matthew Korfhage Want better coffee? Get better coffee. The best way to upgrade your coffee is to make sure you're using fresh beans, and a coffee subscription service is the most reliable way to get a fresh bag at your doorstep. Atlas is our favorite single-origin roaster (for more on what that means, see our Best Coffee Subscriptions guide) and this deal gets your first bag of fresh beans delivered for free. —Scott Gilbertson Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s very easy to see why the Kindle Paperwhite is Amazon’s most popular model. The 12th-generation model (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a larger display (7 inches instead of 6.8), the highest contrast ratio on any Kindle (for sharp text and images), and three months of battery life (an increase from two months on its predecessor). It’s also the thinnest yet. We recommend it to anyone who is buying their very first Kindle. The Signature Edition is also on sale for $155, which comes with double the storage, auto-adjust brightness, and support for wireless charger. —Brenda Stolyar Even without the discount, the basic Kindle was already the most affordable option. And now, it’s under $100. The latest version is an iterative update compared to the 2022 model but it does come with a higher contrast ratio, a 25-percent-brighter front light at the highest setting, and a faster page-turn rate. It’s also the smallest Kindle, making it easy to hold one-handed and to travel with. It comes in a super fun matcha color, too. —Brenda Stolyar The latest kid-friendly Kindles received the same treatment as the rest of Amazon’s lineup—with a faster page-turn rate, a brighter screen, and a higher contrast ratio. This discount is for the basic model, which is small and compact. It also comes with a variety of kid-friendly covers to choose from. But the Paperwhite Kids is also on sale for $140 ($40 off). It comes with a larger display that’s better for reading graphic novels. Plus, it’s waterproof so you won’t have to worry about those accidental spills as much. Both models also come with six months of access to Kids+, Amazon’s subscription service for age-appropriate books, and a two-year warranty. —Brenda Stolyar We think Amazon’s Audible Premium Plus is the best audiobook service, as it bundles a library of Audible Originals, audiobooks, and podcasts, with one credit per month to use on any audiobook title you fancy, and regular exclusive deals and discounts. Usually, you get one month free, after which it costs $15 per month, but any nonsubscriber can get three months for $1 until the end of the year. Remember that you get to keep titles purchased with credits, even after your subscription ends. —Simon Hill Somehow it’s 2024 and most Kindles don’t have page-turning buttons. Forge your own future with this inexpensive little accessory. It comes with two pieces—one that you’ll attach to your Kindle, and one that you’ll hold in your hand. Simply click the button and your page will turn. The device is available in three different colors—black, pink, and white. You can also use it on your iPad or other device to turn pages on the Kindle app. Pair it with a gooseneck holder for the ultimate cozy reading sessions this winter. —Louryn Strampe Fire Tablets aren't great, but then again they're only $75 on sale—what do you want for that price? If all you plan to do is watch Amazon content and do basic tasks like email and browsing the web, they are reasonably capable and certainly affordable. The Fire HD 10 is our favorite of the bunch, with a 1080p screen and 3 gigabytes of RAM so it can handle watching videos and browsing with quite a few tabs open. —Scott Gilbertson The Fire HD 10 Kid's Edition is exactly the same as the regular above, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon's tablets are limited but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). —Scott Gilbertson The best value in the Fire tablet lineup, the HD 8 was updated earlier this year with more RAM (3GB) and a better 5-megapixel camera. It retains the same form factor, and battery life is still rated at 13 hours, although we rarely got over 11 in our testing. Storage options are either 32 GB or 64 GB, but I'd say stick with the cheaper of the two and add a microSD card (up to 1 TB, we like this Samsung card, also on sale for $27). —Scott Gilbertson The Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) is the most powerful tablet in the Fire lineup, almost like Amazon decided to make a real tablet. The problem is, despite being speedy and capable on the hardware side, it's still crippled by Amazon's subpar Fire OS. At full price we don't recommend this one, however, now that it's down to $140, it's a good deal. It's capable, much sleeker than the rest of the Fire tablets, and if you want to be more productive with it, the bundle with a keyboard is also on sale for $225 ($125 off). —Scott Gilbertson The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but it's on major sale for Cyber Monday. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20 this Cyber Monday. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Perhaps the best 4K streamer for folks who watch loads of Amazon Prime shows and movies, this Fire Stick is easy to set up and use, supports Wi-Fi 6E for fast and stable streaming, and packs 16 gigabytes of storage. Alexa is built into the remote to help you find content or ask questions about what you’re watching. The picture-in-picture mode is handy for showing security cameras or controlling other smart home devices. There's also “Ambient Experience,” which cycles through art or nature scenes on your TV when you’re not watching something. —Simon Hill Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The NuDerma Therapy Wand, now $59, is an affordable way to elevate your skincare routine for about less than half the cost of a single facial. Its neon-powered applicators stimulate circulation and oxygenate your skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and hydrated. Use it after applying your serums and creams to enhance their potency. —Boutayna Chokrane The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off for Cyber Monday, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Our favorite cheap electric toothbrush is even cheaper for Cyber Monday. You can usually find it for around $20, but it’s just $15 right now. It does a great job cleaning, has a gentle sonic cleaning style, and even comes with seven (that’s right, seven!) replacement heads. That’s not even $2 for the toothbrush and each head. It comes in pink, too. The only downside is that the charger is inconvenient, but for how much you get for the low price, it’s worth it. —Nena Farrell Yes, the TheraFace Mask is one of the pricier LED masks on the market, so if there’s ever a time to indulge, it’s during a sale. What sets it apart from other LED masks is the added vibration therapy, which massages pressure points around the eyes, browline, and scalp. Using it feels less like skincare and more like a therapeutic retreat I can experience from the comfort of my bed. —Boutayna Chokrane Why choose between skincare tools when you can have them all? With six interchangeable heads, the FDA-cleared TheraFace Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) offers an impressive range of facial treatments: cleansing, microcurrent, percussive massage, and LED light therapy (blue, red, and infrared). You don’t need to spend $400 for clear skin, but with $100 off, it’s a tempting treat for any beauty enthusiasts looking to pamper themselves at home. —Boutayna Chokrane The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage There are hair straighteners that are best for thick and curly hair and hair straighteners that are best for finer, more wavy hair, but it’s rare to find one that works great for both. As the top pick in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this ceramic iron makes short work of most hair textures—former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has one she’s been using on her curls since college, and this is the iron I use on my own unruly 3a curls for daily touch-ups. I also like the maneuverability of the smaller plates and the quick one-minute heating time. —Kat Merck This is not the exact model of hair straightener former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano tested in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, but it is a more affordable version of the Prima3100, and many hair professionals swear by BaByliss as a brand. I myself have had a BaByliss Pro hair dryer for more than 10 years and it still works as well as the day I bought it. I also love titanium-plate hair straighteners for their higher temperature maximums (450 degrees Fahrenheit) and even heat distribution, so I wouldn’t hesitate to give this one a try while it’s 20 bucks off. —Kat Merck If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck This is the best curling iron for long hair. It’s suitable for all hair types and has a tourmaline ceramic-coated barrel that’ll help your hair stay silky and frizz-free. The curling iron heats up quickly, and the long barrel means you have plenty of room to work so you won’t have to contort around trying to perfect your styling technique. This model also has dual voltage, so it’ll work on any international trips. —Louryn Strampe Deemed the best curling iron for long-lasting curls in our guide to the Best Curling Irons, WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary loved the elongated barrel of this iron, as well as the metal clamp to hold a curl in place while it sets. GHD is a quality brand that also makes some of our favorite hair straighteners as well, like the Chronos and Platinum+. Kilkeary wasn’t a huge fan of the lack of temperature dial on this curling iron, but she still recommends it as a durable option that produces long-lasting results. —Kat Merck Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano declared this uniquely shaped hair dryer as “made for curls” in our guide to the Best Hair Dryers. Basically a diffuser and dryer in one, it’s designed to dry curls gently while cutting down on frizz and puffiness. It doesn’t have a traditional handle, but that didn’t bother Medea. If you’re short on space in your bathroom and don’t want to have to store a hair dryer and separate diffuser attachment, this could be the solution for you. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe The MakeUp Eraser is a thing of beauty. The soft microfiber cloth is one of our favorite reusable products. It lives up to its name—simply get it wet with warm water and rub it gently over your face. It’ll demolish your makeup while being kinder to your skin than disposable makeup wipes. I’ve successfully used it to remove smoky eye looks, red liquid lipstick, and heavy contour—all in one fell swoop. You’ll still want to cleanse with a traditional cleanser or some micellar water, especially to remove traces from harder-to-reach areas like your inner corner or lashline, but this is an excellent and economical way to wash your face. The cloth is machine-washable and dries pretty quickly as well. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck A handle-free hair dryer may seem like a strange choice, but former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano thought this unique tool was not only comfortable to use, but made a great travel dryer due to its portability. Many online reviews mention that this is the dryer their hairdresser uses, which is not surprising given that Paul Mitchell also makes our favorite hair straightener. At this price, this would make a great gift for someone looking for a unique hair dryer that’s easy to store and pack. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's Cyber Monday sale. —Nena Farrell If you’re like me and spend endless hours glued to screens, you’re all too familiar with the toll it takes—eye strain, throbbing headaches, mental fatigue … SmartGoggles uses gentle heat, vibrations, and air compression to relieve the tension in your eyes and temples after a long day. Therabody recently released the 2.0, but the original model is equally impressive (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Our only gripe with the SmartGoggles is the price—until now. —Boutayna Chokrane With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage We only recommend three smart scales, and this is one of ’em. The Bluetooth scale displays weight on the LED screen, but if you want access to its other metrics—like muscle mass, visceral fat, and BMR measurements—you’ll need to use the Wyze smartphone app. Because of course, you will. But the scale can be used with up to eight individuals and there are modes for babies, pets, and luggage as well. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite Android phone is back at its lowest price!

Read our Best Pixel Phones guide to see all the fun little software tricks to take advantage of. —Julian Chokkattu This is the first major discount on Google’s brand-new Pixel smartphones, launched in late August (9/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re some of the smartest smartphones, with plenty of new features powered by Google’s Gemini large language models. For example, you can get instant transcriptions and summaries from voice recordings or phone calls. The XL version has the same features with a bigger display (and a bigger battery too). It costs $849 ($250 off). —Julian Chokkattu There are some quirks, but the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (6/10, WIRED Recommends) is the booklike folding phone I’d buy if I were in the market, and this is a tantalizing price. It’s very slim and using the external display feels like a normal phone, with nearly the same dimensions as the Pixel 9 Pro. But, of course, you can open the Fold up to reveal a much larger 8-inch internal screen, perfect for catching up on shows on the commute home. —Julian Chokkattu OK, brace yourselves, because the Galaxy S24 lineup now has four phones: Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the new Galaxy S24 FE (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The latter is the cheapest, taking some of the highlights from the flagship lineup and putting it in a more affordable body, lowering the price. At $475, it’s a great smartphone with long software support (seven years), even if it’s a bit drab. The S24 and S24+ won’t feel dramatically different, offering boosted specs here and there, but it’s the S24 Ultra for $950 ($350 off) you should consider if you’re after Samsung’s best. This one has the S Pen stylus built in, not to mention the 5X optical zoom, and the titanium build. Just know that Samsung is expected to debut a successor in January, so wait if you want the latest and greatest. This deal is also at Samsung and Best Buy. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu This 10-foot cable is long enough to allow you to place your phone where you want while charging (or continue using it without having to crouch near the outlet). It’s a durable braided nylon cable from Anker that comes with a lifetime warranty. It can deliver up to 100 watts to fast-charge any phone or tablet and comes with a handy cable tie. You can get it in black or white, but I like the red because it stands out, making it less of a tripping hazard. This is the best long cable in our best USB-C cables guide. —Simon Hill This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu OtterBox is usually my “Most Protective” recommendation in our many smartphone case guides. But the company makes all sorts of cases, even ones that are colorful, stylish, and slim. If you’re in the market for a new case, the company is offering 30 percent off sitewide on Amazon as well as its website. If you need a place to start, here are a few picks: Own a Pixel 9 series phone? I like the Commuter Series for $25 ($15 off). iPhone 16 owners should check out the protective OtterBox Defender Series Pro XT for $49 ($21 off). Anyone with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series should try the Commuter Series for $28 ($12 off). —Julian Chokkattu We like a variety of Case-Mate's phone cases and accessories. There's the Soap Bubble Magnetic Wallet, which is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MagSafe Wallets—it's secure, fits more than three cards (unlike most MagSafe wallets), and has a super cute aesthetic. We also like the glittery Karat Granite MagSafe Case for the iPhone 16, which adds a fun touch to this year's vibrant iPhone color options. —Brenda Stolyar If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The newest Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in two sizes, and I very much recommend you snag the larger 45-mm variant. It doesn’t look that big on small wrists, but you get much better battery life (just a smidge over a full 24 hours). Google’s health and fitness tracking capabilities are excellent, and there’s even a unique Loss of Pulse feature on the way in the US (it’s available in select countries), which could help contact emergency services in the event of cardiac arrest. —Julian Chokkattu The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The Withings’ line is consistently our top analog pick for both Best Smartwatches and Best Fitness Trackers. My colleague Simon Hill tested it and found that it’s comfortable, looks great, and has a long battery life and a comprehensive suite of health features that track heart rate and monitor your ECG. Two minor dings—Simon was unimpressed by the optional new subscription, and I found that the cycle tracking feature that comes with temperature tracking was not able to predict my period, but then again, no wrist-based wearable really can (so far). —Adrienne So Even though this deal isn’t shocking, I think more people should know about this amazingly cheap smartwatch (and it is a bit cheaper). CMF is the sub-brand of Nothing, which makes really affordable, retro-inspired gear that also has shockingly good value. This is the very rare, attractive sub-$100 smartwatch that also has accurate heart rate tracking and sleep. It has its own proprietary OS but works with iOS and Android. It also has a 10-day battery life and a very pretty AMOLED screen. —Adrienne So The Amazfit Balance (5/10, WIRED Recommends) is a decent smartwatch. Its sharp display, solid battery life, and fitness tracking is commendable at this price. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So says its AI-powered features don’t add much value, and the $15-per-month subscription can get taxing. Still, it’s a sleek watch with the basics covered, and the $60 discount makes it easier to forgive its flaws. —Boutayna Chokrane The Shock Clock 3 asks the question: What if a Fitbit was evil? This wearable wrist alarm I tested for my extreme alarm clocks guide vibrates, beeps, and zaps, with multiple strength settings and intervals to wake the snoozer. You can also opt for a silent alarm that wakes through touch, which is good for hard-of-hearing people or couples sharing a bed with different wakeup times. Be aware, though, the zaps at full strength can be quite painful and feel like a mild electric shock. If lowkey torture wasn’t enough, there are also advanced alarm options, like jumping jacks, so that you’re physically forced out of bed. This wearable alarm is good for chronic snoozers or those with partners, and the discounted price is a little closer to the actual value of this sometimes-glitchy device. —Molly Higgins Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a Cyber Monday deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100 for Cyber Monday, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse, or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale for Cyber Monday and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill If you’re hunting for an upgraded gaming headset with all the bells and whistles, the Arctis Nova Pro is our favorite pick for serious gamers. It includes a desktop DAC with convenient volume controls, real-time information, and EQ settings. Plus, it’s super comfortable for gaming long hours, with soft ear cups and an extra stretchy headband support that reduces strain on the top of your head. The wired version is on discount, but there’s a Wireless version as well (8/10, WIRED Recommends) if that’s more your speed. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount for Cyber Monday, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson The Backbone One (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the few products I’ve tried for work that I still reach for frequently, despite first reviewing it in 2020. In fact, I like this little mobile gaming controller so much that when I misplaced the review unit, I personally purchased my own. It’s compatible with iPhone and Android phones—just make sure to pick the right adapter when checking out. Plug it into your phone, stretch the controller over the back of your device, and prepare to be immersed. The buttons are tactile and have a superfast response time, and there’s a companion app that makes it easy to find new controller-supported mobile games, record your highlights, stream, and more. It also has pass-through charging and a headphone jack. My only gripe is that it’s a little awkward to tote around. —Louryn Strampe This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson If you’re building a new computer, you could do a lot worse than the Asus ROG Strix B550-F for your motherboard. This Ryzen-supporting motherboard is well-priced for its feature set, which is basic but sufficient. It only has PCIe 4.0 and DDR4 RAM, which means parts will be a bit cheaper and easier to come by, and 2.5 Gbps ethernet and USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports mean you still have modern connectivity. It’s not the biggest discount in the world, but every dollar counts when you’re building a new PC. —Brad Bourque Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through Cyber Monday (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger this Cyber Monday. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar After the holiday, reviewer Scott Gilbertson will be penning his ode to waxed canvas, the O.G. weatherproof material. In the meantime, we have his pick for the manliest jacket, which is the waxed canvas trucker you can see on Pedro Pascal in The Last of Us. It is the only jacket that will repel zombie blood from your flannel or hoodie, as you fight to save the ones you love.—Adrienne So Almost everything at Ooni is 20 percent off for Cyber Monday. While the Solo Stove may be the top pick in our Best Pizza Ovens roundup (temporarily! We don’t know for sure yet), we’ve tried and recommend pretty much everything from Ooni, which basically invented the category when the company launched in 2012. The Volt is its electric oven, which is the best pick if you’re staying inside right now. The specs are better than its closest competitor, the Breville Pizzaiolo, and I’ve made everything from cookies to roasted broccoli in mine. —Adrienne So I’ve put about 150 miles on this double-battery ebike, most of it full-throttle without pedaling. No, I didn’t do that all in one charge—the advertised 211 miles would be for a much lighter man pedaling much harder on a smoother surface than crushed limestone—but this bike handled well throughout. (After having it professionally tuned, that is—I’ve assembled and tested a half-dozen cheap ebikes and this one required the most attention from a professional bike mechanic out of the box.) For the Black Friday price of $1,250 you get a burly cargo bike with two big batteries and fast-charging if you’re looking to haul kids and groceries for long distances without dropping big bucks for one of our top electric cargo bike picks. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Ben Johns is the closest thing pickleball has to a household name, and his signature paddle from Joola is our pick for power players. This paddle has lots of pop if you’re looking to really launch ‘em. —Martin Cizmar This is WIRED editor Adrienne So's favorite running rain jacket. Even though it has a 10.2K waterproof rating, the fabric is still stretchy, soft, and breathable, while the cut is trim and tidy. WIRED editor Adrienne So says she wore it for several hours while running in the rain and water continued to bead up on the service without getting uncomfortably clammy underneath. If you get hot, you can open the mesh pockets to vent it. We also like that it comes in bright colors (for high visibility) and has reflective detailing. If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane I’m currently testing the Hikerkind Midlayer for our Gifts for Cold People guide. Hikerkind is designed for outdoorswomen who want technical clothing that fits correctly (sign me up!). The Midlayer doesn’t look overtly technical, but it uses the same recycled, synthetic Polartec Power Air as other high-end insulating midlayers. Honestly, it doesn’t keep me as warm as merino wool, but for highly aerobic activities, it’s drier (and prettier). —Adrienne So The top pick on our brand-new guide to the best flashlights, the Arkfeld Pro has a bright, 1300-lumen main beam but won us over with its two auxiliary lights, a laser for spotlighting stuff across distances, and a UV light that’s helpful in identifying leaks and stains. It’s rechargeable via a handy magnetic connection and the square shape keeps it from rolling weird places. —Martin Cizmar Not only is the Theragun Sense the quietest of all Theraguns, but it also packs the same premium features as the higher-end models. The built-in LCD screen and guided breathwork routines deliver the same luxe factor as the Pro Plus model for $400 less. The four included attachments (standard ball, dampener, thumb, and micro-point) cover all the muscle groups. —Boutayna Chokrane Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off) for Cyber Monday, it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re new to Theraguns or just need a straightforward recovery tool without blowing your whole paycheck, the Theragun Relief is an absolute steal—especially at $30 off. As the most affordable one, it omits the flashy features of the higher-end models, but it doesn’t skimp on performance. With three speed settings and three attachments (standard ball, dampener, and thumb), it still delivers everything one might need for muscle relief. —Boutayna Chokrane Don’t let the size of the Theragun Mini 2 fool you—though she be but little, she is fierce! With three attachments (standard ball, dampener, and thumb) and 150-minute battery life, the Mini 2 is the best for targeting sore spots on the go. It’s not the best for the harder-to-reach areas, but it excels in portability. I’ve been carrying it in my gym bag for months and hardly notice its presence. It even includes a zip-up case; one less pochette to buy. —Boutayna Chokrane You can buy standard foam rollers for way less, but the Therabody Wave Roller justifies its price with its tech-enhanced features. With five vibration frequencies, it allows you to target specific muscle groups with varying intensities. The added benefit of Bluetooth connectivity lets you pair it with the Therabody app for even more customized options. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The KQi3 Pro used to be my top recommendation, but it’s not the newest kid on the block and has been supplanted by the Niu KQi 300X (see below). I regularly managed around 15 miles of range at its 20-mph top speed. It’s 45 pounds, but because the stem is thin and latches into the deck, it’s not too hard to carry. This is a scooter you can use for short commutes in a city, even if it’s a couple of years old. The price has been creeping lower for the past two years but this is the lowest to date. You should also check out the KQi3 Max, which bumps the motor slightly for a smidge more power when climbing hills. It’s on sale for $599 ($150 off). —Julian Chokkattu Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So I’ve been testing this down puffer instead of my usual Patagonia puffer so far this winter and have been duly impressed by the perfect trim cuts of the recycled shell fabric, smooth zippers, and how light it is (less than a pound for my XL). —Martin Cizmar WIRED contributor Kristin Canning said that this was the best bug spray, so imagine my triumph when I looked it up on Amazon and saw that this is the bug spray I’ve already bought! I agree with Kristin’s assessment that the spray feels lightweight and the smell isn’t off-putting. This is a good time to stock up if you’re already planning your sunny holiday vacation. —Adrienne So I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell If you’re tired of getting on a ladder to put up your Christmas lights each year, try Govee’s Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro instead. They’re a set of permanent lights, designed to stay up all year and for years to come. These smart lights can handle a nice range of temperatures (from -4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and are weatherproof with an IP67 rating for the lights and an IP65 rating for the control box. WIRED reviewer Simon Hill says the adhesive works well to attach them to your home, and that installation for these permanent lights was easy overall. You can easily customize the lights for the holidays and months beyond using the Govee app to create almost any kind of color design or find any lighting effect you could hope for. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So As WIRED contributor Kristin Canning said, this treadmill has everything. It’s durable, well-built, and has a very decent top speed of 12 mph (that’s a 5-minute mile pace). It also has iFit, which is NordicTrack’s library of up to 10,000 workouts where you follow a trainer through gorgeous landscapes and have the treadmill automatically adjust your speed and incline. If it’s just too nasty to run outside right now, this is a great time to buy. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Bubble umbrellas are fun. They envelop your head and torso so there’s less rain slapping your face, and this one from ShedRain is see-through (and in our Best Umbrellas guide!). ShedRain is discounting everything by 30 percent, though some items are only available on its website and not on Amazon. That includes two I recently tested and like: The Duo, which makes it easier for a tall and short person to share the same umbrella, and the Vortex V2, a solid compact umbrella. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane The WIRED furbabies have spoken, and they approve of the Dagne Dover Kyoto Pet Carrier. Editor Julian Chokkattu’s pup, Tobu, loves the soft-sided carrier for beach trips. Editor Kat Merck’s cat, Scylla, has claimed it as her napping pod. No surprise there considering kitties adore the sherpa bed; the fact that it’s removable and washable is a win for pet parents. Other features worth noting: It’s TSA-compliant, includes seatbelt loops for car rides, and it’s collapsible for easy storage. —Boutayna Chokrane This is my absolute favorite bag in the entire world—no, I'm not exaggerating. It's easy to see why it went viral on TikTok. Not only does it fit a ton of stuff (I've managed to cram everything from multiple cartons of ice cream to a Surface Laptop Go 3 without overstuffing it) but it also has an adjustable shoulder strap (you can wear it as a crossbody or on your shoulder), and it's available in a bunch of fun colors and designs like Hello Kitty, stars, and more. Baggu also offers a larger version, which is also on sale for $50 ($12 off). —Brenda Stolyar If you’re a “quiet luxury” kind of person, Cuyana is holding a big Cyber Monday sale that includes one of our favorite tote bags and the travel beauty case. The best part about the System Tote—which gets its name from all the different add-ons that you can buy to customize your carrying needs—is that the handles are integrated with the leather, so there’s no possible failure points where the stitching can come undone. Editor Kat Merck also dropped the toiletry case onto hard tile from 5 feet up and didn’t damage any of her cosmetics. —Adrienne So No, a basic Travelpro soft-sided carry-on isn’t going to be the flashiest personal accompaniment when you’re going through the airport. But there’s a reason this is the brand most flight attendants have—you get a tremendous amount of bang for your buck. Our tester found that the handle was sturdy, the wheels rolled smoothly, and it weighs a mere 5.4 pounds. This is one of the best bags that you can get for around $100. —Adrienne So San Francisco-based Aer is known for its travel bags’ durability and minimalist designs, and the Aer Travel Pack 3 combines both of these with an unreal amount of organization. Our favorite work travel pack in our guide to the Best Carry-on Luggage, this bag can be carried as a backpack or a briefcase. It has a tech-organizing pocket in front of a larger compartment that zips flat to accommodate folded clothes or packing cubes, and it fits neatly under the seat on most airlines’ planes. The only down side is a weirdly small water bottle holder that won’t fit most larger water bottles (precisely the kind you’d want to bring for long trips). —Kat Merck An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale for Black Friday. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell Universal travel adapters are handy to have on your travels and this affordable adapter from Epicka works in more than 150 countries. Sliders reveal common international plugs for the EU, UK, and US, but you can rotate the pins for sockets in Australia or China. You can plug in power-hungry devices, like laptops and camera batteries, but there are also four USB-A ports on the bottom and a 15-watt USB-C port on the side for phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other small gadgets. It’s not the sturdiest option, but it's cheaper than most of the alternatives. This is the budget pick in our best travel adapters guide and is frequently discounted, but well worth buying at this price. —Simon Hill A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So If you want to fly with only an underseat item, the wheels on this teeny, tiny carry-on pop off so you can simply slide it under your seat (although I flew with it on Alaska Airlines and it fit without me taking the wheels off). The wheels are easy to pop off and tuck into the seat pocket. However, they are loud and rattle when you’re walking, especially over rough surfaces like sidewalks. If this doesn’t make you grit your teeth, this tiny suitcase is impressively functional for the price. —Adrienne So The Beis Carry On is viral for a reason. It's not only a beautiful bag, coming in an eye-catching array of colors (I’ve got the bag in the light-blue slate, but the warm brown maple color is always calling my name), but also comes with a bunch of great features. A built-in weight! A bag lock! Two organizer bags that match the color of your bag! A soft cushion for your hand on the handle! If I could take this bag everywhere, I would. It's 30 percent off right now, and Beis doesn't often have sales, so there’s no better time to upgrade your carry-on luggage. —Nena Farrell This duffel bag is great as a weekender or personal item to tote on top of your rolling suitcase. It's also big enough to be a great hospital bag if you suddenly need emergency surgery (yes, that's from experience!) and can be a great bag for all your dance class shoes. The material is sturdy but still stylish, and I find myself grabbing this bag often for all kinds of reasons, from needing to transport multiple water bottles to my weekend trip needs. —Nena Farrell Our favorite toiletry bag for women is the Beis Dopp Kit. It has a handful of handy compartments, and WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane says the water-resistant section is a total game changer when packing liquids or fragrances. It's nice and sturdy, with a wire top that will stay open for you to look through without losing its shape. It's on the large size compared to other Dopp kits, but that means you can truly store everything you need in this kit. If you need even more space, Beis' Cosmetic Case, another Gear team favorite, is 30 percent off. —Nena Farrell Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane This super svelte smart wallet is durable and provides easy and swift access to your cards, thanks to a trigger button that pops them out of the top. It has a leather exterior in a choice of colors. The inside is made from recycled aluminum and holds four regular cards easily, though you can add more cards or cash using the band around the outside. Ekster also offers a ton of optional add-ons, including a tracker card and a multi-tool. I also love the Ekster Cardholder Pro at $84 ($15 off), and the Ekster Grid Backpack for $180 ($45 off) was the perfect way to travel light on my last work trip. —Simon Hill Peak Design's recently revamped Tech Pouch isn't a camera bag, but it's my favorite way to store all the extra stuff I carry—batteries, chargers, cords, SD cards, filters, etc. I fit all that in the nicely subdivided compartments of the tech pouch and then throw the pouch in whichever bag I'm taking with me that day. There are plenty of pockets, and some nice elastic accessory loops to organize all your bits and bobs, and there's even a cable pass-through so you can charge without having to pull out your portable battery. —Scott Gilbertson Though it is bigger than many of the best travel adapters, this versatile gadget covers most of the globe and offers two grounded US AC outlets, a built-in USB-C cable, two USB-A ports (15 watts total), and two USB-C ports (20 watts each). There is surge protection, but this is not a voltage converter. Unfortunately, the two AC outlets are close together, so the size of some plugs can make it challenging to use both simultaneously. But with the ability to charge up to seven devices, this is worth packing in your suitcase. —Simon Hill The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson Wanna be a YouTube star? This is the camera you need. The 18- to 50-mm (f/1.8 to f/4) equivalent zoom lens is plenty sharp and wide, and the Multi-Face Recognition mode is extremely clever and effective. In this mode, the ZV-1 II will detect when another face comes into the scene and automatically stops down the aperture to keep everyone in focus. There are limits, but it works surprisingly well. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson Fujifilm's Instax Link Wide Printer is my favorite Instax printer. The printers aren't as fun as the cameras, but I already have a digital camera, and the results I get pairing images from a real camera with an Instax printer outshine what I get from Instax cameras. If you already have a good digital camera or a solid smartphone camera, an Instax printer is the way to go and this is the best one to get. I love the bigger images of the Link Wide, and it has nice extras like the ability to print multiple images in one go with collage print or add fun features to your images like hearts, glitter (shudder), or any other of the 15 editable templates in the app. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson It’s hard to make videos, OK? Teleprompters can be a game-changer because you have a script! No more floundering and getting frustrated. The models that let your camera sit behind them are best because it doesn’t look obvious that you’re reading text. The Elgato Prompter (8/10, WIRED Recommends) does all of that and supports smartphones too. The companion app turns your script into scrolling text, and the built-in screen is sharp and easy to read. It’s pretty expensive but this deal makes it palatable. —Julian Chokkattu The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson Read next Read next

Title: Bitcoin Well On Track To Hit $740,000 By April 2028 — Pantera CEO

Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital — the first crypto fund in the United States — is forecasting that the price of Bitcoin could smash $700,000 in 2028, roughly a week after the flagship crypto rocketed toward a six-digit price. Despite Bitcoin’s astronomical growth in recent months, Morehead thinks it’s “still early” for BTC and that the cryptocurrency’s bull market has yet to run. Dan Morehead noted in a Nov. 26 blog post that 5% of financial wealth is now exposed to Bitcoin. Yet, that figure is set to increase with more regulatory clarity in the U.S. as pro-blockchain president-elect Donald Trump heads back to the White House. This would result in faster institutionalization of Bitcoin. BlackRock and Fidelity with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have started a “massive transformation,” posited Morehead. “It’s [Bitcoin] already done three orders of magnitude,” Morehead wrote. He revealed that his investment company’s crypto-focused Pantera Bitcoin Fund, which was launched in 2013, has notched an over 131,000% lifetime return on its first Bitcoin purchase at $7. “Another one seems plausible.” Per the Pantera CEO, Bitcoin has been on a trendline that will push its value to roughly $740,000 by April 2028 (a nearly 670% growth from the current price point) if it continues its growth pattern. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was trading for about 2.3% higher at around $95,294 at publication time. “I just can’t help thinking that we still have many more years of very compelling returns.” $740,000 is “not an inconceivable number, relative to $500 trillion in financial assets,” he explained. At this price, Bitcoin would boast a market capitalization of a whopping $15 trillion. “I can imagine an investor thinking: ‘Bitcoin has doubled this year. Well, I guess I missed it,’” Morehead said. “That’s the wrong mindset.” Furthermore, Morehead told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Nov. 27 that he doesn’t think Bitcoin could ever crash to zero now as it has reached “escape velocity” with 300 million investors around the world owning it.

Title: AMD and Alphabet: Billionaire Steve Cohen Loads Up on 2 Big AI Stocks

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AI is booming, providing an important pillar of support for the stock market’s substantial year-to-date gains. Put into numerical terms, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index, which features many of the AI sector’s major names, has added nearly 30% for this year to date – on top of the 43% gains it registered last year. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter The significance of AI, both as a technological force and an investment opportunity, is underscored by the attention it’s garnering from Wall Street titans – the billionaire investors who’ve made fortunes betting on the right trends. Steve Cohen, the founder and CEO of Point72, is among them. Drawing parallels between the current AI boom and the tech revolution of the 1990s, Cohen views AI not as a speculative bubble but as a ‘really durable’ phenomenon poised to reshape industries and markets. More importantly, Cohen is willing to put his money where his mouth is, and is reportedly preparing to set up a new billion-dollar hedge fund to focus on AI stocks. In the meantime, his main firm, Point72, is already betting heavily on AI, and has opened new positions in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), two of the industry’s leaders. According to the data from TipRanks, both AMD and GOOGL feature Strong Buy consensus ratings and double-digit upside potential for the coming year. Let’s give them a closer look, and find out just why billionaire investor Steve Cohen is loading up on these two big AI stocks. Advanced Micro Devices First up is AMD, a leading innovator in the semiconductor chip industry – and a company that is angling to challenge the chip giant Nvidia for a larger slice of the AI pie. While AMD is not in the same trillion-dollar league as the market leader Nvidia – its market cap of ~$229 billion ranks it sixth among its peers – the company has built up a solid business for itself, putting a wide range of top-end PC processor and AI-capable accelerator chips on the market. Among AMD’s leading products are several newly announced chips and chipsets, including the Ryzen 7 9800X3D desktop processor, optimized for high-end gaming uses; the Versal Premium Series Gen 2, designed to improve data movement efficiency and to unlock more memory storage in data-intensive markets; and the Instinct MI300A APU, the market’s second exascale accelerator, designed to power the fastest-ever supercomputer. Whatever the immediate application, the common denominator in all of these is AI – AMD’s newest chips have the speed and capacity to handle data-heavy workloads. That’s by design, of course. AMD has strong relationships, based on its AI-capable chips, with such powerful industry names as Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. With its new product offerings, AMD is aiming to expand its role in the global AI market, which the data aggregation site Statista estimates will reach $92 billion in total revenue by the end of 2025. Steve Cohen evidently thinks AMD will be a major player in the field. During Q3, Point72 opened a new position in AMD. The billionaire hedge manager picked up 871,731 shares of the stock, a holding that is worth over $120 million at the current share price. At the end of last month, AMD reported its results for 3Q24. The company’s quarterly revenue was strong, beating the forecast by $110 million and growing more than 17% year-over-year to reach $6.82 billion. Earnings, reported as a non-GAAP EPS, came to 92 cents per share, in-line with expectations, and up 31% from the prior year. Despite the gains in earnings, shares in AMD are down 17% since the quarterly results were released. While the results were good, investors were disappointed with the firm’s Q4 guidance, which predicted $7.5 billion at the midpoint to the revenue range, below the $7.55 billion that analysts had expected. For TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter, however, the decline in share price creates an opening to buy. Buchalter sums up his bullish view of this stock, writing, “We view AMD’s forward roadmap and progress on building its networking ecosystem reinforcing our confidence it can create and capture value in AI computing. Against a very large and still early AI compute TAM, we believe AMD is well on the way to cementing its position as the de facto merchant alternative to NVIDIA’s leadership position.” The analyst follows this with a Buy rating on the stock, and adds a $185 price target that indicates potential for a 34% gain in the next 12 months. (To watch Buchalter’s track record, click here) The 30 recent analyst reviews on AMD break down 23-to-7 in favor of Buy over Hold, giving the shares their consensus rating of Strong Buy. The $137.72 trading price and $185.46 average target price together imply a potential one-year upside of 34.5%. (See AMD stock forecast) Alphabet Now we’ll turn to Alphabet, the parent company of the internet’s leading search engine, Google, and leading video platform, YouTube. Through these subsidiaries, Alphabet holds the world-leading position in the field of internet search – but more importantly, the company has access to a treasure trove of raw data, the feedstock of AI applications. While the online advertising business based on that data trove has pushed Alphabet to a market cap over $2 trillion, making it the fifth-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street, it’s the company’s AI bent that is more likely to propel it into the future. Alphabet already makes use of AI to improve results from its search engines, both Google and YouTube, using the tech to offer search suggestions and to target relevant ads to web surfers. Precise ad targeting is key, as Alphabet’s revenue stream comes mainly from its online advertising segment. In addition to its uses in web search and digital advertising, AI is essential to Alphabet’s online translation capabilities. AI-powered large language models (LLMs) allow the company to conduct its ad business around the world in the audiences’ native tongues, and to offer automated translation services that expand users’ horizons to websites outside of their native languages. All of this builds into Alphabet’s Gemini platform, the company’s purpose-built, customer-facing, generative AI platform. Alphabet’s platform is already working with large language models, and can even help users with complex tasks such as computer coding. Alphabet is working to expand Gemini into all of its products – but especially into its Android smartphone operating system. That last will bring a functional AI assistant into the world of smartphone applications, and from there the vistas are endless. Turning to Steve Cohen’s recent GOOGL buys, we find that he bought big last quarter – to the tune of 1,159,225 shares. At the current price, this new position is worth approximately $196 million. In its last quarterly report, for 3Q24, Alphabet’s management stated that the company saw strong success in its core revenue-driving business of online advertising. The company’s ~90% market share in online search provides a strong foundation for the digital ad business. Alphabet’s revenues in the third quarter came to $88.3 billion, growing almost 15% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $2.05 billion. The company’s EPS was also strong, up 37% year-over-year to reach $2.12 per share – and beating the forecast by 27 cents per share. In coverage for Pivotal Research Group, analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak takes note of Alphabet’s leading position in online search and advertising, as well as the company’s strong business lines in AI and cloud computing. He writes of the internet giant, “If the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which as evidenced by the 3Q acceleration in revenue growth has dramatic growth potential given still relatively low (15-20%) cloud market share of enterprise workloads (+ benefits from AI), controls the largest video/audio streaming platform in the world (YouTube) and the world’s top browser (Chrome) with a 65% global market share (ex-China).” Looking ahead, Wlodarczak puts a Buy rating on GOOGL shares, with a $225 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 33%. (To watch Wlodarczak’s track record, click here) The Strong Buy consensus rating on Alphabet is based on 34 recent Wall Street reviews that favor Buy over Hold by 27 to 7. The shares are priced at $169.12 and the $207.9 average price target points toward a 23% gain in the year ahead.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 AI News Updates Wall Street Is Monitoring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI news updates that Wall Street is monitoring. AI companies in the United States, many of whom have extensive business relations in China, are waiting anxiously for President-elect Donald Trump to assume office and announce possible changes to American policies towards China that will provide greater clarity on future US trade with the Asian country. Top executives from US-based firms were in China recently to meet with Chinese business leaders amid rumors of a massive spike in tariffs on goods being imported to Washington from Beijing. Latest reports from news platform Axios contend that Donald Trump is considering the appointment of an AI czar in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Per the report, billionaire Elon Musk, who has publicly backed Trump during the 2024 election and is rumored to have a key influence over the President-elect on AI policy, will not be the AI czar. However, the report adds that Musk is nevertheless expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases related to AI. xAI, the AI startup Musk founded in 2023, recently raised $5 billion in a funding round. The latest round of funding brought the valuation of the startup to over $50 billion. xAI is competing with OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker with a valuation of more than $157 billion.

(NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. On November 26, telecom news platform Capacity reported that the chipmaker had released the latest version of its ROCm software stack for GPUs, adding tools to cut down AI development times. The report underlined that Version 6.3 of the open source software stack aims to provide better performance and scalability for AI and high-performance computing workloads on AMD Instinct GPUs, like the new MI325X. Overall, AMD ranks 7th on our list of AI news updates Wall Street is monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone, or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Cyber Monday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Cyber Monday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Cyber Monday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Save money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad first. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. However, there are some discounts on previous models: U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Cyber Monday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85 percent (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75 percent off at $1.99 a month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is offering subscriptions for $8 a month, 50 percent off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV+, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-day trial or even Apple’s 3 months for free if you buy an Apple product. In fact, there are even some Cyber Monday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it. See our round-up of the Best Apple TV deals. U.S. U.K. In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these roundups for the best Apple deals: Check out these time-limited tech deals before they go.

The back garden is knitted into the dunes, with specific decks on which to enjoy a tipple of your choice. It also has an outdoor terrace at the end of the extensive living area that faced west to catch sunsets; the roof of the terrace was carved in the shape of a keel, to honour the owner’s legacy of sailing. Inside, the living areas are well considered, with a long sittingroom graduating into a Snaidero kitchen. The house splits into two levels, with a study set between them on the landing. The views from The Lake House over the sea were staggering, and it was clear that the previous owner had loved every minute of living there.

Achieved in excess of its asking price, according to selling agent John Radford. It appears on the Property Price Register as having sold for €1.35 million in October 2024, which accounts for the house on one acre. The remainder of land, almost 27 acres, was sold separately. Situated along Wexford’s historic Norman Way, this Georgian residence dates all the way back to 1801. Though described on the National Built Heritage website as “a farmhouse”, the five-bedroom pile extends to a considerable 483sq m (5,198sq ft). Lying on almost 30 acres, the grounds have two paddocks, four stables and a hay barn likely to have attracted those who wish to entertain equestrian pursuits. In addition to its pristine condition, as owners who had lived there since 1997 had restored it fully to its former glory, there is a restored coach house, offering a large livingroom and games room. Add to this a 13m swimming pool and its proximity to a number of beaches and golf courses, along with access to fresh fish at nearby Kilmore Quay, and you can understand why it was on the market for such a short time. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: On the market through Sherry FitzGerald Catherine O’Reilly since October, seeking €695,000. Lynam Cottage has been my favourite house reviewed by The Irish Times this year, not just for its postcard-perfect exterior, light-filled interior and stunning surroundings, but for the fact that it introduced me to the story of its namesake – the author, journalist, linguist and administrator Joan (Shevawn) Lynam. Elizabeth Birdthistle’s research into Lynam, who bought and refurbished the cottage in the 1960s, painted a portrait of a fascinating woman who worked for Alfred Hitchcock, worked and wrote for various media outlets, and who was passionate about Basque independence and found herself banned from Spain for a time because of it. She put her knowledge of the region into a novel, The Spirit and the Clay, which she set during the Spanish Civil War. Lynam wrote her second book, Humanity Dick – a biography of eccentric TD Richard Martin – no doubt surrounded by the rolling Wicklow hills at the cottage. And today, following a thorough renovation by its current owners, Lynam Cottage is an idyllic retreat – the envy of writers and artists alike. It also incorporates some of my favourite interior features, such as a checkerboard floor at its entrance, skylights in the living areas and a window seat overlooking the countryside. Read our full review here. – Jessica Doyle Status: Brought to the market by Sherry FitzGerald seeking €10 million in September, and went sale-agreed that month, according to the selling agent. The selling price has yet to be confirmed, and it has yet to appear on the Property Price Register. Hidden away down a long driveway off Sandycove Avenue East, this very private period home on three-quarters of an acre of gardens that run down to the sea is a few minutes’ walk from the Forty Foot and Joyce Tower. The 594sq m (6,394sq ft) five-bedroom villa-style detached house, built in 1840, was effectively rebuilt and completely modernised over the past 24 years. Inside, it’s all bright, modern and warm (it has a B3 Ber), with rooms opening on to terraces that look over the formal gardens to the sea. A separate two-storey studio mews is accessed from Sandycove Lane. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: On the market with Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since September, seeking €3.8 million. It may seem obvious to choose a very large period property in Rathmines as the home that stood out for me in 2024, but it wasn’t the sheer size of it or the Dublin 6 address that impressed me most, it was how the house was lived in. This six-bedroom home, measuring 410sq m (4,413sq ft), is set out over three floors, with every corner in use. For the last 22 years it has worked around family life, so there were no rooms that were kept out of bounds for visitors’ eyes only. The ground-floor level adapted to every stage, from toddlers to teenagers. The reception rooms are both refined and relaxed, with the shuttered sash windows facing out to Brookfield Tennis Club. And the beauty of it all is that number 5 has not lost an ounce of its period charm along the way. Here’s hoping it goes to another family that will fill each room with life and love. Read our full review here. – Alison Gill Status: Came to the market with Knight Frank in September seeking €2.1 million. Property is still on the market, but under offer. This semidetached end-terrace house was one of three Regency-style houses inspired by the developer Gerry Walsh’s love of the musical Oliver! and the famous Who Will Buy scene, set at a Regency terrace in Bath. To him, it symbolised beauty and harmony, and he sought to recreate homes with the same style and flair, taking years to assemble plots of land until he could build the terrace. Every corner, every space, every window and door was drawn and redrawn up to 200 times, and the meticulous attention to detail means every room, lobby and hallway works. The garden received the same exigent level of oversight, with each limestone slab on the patio individually chosen, pleached pear trees, and every bit of outside hardware, such as the downpipes, are of the highest quality. Walsh installed a Snaidero kitchen not just on the ground level, which has an open-plan kitchen, living and dining area and a pretty sittingroom to the front, but also in the utility room in the basement, along with a gym and home cinema. I particularly love the elegance of the stairs and its long mahogany banister running continuously over the house’s three floors. Read our full review here. – Miriam Mulcahy Status: On sale through Knight Frank since October, seeking €7.75 million. Imagine the perfect weekend: your best friends are in Dublin to watch Ireland beat the All Blacks at the Aviva Stadium in Ballsbridge. After the match you repair to Rob Kearney and Jamie Heaslip’s pub The Bridge 1859 for a few celebratory scoops, followed by a steak dinner in Roly’s Bistro. Then it’s all back to your new abode at number 23 Elgin Road, where the party really gets started. This four-bed Victorian home in the heart of Dublin’s embassy belt, and done up to the nines by interior designer Jane Gilloway, is the perfect place for entertaining guests in style. You can put your friends and their families up in two luxury bedroom suites in the side extension, and in the two substantial detached modern mews houses at the end of the back garden. Gilloway has added plenty of showstopping touches to the elegant period home, including antique cast-iron radiators, Jacobean stained-timber floors and, in the kitchen/breakfastroom, Paonazzo honed marble worktops. With a spacious media room, pool table, fully equipped bar, wine room and integrated sound system, it offers all the ingredients for a marvellous party – and a luxurious lifestyle. Read our full review here. – Kevin Courtney Status: Brought to market by Sherry FitzGerald in June seeking €2.45 million. It went sale-agreed for over the asking price in August, says Michael Grehan of Sherry FitzGerald. An end-of-terrace Victorian five-bed with a pale pink exterior in an enclave of otherwise mostly redbrick homes off Rock Road, opposite Blackrock College, was at various times a school “for the education of young ladies”, a Protestant boarding house and also the home of a famous Irish bell-maker. It sold relatively quickly – overlooking Blackrock Park, the Dart line and the sea, its location was likely a strong selling point. Built in 1844, but Georgian in style, with bow windows and nearly floor-to-ceiling multi-paned new sash windows, Montereau had been modernised, with smart new bathrooms and kitchen – but there was still room to revamp the basement and a garage beside the house. Read our full review here. – Frances O’Rourke Status: Brought to the market in February 2024 with an asking price of €1.75 million. It was later listed at €1.5 million for auction, where it sold for €1.675 million according to selling agent Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty. This lovely two-storey, four-bay 260sq m (2,800sq ft) Victorian structure dates from 1895 and lies along one of the quietest roads in Sutton. It retains some unusual decorative embellishments of Indian accent, such as it ogee-headed arches to the veranda, as described on Fingal County Council’s record of protected structures. While its architectural origins have been lost to the annals of time, its Indian connection was presumed to be due to the fact that its first resident was a Dutch sea captain, with links to the Dutch East Indies and the East India Trading Company. And, although it would benefit from some upgrading, it has spectacular details such as elaborate window mouldings and striking cornicing. But what impressed most was its location, overlooking the sea with super views from rooms to the front. In addition, its southwesterly aspect allows for spectacular sunsets from these rooms, as the property is angled to maximise its expanse of views across Dublin Bay. It had been home to the Beshoff fish and chip family since 1978, until it sold earlier this year. Read our full review here. – Elizabeth Birdthistle Status: For sale through Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty since August, seeking €7.5 million. If you want to be lord of the manor in your own big estate, you usually have to head out to the countryside, but Tinnahinch is a classic country pile transplanted into the south Dublin suburb of Foxrock. This expansive Georgian-style home is built to the highest standards, with period features including Flemish bond facade, Portland stone sills and bespoke oak joinery. There’s a grand entrance hall and gallery landing, richly appointed reception rooms, spacious kitchen/diningroom and luxurious bedrooms. What really completes the idyllic picture is the 1.7 acres of lush gardens landscaped in the style of 19th-century Irish gardener William Robinson, who pioneered the move away from formal gardens to a wilder, more naturalistic style. The gardens are a magical mix of native and exotic plants, with winding paths, wooden bridges, tumbling waterfalls and serene lily ponds, with numerous spots to relax, read a book or dine al fresco.

Title: Graphology
URL: https://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Graphology
Time Published: 2024-11-28T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Graphology (or graphoanalysis, but not graphanalysis) is the analysis of the physical characteristics and patterns of handwriting purporting to be able to identify the writer, indicating psychological state at the time of writing, or evaluating personality characteristics.[1] It is generally considered a pseudoscience.[2][3][4][5][6] The term is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to forensic document examination due to the fact that aspects of the latter dealing with the examination of handwritten documents are occasionally referred to as the frequently confused term graphanalysis. Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the anecdotal evidence of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters.[7][8] The word Graphology is derived from grapho- (from the Greek γραφή, "writing") and logos (from the Greek λόγος, which relates to discussion or theory).[9] Jean-Charles Gille-Maisani stated in 1991 that Juan Huarte de San Juan's 1575 Examen de ingenios para las ciencias was the first book on handwriting analysis.[10][11] In American graphology, Camillo Baldi's Trattato come da una lettera missiva si conoscano la natura e qualita dello scrittore from 1622 is considered to be the first book.[12][13] Around 1830 Jean-Hippolyte Michon became interested in handwriting analysis. He published his findings[14][15] shortly after founding Société Graphologique in 1871. The most prominent of his disciples was Jules Crépieux-Jamin who rapidly published a series of books[16][17] that were soon published in other languages.[18][19] Starting from Michon's integrative approach, Crépieux-Jamin founded a holistic approach to graphology. Alfred Binet was convinced to conduct research into graphology from 1893 to 1907. He called it "the science of the future" despite rejection of his results by graphologists. After World War I, interest in graphology continued to spread in Europe as well as the United States. In Germany during the 1920s, Ludwig Klages founded and published his finding in Zeitschrift für Menschenkunde (Journal for the Study of Mankind). His major contribution to the field can be found in Handschrift und Charakter.[20][21] Thea Stein Lewinson and J. Zubin modified Klage's ideas, based upon their experience working for the U.S. government, publishing their method in 1942.[22] In 1929 Milton Bunker founded The American Grapho Analysis Society teaching Graphoanalysis. This organization and its system split the American graphology world in two. Students had to choose between graphoanalysis or holistic graphology. While hard data is lacking, anecdotal evidence indicates that 10% of the members of International Graphoanalysis Society (IGAS) were expelled between 1970 and 1980.[23] Regarding a proposed correlation between gender and handwriting style, a paper by published by James Hartley in 1989 concluded that there was some evidence in support of this hypothesis.[24] Although graphology had some support in the scientific community before the mid-twentieth century, more recent research rejects the validity of graphology as a tool to assess personality and job performance,[2][25][26] and today it is considered to be a pseudoscience.[2][3][4][5][6][27] Graphology is primarily used as a recruiting tool to screen candidates during the evaluation process. Many studies have been conducted to assess its effectiveness to predict personality and job performance. Recent studies testing the validity of using handwriting for predicting personality traits and job performance have been consistently negative.[2][25] In a 1987 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire using writing samples from the same people.[8] In a 1988 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Myers-Briggs test using writing samples from the same people.[28] A 1982 meta-analysis drawn from over 200 studies concludes that graphologists were generally unable to predict any kind of personality trait on any personality test.[29] Measures of job performance appear similarly unrelated to the handwriting metrics of graphologists. Professional graphologists using handwriting analysis were just as ineffective as lay people at predicting performance in a 1989 study.[30] A broad literature screen done by King and Koehler confirmed dozens of studies showing the geometric aspects of graphology (slant, slope, etc.) are essentially worthless predictors of job performance.[25] Rowan Bayne, a British psychologist who has written several studies on graphology, summarized his view of the appeal of graphology: "[i]t's very seductive because at a very crude level someone who is neat and well behaved tends to have neat handwriting", adding that the practice is "useless... absolutely hopeless".[31] The British Psychological Society ranks graphology alongside astrology, giving them both "zero validity".[31] Graphology was also dismissed as a pseudo-science by the skeptic James Randi in 1991.[32] In his May 21, 2013 Skeptoid podcast episode titled "All About Graphology," scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning reports:[6] In his book The Write Stuff, Dr. Barry Beyerstein summarized the work of Dr. Geoffrey Dean, who performed probably the most extensive literature survey of graphology ever done. Dean did a meta-analysis on some 200 studies: Dean showed that graphologists have failed unequivocally to demonstrate the validity or reliability of their art for predicting work performance, aptitudes, or personality. Graphology thus fails according to the standards a genuine psychological test must pass before it can ethically be released for use on an unsuspecting public. Dean found that no particular school of graphology fared better than any other... In fact, no graphologist of any stripe was able to show reliably better performance than untrained amateurs making guesses from the same materials. In the vast majority of studies, neither group exceeded chance expectancy. Dunning concludes:[6] Other divining techniques like iridology, phrenology, palmistry, and astrology also have differing schools of thought, require years of training, offer expensive certifications, and fail just as soundly when put to a scientific controlled test. Handwriting analysis does have its plausible-sounding separation from those other techniques though, and that's the whole "handwriting is brainwriting" idea — traits from the brain will be manifested in the way that it controls the muscles of the hand. Unfortunately, this is just as unscientific as the others. No amount of sciencey sounding language can make up for a technique failing when put to a scientifically controlled test. Max Pulver supports a system called symbolic analysis in which he looks for symbols in the handwriting.[38][39][40][41] Each approach to handwriting analysis has spawned several systems. Integrative graphology focuses on strokes and their relation to personality.[42] Graphoanalysis was the most influential system in the United States, between 1929 and 2000. The Sistema de Xandró is another method of integrative graphology.[43][44][45] Holistic graphology is based on form, movement, and use of space.[42] The psychogram[12][46][47] is another method which uses specific diagrams to analyze handwriting. The Personal Worth Chart is one such method developed by the Handwriting Consultants of San Diego[48] during the early 1980s. The psychograph is an additional psychogram method.[49] was developed by Leslie King during the 1970s .The Wittlich Character Diagram,[50][51] and the Muller-Enskat Protokol[52][53] are other psychogram methods. Psychologists Leopold Szondi, Augusto Vels, and Girolamo Moretti invented their personal schools of graphology.[54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65] Four academic institutions offer an accredited degree in handwriting analysis: The majority of material in the field is oriented toward the Latin writing system. Courses offered in the subject reflect that bias. Every system of handwriting analysis has its own vocabulary. Even though two or more systems may share the same words, the meanings of those words may be different. The technical meaning of a word used by a handwriting analyst, and the common meaning is not congruent. Resentment, for example, in common usage, means to feel or exhibit annoyance. In Graphoanalysis, the term indicates a fear of imposition.[68][69] A report by the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information says that handwriting analysis without informed consent is a privacy violation.[70] There have been a number of studies on gender and handwriting.[71][72][73][74] Uniformly the research indicates that gender can be determined at a significant level. The published studies on ethnicity,[75][76][77] race,[78][79][80] age,[81][82][83] nationality,[84] gender orientation, weight, and their relationship to handwriting have had mixed results. One of the rules of thumb in human resources is that if an individual who has an ADA-defined disability cannot take a test, then nobody can. As a result, tests that cannot be adapted for use by those individuals will not be used by a company. Handwriting clearly falls into the group of tests that cannot be adapted to be administered to individuals who fall within one or more ADA-defined disabilities. Blind people, for example, do not develop the required fluency in handwriting, for the writing to be correctly analyzed. Questions that handwriting analysts ask before doing an analysis can be illegal under this act.[85] A company takes a writing sample provided by an applicant, and proceeds to do a personality profile, matching the congruency of the applicant with the ideal psychological profile of employees in the position.[86] A graphological report is meant to be used in conjunction with other tools, such as comprehensive background checks, practical demonstration or record of work skills. Graphology supporters state that it can complement but not replace traditional hiring tools. Research in employment suitability has ranged from complete failure[87] to guarded success.[88] The most substantial reason for not using handwriting analysis in the employment process is the absence of evidence of a direct link between handwriting analysis and various measures of job performance.[89] The use of graphology in the hiring process has been criticized on ethical grounds[90] and on legal grounds in the United States.[91] Graphology has been used clinically by European counselors and psychotherapists.[50][51][52][53] When it is used, it is generally used alongside other projective personality assessment tools, and not in isolation. It is often used within individual psychotherapy, marital counseling, or vocational counseling.[92] In its simplest form only sexual expression and sexual response are examined. At its most complex, every aspect of an individual is examined for how it affects the other individual(s) within the relationship.[93] The theory is that after knowing and understanding how each individual in the relationship differs from every other individual in the relationship, the resulting marriage will be more enduring.[94] Medical graphology is probably the most controversial branch of handwriting analysis.[95] Strictly speaking, such research is not graphology as described throughout this article but an examination of factors pertaining to motor control. Research studies have been conducted in which a detailed examination of handwriting factors, particularly timing, fluidity, pressure, and consistency of size, form, speed, and pressure are considered in the process of evaluating patients and their response to pharmacological therapeutic agents.[96] The study of these phenomena is a by-product of researchers investigating motor control processes and the interaction of nervous, anatomical, and biomechanical systems of the body. The Vanguard Code of Ethical Practice, amongst others, prohibits medical diagnosis by those not licensed to do diagnosis in the state in which they practice. This is the practice of changing a person's handwriting with the goal of changing features of his or her personality. It originated in France during the 1930s, spreading to the United States in the late 1950s.[97][98] The purported therapy consists of a series of exercises which are similar to those taught in basic calligraphy courses, sometimes in conjunction with music or positive self-talk.
