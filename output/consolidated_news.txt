Title: Exclusive Poll: Majority of Americans Oppose ESG as State Financial Officers Fight Against It

A majority of Americans oppose controversial environment, social, and governance (ESG) policies, which state financial officers across the nation have committed to fighting, Breitbart News has learned exclusively. A survey conducted by TargetPoint, exclusively obtained by Breitbart News, found that 56 percent of Americans agree that “ESG is a highly subjective, politically charged idea that is forcing progressive policies on everyday Americans resulting in higher prices for nearly everything.” In contrast, 27 percent disagreed with that statement, and 17 percent did not know enough to register an opinion. Eighty-eight percent agreed that the government should focus more on protecting individual rights so that Americans can achieve prosperity, and 86 percent agreed that open debate and civil discourse should be encouraged to find solutions to financial and policy challenges. ESG has become the latest vector through which Wall Street asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Baillie Gifford & Company, and others push companies to adopt leftist policies they otherwise would not back. Asset managers often push companies to adopt policies intended to fight climate change, diversity requirements, and other policies advocating for racial justice. O.J. Oleka, the CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), said in a statement to Breitbart News that the poll reveals that Americans are increasingly tired of corporations becoming politicized. He said: When asked who they might trust most to make the right decisions on fiscal and financial matters, 47 percent pointed to state financial officers, 31 percent said governors, and 22 percent said congressional lawmakers. Americans trust state financial officers more than governors, attorneys general, and legislators when it comes managing a state’s finances, overseeing state investments, ensuring taxpayer dollars are efficiently spent, and ensuring financial transparency. Many large asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have infamously pushed controversial policies through proxy voting. Here are some of BlackRock and Baillie Gifford’s most egregious proxy votes: State financial officers have fought back against this sort of leftist encroachment in corporate America. The same year, Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ (R) blacklisted 13 financial institutions deemed to be boycotting the energy industry. In 2022, Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, banned BlackRock and nine other finance firms from working with the Lone Star State after they declared their hostility to fossil fuels. “The environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,” Hegar said in a statement at the time. The strong pushback against ESG, in part from state financial officers, led BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in 2023 to lament that he no longer uses the term “ESG” as it has been “weaponized.” “We have a mandate to keep fighting to protect the American people’s money from the disaster that is woke political ideology,” Oleka concluded. Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks, the State Financial Officers Foundation national chairman, told Breitbart News, “These results are certainly encouraging, but not surprising. Families in Utah and nationwide care deeply about their financial security, not just for themselves but for future generations,” he said. “They see radical forces and ideologies being financed with their dollars and rightly expect us to push back. That’s what every SFOF member is doing.” “We won’t rest until these political movements are no longer threatening Americans with our own money to put far-left politics over retirement profits,” he vowed.

Are households owning individual stocks or stocks in an ETF/mutual fund. How they own stocks makes a difference. if a majority of the investors are prone to panic sell, the market may reflect that... but not for long. Can’t have the proletariat making money like our rulers. yup....left wing media: Americans not saving money??? Bad Americans investing int he stock market? Bad bttt The article is referring to individual accounts. BlackRock has no authority to buy, sell, or vote the stock shares of individual accounts, unless the individual has contracted with BlackRock to manage the account. BlackRock has no authority to buy, sell, or vote the stock shares of individual accounts, unless the individual has contracted with BlackRock to manage the account. “Can’t have the proletariat making money like our rulers.” ___________________________________________________________ The regular “household” investor is supposed to be the patsy. As long as the post WW2 inflationary market holds up, the index fund investors who have held their holdings throughout numerous economic storms should perform nicely. The wildcard, which I don’t forsee happening anytime soon, would be the type of deflationary pressure that hit in the mid 1920’s and continued throughout the 1930’s. In that environment, you would want to hold dividend paying companies that held up their valuations the best, as well as holding a strong cash position and protecting your money in Treasuries. I have bought more stock in the last month than all of last year. Ladies and Gentlemen I give you GAMESTOP and the Robinhood rip off. To The Moon!!! Who reads the article? ;-) U.S. households are more invested in stocks than ever and it’s distorting market valuation, says JPMorgan Didn’t she once flash her boobs on The Gong Show? A majority of USA investors hold some or all their money in ETFs and Funds. Regardless, that still impacts the P/E Ratio of the individual stocks in the ETFs and Funds. Regardless, that still impacts the P/E Ratio of the individual stocks in the ETFs and Funds. We’ve been taught over the last 40 years that the only thing that beats inflation is stocks. Don’t blame the people for drawing the only sane conclusion. JP Morgan thinks ordinary Americans are saving and investing too much money? Maybe it’s time for JPMorgan to exit the equities markets and switch to bitcoin, fine art (Hunter Biden paintings are at a discount right now), and politicians’ futures. Buying and owning politicians is still out of reach for rank and file Americans, but for JPMorgan, it’s a natural. Real estate used to be a sound investment for the little guys, and in some places it still is, but in blue cities and states, it puts a “tax me” sign on people’s backs. JPMorgan is big enough to hedge on Ukrainian farmground, especially given its ability to play the politicians futures markets, but that is beyond most of us. Where does JPMorgan suggest middle class Americans park their retirement savings? Passbook savings accounts? This is why I’m 74% in T-Bills and a few Bonds. Stock/Bond account is right at a record high though, so that’s good. I hold 7 stocks, 5 of which pay good dividends. Slow and steady is fine at my age, I don’t even touch any of this money, it’s for the heirs if I don’t blow it. In other words, only the elites should get to control the stock market.

Stock and other traditional financial asset traders across the world are wanting to be able to buy and sell assets around the clock, resulting in two of the biggest stock markets in the U.S., Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) making moves to offer round-the-clock trading soon. “We definitely see that this is where the markets are moving,” said Giang Bui, Nasdaq’s head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products, speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on Thursday. “There's a lot of demand globally for U.S. stocks and people want to trade within the hours that they're typically awake, and I think a lot of it is because people are used to trading crypto 24/7.” Both Nasdaq and the NYSE are in the process of receiving approval to open their venues 24 hours a day, for five or even seven days a week. Nasdaq recently announced that it had begun engaging with regulators about the change while the NYSE has already received the green light. Round-the-clock trading can have several advantages for markets, including increased volume and market liquidity as traders aren’t tied to specific time zones. Currently, the U.S. stock market opens for trading at 9:30 a.m. ET and closes at 4 p.m. ET. “We're hearing it across the board from global broker dealers, clients who they're servicing, even within the U.S., there's a number of U.S. brokers that already are offering overnight trading because their customers are used to trading crypto in those hours,” Bui added. Nasdaq lists a number of crypto-related products, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the spot ETF issued by BlackRock, which saw the most successful ETF debut in the history of U.S. ETF launches. Earlier today, the exchange listed two Solana (SOL) futures ETFs issued by Volatility Shares.

Title: If You Invested $10K In Lamar Advertising Stock 10 Years Ago, How Much Would You Have Now?

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Lamar Advertising Company LAMR operates as an outdoor advertising company in the U.S. and Canada. It is set to report its Q1 2025 earnings on May 1. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post EPS of $1.09, up from $0.76 in the year-ago period. According to Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to reach $539.19 million, up from $498.15 million a year earlier. Don't Miss: The company's stock traded at approximately $59.06 per share 10 years ago. If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 169 shares. Currently, shares trade at $113.57, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $19,230 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Lamar Advertising also paid dividends during these 10 years. Lamar Advertising's dividend yield is currently 5.46%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $40.28 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,820 from dividends alone. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Summing up $19,230 and $6,820, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $26,050. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Lamar Advertising stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 160.5%. However, this figure is significantly less than the S&P 500 total return for the same period, which was 223.6%. Lamar Advertising has a consensus rating of "Neutral" and a price target of $132.33 based on the ratings of six analysts. The price target implies more than 16% potential upside from the current stock price. On Feb. 20, the company announced its Q4 2024 earnings, posting revenues of $579.567 million, missing the consensus estimate of $583.190 million, as reported by Benzinga. See Also: Have $200K saved? Here's how to turn it into lasting wealth “Our revenue growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, aided by strength in political, local and programmatic. This allowed us to deliver full-year AFFO of $7.99 per share, above the top end of our revised guidance range,” said CEO Sean Reilly. “For 2025, we anticipate further growth in diluted AFFO, to a range of $8.13 to $8.28 per share.” Given the expected upside potential, growth-focused investors may find Lamar Advertising stock attractive. Furthermore, they can benefit from the company's solid dividend yield of 5.46%. Check out this article by Benzinga for three more stocks offering high dividend yields.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Photo: Shutterstock/Strikernia (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. warned of a deteriorating global business environment due to geopolitical and trade tensions, as the Hong Kong conglomerate reported weaker-than-expected profit while a ports sale plan faces uncertainty after infuriating Beijing. Billionaire Li Ka-shing’s flagship firm reported a 27% decline in net income to HK$17.1 billion ($2.2 billion) for 2024, missing analyst expectations for HK$22.5 billion, according to a statement Thursday. Revenue came in at HK$476.7 billion, compared with HK$462 billion a year earlier. It announced a full-year dividend of HK$2.2 per share, compared with HK$2.53 per share a year before. CK Hutchison, now led by Li’s son Victor Li, has been caught in the crosshairs of increasing tensions between the US and China since it announced an agreement to sell 43 ports — including two in Panama — to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. While the conglomerate is set to make $19 billion in cash proceeds from the deal, the agreement has enraged Beijing after President Donald Trump touted it as reclaiming the Panama canal. “The operating environment for the group’s businesses is expected to be both volatile and unpredictable,” Chairman Victor Li said in the statement. He cautioned about headwinds from geopolitical developments, which could in turn spawn supply chain disruptions in the early part of 2025. The group will rein in capital spending and new investment, while tasking its businesses to increase productivity and reduce operating spending, Li said. Several Chinese state agencies are studying CK Hutchison’s ports deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations, Bloomberg reported earlier this week. It’s unclear what levers China can pull to block the deal, given that it involves the company’s overseas assets only. The group has kept all of its ports in Hong Kong and mainland China. CK Hutchison’s statement didn’t mention the sale of its ports portfolio, including the two terminals it operates in the Panama canal. While the group typically holds press and analyst briefings following the announcement of its annual results, they were skipped this year, highlighting the sensitivity of the deal. The company reported an 11% increase in revenue at its ports and related services business, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rising 19%, helped by more export activities in a port in southern China, as well as supply chain relocations benefiting ports in Asia and Latin America. But the ports sector remains CK Hutchison’s smallest revenue contributor with an input of 9%, falling behind other businesses including retail, infrastructure and telecommunications. The group has reported progress in a planned merger of its £15 billion UK telecoms business with Vodafone Group Plc, which secured approval from the country’s antitrust authorities. The group is working with the authorities to put in place the final undertakings in order to close the transaction within the first half of this year, it said in the statement. Meanwhile, investors have boosted options bets to an eight-year high, as they await more clues on the ports deal, a definitive agreement for which is expected to be signed by April 2. The group’s operations in Hong Kong and mainland China mainly include ports in places like Shenzhen and Shanghai, supermarkets, health and beauty retail, telecommunications and biotech development. These businesses could become targets if Chinese authorities decide to penalize the company for selling to the US what they view as strategic assets to China’s interest. But the group’s diversified global portfolio could help ease the impact of a potential political fallout. Hong Kong and China accounted for 12% of revenue in 2024, while Europe, Canada and Australia made up the bulk of the rest. The Li family’s real estate arm CK Asset Holdings Ltd. reported net income of HK$13.7 billion, compared to HK$17.3 billion in the previous year. Hong Kong, the company’s main property market, has been experiencing a prolonged downturn due to expensive interest rates and an oversupply of homes. CK, along with other developers in the city, will have to offer apartments on the cheap to lure buyers. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR APPLOVIN INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On February 26, 2025, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research both published reports alleging, among other things, that AppLovin is using a “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones” and is “stealing data from Meta in their e-commerce push.” On this news, AppLovin’s stock price fell $46.06, or 12.2%, to close at $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) AppLovin is exploiting advert data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 5, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: All part of the plan: Apple TV+ loses $1 billion a year
URL: https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-tv-loses-money
Time Published: 2025-03-20T15:30:31Z
Full Content:
By David Snow • 8:30 am, March 20, 2025 As Apple TV+’s subscriber base continues to grow and the streamer enjoys lots of attention on Friday’s Severance season 2 finale, a new report Thursday suggests the streaming service remains a financial loser for the iPhone giant — to the tune of $1 billion in losses annually. And yet it should come as no surprise Apple TV+ bleeds money. A fat billion a year in the red sounds bad, but it’s pretty much in line with the plan for losses of up to $20 billion over a decade for the still-nascent streaming service. Launched in 2019, Apple TV+ gives subscribers access to an ever-growing catalog of exclusive TV shows and movies. Still, that catalog remains quite small relative to other streaming services. Apple consistently ranks high when it comes to quality over quantity, but that focus isn’t necessarily paying off — at least in the short term. Despite reaching about 45 million subscribers last year, Apple TV+ remains the only unprofitable service in Apple’s expanding services portfolio, according to The Information. The report indicates Apple invested more than $5 billion annually on content since the service’s 2019 launch. But subsequent pressure from CEO Tim Cook and other executives reportedly trimmed that budget by $500 million in 2024. This financial scrutiny appears to have intensified in recent years. The Information reports that Cook personally questioned several movie deals, including the spy action-comedy Argylle starring Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa. The $200 million production apparently drew Cook’s criticism for failing to attract a significant audience or generate substantial new subscribers. Apple’s streaming service continues to represent a small fraction of the U.S. streaming market, accounting for less than 1% of total viewing time. By comparison, Netflix and Amazon captured 8.2% and 3.5% of total viewing time in February, respectively. Despite these worrisome figures, Apple’s initial business plan for the streaming service anticipated losses between $15 billion and $20 billion over its first decade. Such losses are not unusual in the streaming industry, though they represent a departure from Apple’s typically disciplined fiscal approach. Services chief Eddy Cue initially sheltered Apple TV+ executives from budget scrutiny. He even rejected proposals for increased oversight of programming costs. However, following successes like CODA winning the Oscar for Best Picture, Cook reportedly began more closely monitoring the service’s financial performance starting in 2022. One area that faced particular scrutiny was the use of private jets for talent, which reportedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per flight. This scrutiny led Apple to seek better deals with flight-chartering companies. The report suggests Apple’s services division faces wider challenges beyond Apple TV+. Despite services being Apple’s fastest-growing and most profitable category — with gross margins exceeding 75%, compared to just under 40% for hardware — several offerings appear to struggle. For example, Apple Music reportedly saw growth stagnate recently. It remains “only marginally profitable,” with single-digit-percentage gross margins, because Apple pays more than 70% of revenue to artists and labels. Cue reportedly expressed doubts privately about the service ever reaching 100 million paying subscribers. The report suggests Apple News+, Apple Fitness+ and Apple Arcade struggle, too. Apple Arcade reportedly had only 2 million users during its first year, with roughly 25% on free trials, while News+ purportedly has monthly active users in the “low single-digit millions.” (Other reports showed fast growth for Apple’s news aggregation service.) In addition, Apple Books and Apple News+ reportedly faced layoffs in 2024 due to weak performance. The reports revealed another interesting factor: Apple One bundles might mask the performance of individual services. Many subscribers apparently choose Apple One primarily for iCloud+ storage, not for the other included services. The report suggests that without Apple One, services like Apple Arcade and Fitness+ might fall short of profitability. But despite these challenges, Apple’s astronomical corporate profits easily absorb streaming service losses. Last quarter alone, Apple reported $124 billion in revenue with $36 billion in profit, putting the annual $1 billion Apple TV+ loss in perspective. As Severance concludes its critically acclaimed second season, the show’s success might help boost subscriber numbers beyond the reported 45 million. A recent Antenna report suggested Apple TV+ added 2 million new subscribers in a single month during this period. That substantial growth could help improve the service’s financial outlook. For Apple users invested in the company’s growing services ecosystem, the report highlights the challenges of building sustainable subscription services — even for one of the world’s most valuable companies. Apple TV+ is available by subscription for $9.99 with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. Customers who buy a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac or iPod touch can enjoy three months of Apple TV+ for free. After launching in November 2019, “Apple TV+ became the first all-original streaming service to launch around the world, and has premiered more original hits and received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service. To date, Apple Original films, documentaries and series have been honored with 471 wins and 2,090 award nominations and counting,” the service said. Apple TV+ is home to more than 200 exclusive movies and TV shows (including breakout soccer comedy Ted Lasso). The service also offers documentaries, dramas, comedies, kids shows and more.

Title: What Crypto to Buy as BlackRock Predicts Bitcoin Rally During US Recession
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/what-crypto-to-buy-as-blackrock-predicts-bitcoin-rally-during-us-recession/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T15:16:53Z

Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, spoke recently to Yahoo Finance, saying a recession would be a proper opportunity for Bitcoin to thrive. Mitchnick posited that while he is unsure a recession will happen, the economic conditions inherent in a recession would serve as a strong catalyst for Bitcoin’s growth. If so, what’s the best crypto to buy right now? Could exciting new projects like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), Meme Index Token ($MEMEX), and PancakeSwap ($CAKE) ride the crypto upswing to see some sensational returns? “If you look at bitcoin fundamentally on a long-term basis, it really seems like an asset that should be uncorrelated or even inversely correlated against certain risk factors that exist,” BlackRock global head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick. pic.twitter.com/9HvuxH30vi — Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) March 18, 2025 In the interview, Mitchnick broke down the typical catalysts for Bitcoin, all of which happen during a recession: If Mitchnick is right about a recession triggering Bitcoin’s rise, could this dip be just a temporary phase in a larger bull run? Other industry experts like Arthur Hayes co-founder of BitMEX, seem to think so. The plan: Be fucking patient. $BTC likely bottoms around $70k. 36% correction from $110k ATH, v normal for a bull market. Then we need stonks, $SPX and $NDX to enter free fall. Then we need TradFi muppet to go under. THEN we get Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ all easing to make… — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 11, 2025 Mitchnick’s views are also supported by Coinbase, which reported in its Monthly Outlook that investors should be prepared for a potential crypto market recovery in Q2, 2025, particularly if the US economy enters a recession. The recovering liquidity and reduced interest rates, combined with positive regulatory movements, create a positive environment for investment. If Michnick’s predictions are accurate, we can expect increased activity around other cryptocurrencies aside from $BTC, too. That’s why we’ve rounded up three of the best crypto to buy right now that have the potential to do well amidst a recession and a Bitcoin rally You hear the word ‘bull,’ and you think, strong, confident, large, and in charge, and that’s exactly what you get with Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Its primary focus is to get a shoulder to the wheel and push Bitcoin to $1M+. It’s still in presale, so early buyers can also earn an impressive 115% APY by staking. Need more incentives? No problem, BTC Bull Token comes with stacks. For example, if you hold your tokens in Best Wallet, you’ll get free $BTC airdrop rewards when Bitcoin reaches the $150K, $200K, and $250K milestones. The project team has also planned token burns at every $25k interval. These increase scarcity and thus value, helping bolster returns. If you’re anything like us, getting something for nothing is always a draw. And with offers like these, $BTCBULL is sure to continue to attract attention. And, with recession features being potential catalysts for Bitcoin, it might not be long before we see a bull run that gives early $BTCBULL investors a hefty return. Visit the official $BTCBull website now, or find out more in our How to Buy BTC Bull Token guide. Meme coins – exciting or daunting? If you lean to the latter, we may have something that could convert you – Meme Index ($MEMEX). Often, crazy crypto like meme coins can be perceived as too risky for cautious investors, but $MEMEX helps manage that risk through the good ol’ stock market trick of diversification. The first decentralized meme coin index, $MEMEX has four unique indexes, each containing a basket of meme coins assembled to your specific risk profile. This lets you spread your investment across a number of coins, simply by holding just the $MEMEX token. These include: Leveraging the indexes, all the leg work is taken out of meme coin investing – you choose the risk level you want and then sit back and let the index do the work for you. As a possible recession looms, $MEMEX could be your safest way to invest in some of the best meme coins today and profit even through the dips. Visit the official $MEMEX website for more. PancakeSwap Token ($CAKE) has shown periods of strong performance recently, indicating growing interest in the PancakeSwap platform. This, together with token burning, may have helped increase its value of late. Its current price is $2.417, up 47.78% in the last seven days. Could it keep this up if a recession becomes a reality? Also behind the token’s popularity is the fact holders get access to the PancakeSwap DEX, which is the dominant DEX on the BNB Chain. CoinGecko lists PancakeSwap in the top trading DEXs ranked by 24-hour trading volume. The platform has a healthy $1.9B+ Total Valued Locked (TVL). This indicates significant capital invested within the ecosystem, signifying a high degree of user trust and confidence. If a recession does indeed come to pass and Robbie Mitchnick is right about the correlation between recession markers and bullish Bitcoin performance, we should see a positive trend across the crypto market as a whole. Taking advantage of this and getting in early with exciting new crypto like $BTCBULL or $MEMEX could be a smart move, especially if a positive turn is imminent. Just a friendly reminder: we’re not financial advisors. Do your own research before investing in anything. Crypto is risky, so only put in what you’re comfortable potentially losing, as there are no guarantees of positive returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Top Altcoins to 100x as Trump to Speak at Digital Asset Summit Tonight
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/top-altcoins-to-100x-as-trump-to-speak-at-digital-asset-summit-tonight/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T14:54:33Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump will address the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) to be held in New York at North Javits on March 20, making him the first sitting US president to do so. There has been a lot of speculation on what Trump will say. Will he jack up his pro-crypto stance and make better legislative promises for the crypto industry? If yes, this could then be the perfect time to buy some of the top altcoins and meme coins. This speech comes almost a week after Trump signed an executive order to form a Bitcoin reserve, where the US government will slowly build a pool of $BTC over the years. Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich have also laid down proposals to acquire 1M Bitcoins in the next five years. Besides Trump’s historic keynote, Michael Saylor (executive chairman of MicroStrategy) will also address the summit and have a discussion with Pete Rizzo, a popular Bitcoin historian. There’ll also be extensive discussion on Bitcoin ETFs involving Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, and Giang Bui, Nasdaq’s head of U.S. equities & exchange-traded products. Ever since the appointment of Trump as the president, several pro-crypto decisions have been made. Several ETF applications, including those based on $LTC, $XRP and $DOGE, have been lodged. Plus, altcoins and meme coins received a much-needed push thanks to the launch of the $TRUMP token. And, of course, Bitcoin continued to remain crypto’s centerpiece with the launch of the new reserve. All in all, the time is just right to make some prudent crypto investments. If you’re also looking for potential digital asset investments, here are some cryptocurrencies you just cannot miss. A potential boost to crypto by Trump is likely to result in a Bitcoin rally. The OG crypto, which has been sideways for a while, could finally surge and break all recent resistance levels. If you want to ride Bitcoin’s growth but without spending a fortune, then BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is undoubtedly the best crypto to invest in. $BTCBULL token holders will receive free $BTC as and when Bitcoin crosses new milestones ($150K, $200K, $250K, and beyond) for the first time. Just make sure you buy and hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet to be eligible for the rewards. It’s also worth noting that $BTCBULL can generate exponentially higher returns than Bitcoin itself. Is BTC Bull Token, then, the next crypto to explode? Possibly. Grab one of the top trending cryptos for just $0.00242 per token. The project has so far amassed over $3.8M, which is proof of its promise. For more info, here’s a guide on how to buy BTC Bull Token. Solaxy ($SOLX) will build the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana. This makes it a unique (and potentially incredibly profitable) crypto, seeing as it has been designed for the betterment of the Solana blockchain. What’s aching Solana, you ask? The rapid rise of meme coins on the network has slowed it down significantly. It has been failing to accommodate the increased number of investors, and has, therefore, been throwing up congestion and scalability issues, including failed transactions. A multi-chain token, Solaxy plans to use a sidechain to process Solana’s transactions. This will reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet. Additionally, Solaxy will bundle multiple transactions into a single package, thereby offering investors lower fees, as well as faster execution and ease of use. The $SOLX presale is easily among the hottest crypto presales going around. With more than $27M in its presale purse at the time of writing, it’s currently offering one token for a low price of $0.001668. Here’s how to buy Solaxy. Although OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) has been under some serious selling pressure for the past few weeks, it’s up 1.28% today – and nearly 6% in the last seven days. As anticipation builds for the POTUS’ upcoming speech, $TRUMP could offer a great buying opportunity. It’s currently trading at $11.45. Experts believe the token is available at a huge discount and is, therefore, one of the best cheap altcoins to buy right now. The biggest reason for a bullish outlook on $TRUMP is Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. From his installing crypto-friendly personalities in top regulatory bodies like the SEC to his announcing a National Crypto Reserve, there’s no questioning Trump’s love for crypto. It’s also worth noting that $TRUMP has a short but promising history. Soon after its launch, it gained over 12,000% in just a few hours. An unprecedented interest from investors has made $TRUMP the fourth biggest crypto in the world. Currently, it has a market cap of over $2.2B. With the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) just hours away, we’d want our readers not to get carried away. FOMO is the killer of all portfolios, after all. Mix caution with aggression, which includes investing a small amount and diversifying your portfolio with multiple cryptos. Also, it’s crucial you do your own research before investing.

Title: Bitcoin To Align With Wall Street? BlackRock Predicts A Price Shift Ahead

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A BlackRock executive anticipates that the price of Bitcoin will increase in accordance with its growing institutional adoption. Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock chief of digital assets, stated that Bitcoin remains 15% above its early November levels, despite recent price declines. He raised this point during an interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. He believes that the cryptocurrency’s current value does not accurately reflect the number of significant institutions that are currently purchasing it. The market has not yet caught up to reality, he stated in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Mitchnick anticipates that the flagship crypto’s value will experience substantial growth once prices are in accordance with this institutional interest. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets says #Bitcoin’s Institutional adoption still isn’t reflected in the price. The new marketing team is here 🙌 pic.twitter.com/EZHP1uFYX5 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 19, 2025 United States President Donald Trump recently issued an executive order that established a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Numerous market observers anticipated that this would result in an instantaneous surge in crypto prices. In contrast, the cryptocurrency’s value has declined since the announcement. Mitchnick elucidated this discrepancy by asserting that individuals anticipated early substantial outcomes from these market developments. Premature expectations regarding the speed at which these favorable factors would influence prices were present, he stated. The BlackRock executive proposed that the market requires additional time to completely respond to these developments. Even as Bitcoin prices fluctuate, BlackRock has been exerting significant effort to encourage additional financial institutions and wealth managers to invest in its product. Mitchnick asserts that these endeavors are yielding results. Major financial institutions, such as Barclays, JPMorgan, and Avenir Group, now possess substantial quantities of BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT), which monitors Bitcoin’s price, according to recent filings. During the recent market uncertainty, Mitchnick attributed the lack of stability in Bitcoin to perception rather than actuality when asked why it has not been as stable as gold. He characterized Bitcoin’s recent association with risky assets as “self-inflicted,” a consequence of market observers’ persistent designation of it as a risk-on asset. His analysis indicates that Bitcoin’s fundamental characteristics should cause it to move in opposition to market risks, akin to gold. Meanwhile, Mitchnick disclosed that Bitcoin may actually benefit from a recession. He enumerated a number of economic downturns that are well-suited to Bitcoin’s characteristics, including increased government expenditure, reduced interest rates, stimulus money, and concerns regarding social stability.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Report: TV+ Losing $1 Billion Annually as Apple Services Falter

Time Published: 2025-03-20T13:59:10Z

Apple TV+ is hemorrhaging money amid a broader stall in Apple's services, according to a new report from The Information's Wayne Ma. The paywalled report reveals that ‌Apple TV‌+ is the only Apple subscription service that is not profitable. While its subscriptions grew to around 45 million last year, it is still losing more than $1 billion annually. The company has spent more than $5 billion a year on content since the service launched in 2019, but this was reduced by $500 million in 2024 in response to a push for cutbacks from Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Cook apparently raised questions last year about several movie deals with ‌Apple TV‌+ executives, including for the spy action-comedy film "Argylle." The movie stars Henry Cavill and Dua Lipa, and cost $200 million to produce. Cook reportedly complained that the movie had not found a significant audience or generated more subscribers for ‌Apple TV‌+. The report explains that "the audience for ‌Apple TV‌+ remains relatively small," constituting less than 1% of total U.S. streaming service viewing. Netflix and Amazon represented 8.2% and 3.5% of total viewing in February. Apple's initial business plan for ‌Apple TV‌+ predicted losses of between $15 billion and $20 billion over its first decade. While major losses are normal in the streaming industry, it represents a major departure for Apple which normally exercises fiscal discipline. Executives such as Eddy Cue initially shielded ‌Apple TV‌+ executives from budget scrutiny and rejected a proposal to increase oversight of programming costs. Apple did not have internal data on whether ‌Apple TV‌+ would tempt customers to buy Apple devices. Despite successes such as "CODA" winning an Oscar for best picture, Cook began closely scrutinizing ‌Apple TV‌+'s financial performance from 2022 and advocated more oversight. The use of private jet travel for stars at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars per flight came under particular scrutiny, and led Apple to ask executives to negotiate better deals with flight-chartering companies. Apple's overall corporate profits are so significant that it can easily absorb the losses from its streaming service, but it continues to forgo widespread appeal. Services is Apple's fastest and most profitable category, with gross margins exceeding 75%, compared to just under 40% for hardware. In its most recent fiscal year, services revenue rose 13% to more than $96 billion. However, other than iCloud+, Apple's other services are said to be in poor health. Apple Music's growth has reportedly virtually stopped and it remains "only marginally profitable." Since it pays artists and labels more than 70% of its revenues, it has a single-digit–percentage gross margin. Cue apparently told some colleagues privately that he doesn't believe the service will ever reach 100 million paying subscribers. Moreover, overall iTunes Store sales are now actively shrinking. Apple News+, Fitness+ and Apple Arcade are said to be struggling with low usage and profits. ‌Apple Arcade‌ only had two million users during its first year of operation, with roughly 25% of them on free trials. Similarly, ‌Apple News‌+ purportedly suffers with low engagement and the number of monthly active users is in the low single-digit millions. Apple Books and ‌Apple News‌+ was subject to layoffs in 2024 due to weak performance. Longtime Apple services executive Peter Stern, who oversaw platforms including ‌Apple TV‌+, abruptly departed the company in early 2023, claiming he was unable to run the streaming service in the way he needed to amid pressure to increase subscriber numbers. Apple subsequently reshuffled his former group, separating ‌Apple TV‌+, ‌Apple Music‌, and international content from News+, Fitness+, Apple Books, and ‌iCloud‌+. The report adds that most users do not sign up directly for Apple's services, instead opting for an Apple One bundle, which inflates the perceived interest in each service. Many who sign up to ‌Apple One‌ are motivated to subscribe so primarily because of ‌iCloud‌+ rather than other services. Without ‌Apple One‌, ‌Apple Arcade‌ and Apple Fitness+ would not be profitable. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/20/2025 6:52:22 AM PDT by MtnClimber Trump’s Blackrock deal is far from over. Generations of sending American jobs, tech, and manufacturing to China was equivalent to feeding wild tigers near the local kindergarten. And now jungles are full of tigers used to getting their way. I made the tiger photograph in the wilds of India. I made the video below in the wilds of Darien Gap. At an Embera village called Bajo Chiquito. Notice the Georgia Bulldogs tattoo. Maybe this guy is going to Georgia. And the man to his right. Wearing the cross. As many do. And the nice watch. After crossing through Darien Gap. Still has a nice watch. Darien robbers go through every speck of property including body cavity searches. If you lie and they find property after search, you die on the spot. Jungle law. Chinese do not get raped and robbed in Darien Gap because. They have a deal with the jungle. [short video at link] Many Chinese coming through have passports with false information. A perfect storm brews not just in Panama, but across the world. About 40 hours from now, Panama may be largely closed from massive protests over mostly internal matters such as social security benefits. I will be here. This is becoming far more dangerous and expensive.

Title: 'Job security is dead...': Viral post exposes grim future for Big Tech employees as firms slash jobs without rehiring

Feedback Recent layoffs in the IT sector are sending shockwaves through the industry, challenging long-held beliefs about job security in top tech firms. Driven by economic uncertainties, automation, and a push for efficiency, companies are aggressively cutting costs — often at the expense of their workforce. A viral Reddit post has further fueled discussions, shedding light on the harsh realities faced by professionals across Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. “Job security in Big Tech is a thing of the past,” the user wrote. “The days when working for top tech companies meant long-term stability are over. AI is reshaping the workforce, making several roles redundant, and mid-career professionals are particularly vulnerable. People in their late 30s and early 40s are at a crossroads—too senior for entry-level jobs but not yet in executive roles.” The post also highlighted the growing trend of companies eliminating roles permanently, with no intention of rehiring. “Amazon’s workforce reductions are more aggressive than before. While the company used to trim around 7-8% of employees annually due to performance reviews, that number has now surged into double digits. Layoffs are being carried out with ruthless efficiency, with little regard for employee well-being.” While global tech hubs like London, Silicon Valley, and Dubai face severe slowdowns, the post noted that India's job market appears slightly more stable. However, the broader outlook remains grim, with professionals around the world struggling to find employment amid an oversaturated job market. The discussion sparked widespread engagement, with users sharing their own experiences. “Finding a job has become significantly harder worldwide over the past 1.5 to 2 years,” one commenter noted. “Companies overhired after the pandemic, and now the market is flooded with job seekers. Even senior professionals struggle for months to secure employment.” AI’s role in job displacement was another major concern. “I would estimate AI makes me 30% more efficient. A better engineer could get to 100% efficiency increase. That means fewer jobs. If you have four people on a team and three become significantly more productive, you can pretty much fire the fourth,” another user wrote. Beyond AI, outsourcing is emerging as a key disruptor. “A bigger immediate threat than AI or work visas is offshoring. Companies are sending entry-level IT jobs to Latin America and India, eliminating opportunities for new graduates. Even mid-tier roles are being offshored, making it harder to climb the career ladder,” one commenter warned. Copyright©2025 Living Media India Limited.

Title: Tokenization Revolution: Transforming Global Finance And Challenges Ahead
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chris-perry/2025/03/20/tokenization-revolution-transforming-global-finance-and-challenges-ahead/

ByChris Perry ByChris Perry , Contributor. There is a revolution in tokenization of digital assets. Is your business onboard? Imagine a world where financial transactions occur instantly, assets traverse the globe with seamless efficiency, and every investor, regardless of stature, gains unfettered access to markets with confidence in the identity of their counterparty, previously out of reach. This is not a distant fantasy but a rapidly emerging reality, spearheaded by the projection that $30 trillion worth of assets could be tokenized by 2030. Across the banking spectrum, behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank are paving the way with the tokenization of deposits. They are introducing proprietary stablecoins to fortify settlement processes and alleviate the complexities associated with foreign exchange. By implementing these technologies, these banks have successfully dispelled doubts regarding blockchain's scalability and streamlined operations, delivering significant new value to clients. Fintech leaders are also at the forefront of the tokenization movement. For example, my firm, Broadridge, launched a revolutionary platform for the repo market last year. The platform enhances liquidity through tokenizing repurchase agreements, facilitating an average of $2 trillion in on-chain transactions every month. These innovations reduce settlement times and bolster liquidity, illustrating the transformative potential of blockchain technology. In the realm of asset management, industry trailblazers such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree are venturing into on-chain infrastructures for specific money markets and mutual funds. This paradigm shift is reminiscent of the success experienced with bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds this year, generating palpable market excitement and robust growth prospects. It's conceivable that trillions of dollars could soon flow through this novel infrastructure, amplifying efficiency and accessibility in financial markets. Tokenization isn’t confined to conventional finance; it extends its reach into alternative assets, ranging from real estate and private credit to artwork and private placements. Private equity titans like KKR and Hamilton Lane are redefining accessibility by issuing tokenized on-chain private equity funds, drastically lowering investment minimums. This new approach opens traditionally exclusive markets to a broader pool of retail investors, enhancing liquidity and fostering market democratization. Tokenization's influence is palpable even beyond the financial realm. For instance, California recently initiated a program to tokenize the titles of over 50 million registered cars, enabling owners to transfer ownership in one seamless step. Initiatives like these highlight the broader applicability and transformative potential of tokenization across various sectors. As these technologies continue reshaping global finance, collaboration with regulators will be pivotal. Digital assets are not necessarily like traditional assets. Sometimes there is no “issuer” on the hook for providing reliable information about the asset. Product developers, solution providers and regulators must work together to find ways to ensure investors access to comprehensive, standardized information about digital to be better informed. Creating safeguards like this will be essential to protect investors and markets as this transformation unfolds. The question is not whether this financial evolution will happen—it's already underway—but rather how we, as global stakeholders, can guide it responsibly and beneficially. For example, the tokenized future will not be confined to regional exchanges; instead, it will thrive on global platforms enabled by decentralized models offering real-time settlement at a fraction of traditional costs. The opportunity for policymakers to craft regulations that marry innovation with protection is immense, ensuring the market evolves in sync with technological advancements. The decisions made today by policymakers and industry leaders will indelibly shape how this transformation unfolds and ultimately benefit future generations of investors. The stakes are high and the call to action is clear: Embrace innovation while implementing robust regulatory frameworks that protect investor interests and aid in global financial growth. As the blockchain technology underpinning this revolution continues to bridge the gap between traditional and modern financial systems, the responsibility is on us to shepherd this transformation responsibly, ensuring greater choice for investors, greater efficiencies in raising capital and greater transparency in financial markets. The future of finance is being built before our eyes. The mission for global stakeholders—comprising regulators, innovators and investors—is to steer this evolution toward a future that is equitable and accessible, reflecting the best of what the tokenization revolution can offer. As we navigate this new frontier, the fusion of strategic vision and thoughtful governance will determine its success, charting a course for a financial landscape that thrives on innovation and provides investors with even greater choices.

Title: "Don't Celebrate Too Early": Thyrocare Founder On Amazon's Mass Layoff Plan

Thyrocare founder Dr A Velumani recently took to X to highlight the emotional impact of mass layoffs, particularly in tech companies like Amazon, Meta and Google. In his post, Mr Velumani reflected on how many individuals celebrate securing jobs with major brands, only to face unexpected job losses later. His post came in response to reports that Amazon is planning to lay off 14,000 employees to save $3.5 billion per year in costs. "Imagine how many might have celebrated for getting a campus placement with such brands. Now how many might feel depressed! It is not 10 or 20. 100 or 200. 1000 or 2000. 14000. Do not celebrate too early. Career or business - It's Marathon Race," the Thyrocare founder wrote.

Career or business - It's Marathon Race. pic.twitter.com/rrcQujB7hN Mr Velumani's post quickly caught the internet's attention. It sparked a discussion online, with many users emphasising the importance of adaptability in today's job market. While some users said that job security is a myth, others compared career growth to a marathon rather than a sprint. "Job security is a myth. Skills, adaptability, and financial planning matter more than titles," wrote one user. "Reminds me of the funda that never get too comfortable too soon. Whether career or business, it's a marathon, not a sprint. Stay adaptable, keep growing," commented another. Also Read | Finland Is World's Happiest Country For 8th Year Straight, India Stands At... "In other way, don't give-up early, its a marathon race. Situations may change anytime," remarked a third user. "A job is a sprint, but wealth-building is a marathon. Markets, careers, and businesses have cycles-ups and downs are inevitable. Invest like you build a career-steady, patient, and focused on the long run. Survival isn't about speed; it's about endurance," explained another. "Everything has a shelf life like a product. Human beings needs to evolve from being commodity to VA product. Orgs have to save their ass when times are bad. Learn this at young age," one user said. "As Kalam sir said no need to be loyal to the company be loyal to your work," expressed another.

Stocks changed direction and rose after existing-home sales unexpectedly picked up in February to an annualized rate of 4.26 million. Weekly jobless claims didn’t increase by as much as expected, and the Philadelphia Fed index dropped by less than estimated, to 12.5 in March from 18.1 last month. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all advanced. Here are some stocks to watch today: Accenture’s (ACN+0.90%) shares fell 9.8% after the consulting firm said the Trump Administration is delaying and canceling new contracts amid its push to cut government spending. Darden Restaurants’ (DRI+0.05%) stock jumped 6.9% as investors remained confident in the company’s prospects despite fiscal third-quarter numbers that missed expectations by some measures. Same-store sales growth of 0.7% fell short of the consensus estimate of 1.7%, as Olive Garden and LongHorn SteakHouse both missed expectations. FedEx (FDX-6.40%) stock gained about 0.5%. The delivery service is scheduled to report earnings after the close today. Both earnings per share and revenue are expected to increase year over year, according to a Zacks consensus estimate. Micron’s shares (MU-7.79%) gained 1.8%. The chipmaker is scheduled to report quarterly earnings after the market closes today, with analysts estimate that per-share earnings and revenue will be in the middle of the forecast range. Nike’s (NKE-5.48%) stock edged higher. The shoemaker is scheduled to publish quarterly earnings after the market closes today. Bank of America (BAC+0.06%) analysts said the results matter less than the company’s message about its product reset and evidence its new offerings are resonating with consumers. Nvidia (NVDA-1.11%) will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on chips and other electronics manufactured in the U.S. over the next four years, out of about $500 billion of total electronics procurement, CEO Jensen Huang told the FT. The stock gained 0.8%. QXO’s shares gained about 4% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the building products distributor had reached an agreement to buy Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN-0.05%) for $124.35 a share. Beacon gained 1.9% to $123.83.

Title: Gold Surges, Bitcoin Rallies, Stocks Down Since Trump's Electoral Win — What’s Driving the Chaos?

Pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election over four months ago, and since then, the period has been characterized by financial market turbulence and global uncertainties surrounding tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged over 23% since the Nov. 5 election, reaching an all-time high of over $109K at the end of January. Despite a subsequent 30% decline from its peak, it remains one of the best-performing assets. Strategy (MSTR), often considered a bitcoin proxy, has gained 34%, recovering well under the Trump administration despite previously dropping around 60% from its November highs. Ethereum's ether token (ETH) has fallen by as much as 18%, alongside disappointing action in the broader crypto market. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining ETF has also struggled, dropping almost 30%. Meanwhile, investors have rotated money into BTC, pushing its dominance rate higher by 2% to over 61. European equities have done well, outshining their U.S. counterparts. The German DAX index is up 20%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 has gained 6%, alongside weaker performances in the U.S. stock market, where the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both down approximately 2%. A recent report from Bank of America highlights a record drop in U.S. stock allocations. Gold, benefiting from uncertainty, has continued to set new all-time highs, surpassing $3,030—an 11% increase. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of major currencies, remains flat. However, under Trump, the dollar has weakened significantly, providing some relief to risk assets and major currencies such as the Euro and the Great British Pound. Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has slightly declined to 4.2%, a key metric the administration is closely monitoring. Oil prices have plummeted by around 7% as the U.S. maintains its stance on energy dominance to reduce energy costs. Notably, some of the so-called "Magnificent 7" stocks have struggled, with NVIDIA (NVDA) down 16% and Tesla (TSLA) declining 6%. Recent losses on Wall Street and in the crypto market have ignited hopes for the "Trump put," or potential policy support. However, the administration appears willing to endure short-term pain for long-term benefits, believing that this approach will cleanse the markets of the fiscal spending excesses of the Biden era. This reset is expected to be characterized lower inflation, improved energy security, and a lower 10-year Treasury yield. "Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain—that’s the strategy," Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, said in an email to CoinDesk this week. "Regardless, I don't see BTC falling below 70k, possibly 73-78k which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think," Chen added.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd., has reached a preliminary agreement with Allianz SE to form an insurance business in India, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes as the German insurer agreed earlier this week to sell its stake in joint ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd. Both Jio and Allianz are in the process of finalizing the ownership structure, said the people who asked not to be identified as the matter is confidential. Allianz is aiming for a majority stake, but if that is not feasible, it is open to securinggovernance rights with a path to taking control in the future, according to one of the people. Jio and Allianz are seeking a tie-up for both health and general insurance. The agreement has yet to be finalized and is subject to change.

Jio Financial, helmed by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, runs a shadow bank and has joined forces with BlackRock Inc. A foray in the insurance sector will help the Ambani unit in its quest to become a financial services behemoth. India’s insurance penetration — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — at 3.7%, is well below Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea and Thailand, according to data from the local insurance regulator.

Title: Nvidia plans large-scale investment in US chip manufacturing over four years

Nvidia is reportedly planning a significant investment in semiconductor production and electronic components within the US. Over the next four years, total spending is expected to reach approximately $500bn, according to reporting by the Financial Times. Huang, in an interview with the publication, indicated that a substantial portion of this investment could be directed towards domestic chip production. He suggested that the Trump administration may play a role in accelerating the growth of the AI industry in the US by supporting manufacturing initiatives. Nvidia has been addressing investor concerns about continued demand for its high-cost AI chips, particularly amid increased competition. This follows the launch of a chatbot by China’s DeepSeek, which reportedly operates with fewer AI chips, raising questions about potential shifts in the AI hardware market. Huang has confirmed that Nvidia’s latest AI systems can now be manufactured in the US through partnerships with major suppliers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Foxconn. He noted that TSMC’s investment in US-based manufacturing represents a significant step towards strengthening supply chain resilience, reducing dependency on overseas production, and ensuring steady access to critical semiconductor components. The company’s expansion strategy comes at a time of heightened global competition in the AI sector, particularly from Chinese technology firms. Nvidia has acknowledged Huawei’s growing influence in the market, underscoring the need for continuous investment in advanced chip production and infrastructure to maintain its leadership position. At the company’s developer conference in California on Wednesday, Huang told analysts that demand for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips could be significantly higher than current projections. He noted that orders for 3.6 million units from four major cloud firms underestimated overall market demand, as they did not account for purchases from Meta Platforms, smaller cloud providers, or AI-focused startups. Beyond manufacturing, Nvidia is expanding its role in AI infrastructure development through its participation in the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP). The consortium, which includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft, and MGX, aims to drive investment in AI-ready data centres and energy infrastructure. Initially, AIP plans to unlock $30bn in capital, with total investment potential reaching $100bn when including debt financing. Nvidia will continue to serve as a technical advisor to AIP, leveraging its expertise in AI computing and data centre infrastructure. The initiative is expected to foster collaboration across a diverse network of investors, corporations, and technology firms, focusing on scalable AI solutions. AIP’s investments will be primarily directed toward the US and partner countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Last month, Nvidia forecasted revenue of approximately $43bn for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, surpassing market expectations. The company expects gross margins to be around 70.6%, with operating expenses estimated at $5.2bn on a GAAP basis. It also anticipates additional income of approximately $400m, excluding gains and losses from equity securities. Give your business an edge with our leading Tech Monitor

CVC Capital Partners Plc has identified private credit in the US as an area for potential acquisitions, according to Chief Executive Officer Rob Lucas. There are “huge opportunities” for CVC in private wealth and insurance business, Lucas said during a media call on Thursday after the company posted its full-year earnings . “We have consistently said that if the right opportunity to build our business inorganically, arises, then we are very open to that and we will look carefully at those opportunities,” Lucas said. “We have in the past identified US private credit as as one of those areas.” Bloomberg News reported this week that CVC is interested in acquiring Fortress Investment Corp. and has held talks with Fortress and majority owner, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co., though discussions aren’t active at the moment. CVC had also expressed interest in a potential combination with HPS Investment Partners before BlackRock Inc. agreed to buy HPS in a $12 billion all-stock deal in December. Insurance business is another focus of growth for CVC, which has raised more than €15 billion of capital from insurance clients over the past five years. Insurers are keen to tie up with private markets operators to help manage the assets on their balance sheets, according to Fred Watt, CVC’s chief financial officer. “It’s something we look at,” Watt said. “We’re well placed to do that and we can see why insurance companies are interested in in that sort of arrangement.” Market Dislocation CVC made €1.33 billion in management fees last year, beating analyst estimates of €1.23 billion, its latest earnings showed. Its assets under management totaled €200 billion at the end of 2024. The private equity firm said it has €40 billion of capital available to deploy across all its strategies. It expects “strong growth” in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2025. Shares of CVC rose as much as 4.8% Thursday, the most since Dec. 12. The stock has fallen about 7% this year, giving the company a market value of around €21 billion. Recent market volatility and geopolitical concerns have sapped dealmaking activity globally. Initial public offerings have slowed as well. The private equity owners of Stada Arzneimittel AG have decided to push back the German drugmaker’s IPO until September, Bloomberg News reported this week. German regional lender Oldenburgische Landesbank AG has abandoned plans for an IPO and will instead be sold to a subsidiary of France’s Crédit Mutuel Alliance Fédérale. CVC, however, views volatility as an opportunity, according to Lucas. “We thrive in periods of change,” he said. ‘The last time, we saw something like this, I suppose would be in the market dislocations post the global financial crisis,” CVC’s Watt added. “I can think of many examples in those periods where we were one of the few buyers of assets. And we can see that happening as we speak.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: Managers Have Won the War on Remote Work. Now Where Does Everybody Sit?

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. In 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic, the global advertising conglomerate WPP started to slash almost one-third of its New York office space. Different WPP agencies maintained separate Manhattan headquarters: Ogilvy was on 11th Avenue, Grey on lower Fifth, VML in Columbus Circle. But those buildings were all empty, and there was no telling when or if the thousands of employees who had once worked in them would return. WPP’s corporate leadership had long been trying to break down the walls between its subsidiaries by putting them together on corporate campuses, and a five-year strategic plan, developed with the consultants at McKinsey & Company and announced in late 2020, estimated it could reduce its global real-estate costs by consolidating offices. “COVID really supports the space agenda we’ve had for years,” the executive who then managed WPP’s American real estate told a New York trade publication in December 2020. “People don’t need a desk just to put pictures on it.” Remote work appeared, at first, to be that rare thing in corporate America: an efficiency measure that made both management and employees happy. Mark Read, WPP’s chief executive, says it “amazed everybody” to discover the business of advertising could be done from home. Based on preliminary evidence, both sides made permanent decisions. Some workers bought houses far outside the city, or left the New York area completely. WPP gradually moved most of its New York agencies into an airy “vertical campus” occupying 13 stories in 3 World Trade Center, which it had originally opened in 2018 as a headquarters for two of its firms. They would all have less space but more flexibility. The company’s “hybrid work” policy gave employees latitude to come in rarely, or not at all. By last year, though, Read says he came to believe that remote work was no longer working. “I just don’t believe you can do our job on the end of a video screen,” Read says. “I think people’s attention wanes, and they’re not fully present.” When he visited WPP’s offices around the world, he perceived that “those offices that were doing best were also those offices that were the busiest.” When he examined the data, he says he saw that in-person attendance appeared to correlate with employee satisfaction, as measured by internal survey results, and also financial performance. But attendance varied across the more than 100 companies that WPP owns. “The challenge was that without a mandate, it was very hard,” Read says. “People weren’t coming in, and if people weren’t coming in, people didn’t see the benefit of being together.” Read’s realization came at a moment of atmospheric change in office culture. For the first few years after the pandemic, a period of fast economic recovery and labor scarcity, workers had leverage to demand a great deal from their employers. Companies pledged to respect work-life balance, personal growth, and mental wellness, and offered perks like online meditation sessions. They also liberated workers from the bonds of the office. Some bosses embraced remote work wholeheartedly as a transformational (and economical) change; others allowed it grudgingly, issuing unenforced attendance guidelines and turning a blind eye to Zoom backgrounds. Across sectors, though, CEOs are now getting tough and reclaiming their authority by imposing mandatory return-to-office policies. At WPP, the summons came down in a January memo entitled “Winning Together,” in which Read extolled the intangible benefits of “human connection, creativity, and relationships,” before laying down the new law to his more than 100,000 employees worldwide: Come in at least four days a week, starting in April. “The initial response was quite polarizing,” Read says, with considerable understatement. Decrying the “mental and social effects” of “rigid work regimes,” a group of WPP employees started an online petition, which has collected more than 20,000 signatures. “I’ve yet to speak to a single colleague who is happy with the four-day return-to-office,” one executive told the marketing industry website the Drum. Another said: “It has left us reeling.” A similar dynamic has played out in workplaces across New York City: at banks, at media organizations, and even at formerly footloose tech firms. In January, JP Morgan and Amazon announced or implemented five-day return-to-office policies, putting an end to the remote-work experiment. The law firm Sullivan & Cromwell reportedly instructed its associates to be in the office from at least 9:30 to 5:30, Monday through Friday. Companies large and small have been quietly upping the number of days they require their employees to be in — a phenomenon known as “RTO creep.” RTO creep is reflected in a variety of statistical measures of the city’s business — and busyness. The Real Estate Board of New York’s monthly office-visitation report, which draws on mobile-device tracking data, hit a post-pandemic high last December, surpassing 80 percent of what it was in 2019 if you exclude the final holiday week. New Jersey Transit reports that its regional rail-system ridership is about 75 percent of what it was before COVID, with peak midweek trains carrying as many passengers as before. The MTA’s commuter trains report comparable ridership figures. For the past few months, office leasing activity has been as consistently strong as New York has seen since the pandemic-era commercial real-estate crash. Beyond the numbers, you can see evidence of RTO creep in the desultory line at the salad bar, the quiet that has descended on the gym on a Monday morning, and an uptick in desperate group-chat pleas for after-school carpools. Office work is not all the way back to what it once was, but the trend is moving in one direction with disorienting speed, without much regard for life or balance. The most extreme return-to-office mandates can, in some cases, leave employees with less permission to work from home than they enjoyed before the pandemic. Tonally, if the first half of the 2020s brought out the human side of human resources, the back end may belong to Elon Musk, the billionaire and return-to-office zealot who has used mandates as a blunt instrument to purge workforces, first at Twitter and now within the federal bureaucracy. C-suite executives, unleashing their inner Elons, are feeling emboldened to bark: Get back to work! And they are sending messages that they really mean it this time, letting their employees know they are keeping track of turnstile badge swipes and using other surveillance measures to track compliance. Workers can complain — and they do, loudly — but the hard truth is, they have little room to resist the reversal. Now that the job market has cooled and a recession is looming, power has shifted back to employers, who are showing who’s boss. Like all utopian experiments, work-from-anywhere was never as universally beneficial as advertised. The phenomenon was terrible for New York City, which lost tax revenue, small businesses, and tens of thousands of residents it has yet to recover. Many of the city’s top executives were quick to return to work in person after the lockdown, and were confronted each day with the sight of many empty desks. “We have a lot of space,” says Brad Karp, the chair of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, which rents 675,000 square feet in a skyscraper on Sixth Avenue and resisted incentives to downsize. “When it was unoccupied during COVID, it was very, very jarring.” In February, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, gave voice to the long-festering frustration of many of his peers. At a company town hall at a satellite office in Ohio, a JP Morgan IT worker asked Dimon if he might allow managers some flexibility to make exceptions to his new five-day office mandate. “I’m going to give you a complete answer,” Dimon replied. “There is no chance that I would leave that up to managers. Zero chance. The abuse that took place was extraordinary.” Then Dimon let loose a profane rant. “We also had — and you know I’m right about this one — a lot of you were on the fucking Zoom and you were doing the following: looking at your mail, sending texts to each other about what an asshole the other person is, not paying attention, not reading your stuff, and if you don’t think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness — it does.” Dimon railed against unofficial three-day weekends — “I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there’s not a goddamn person you can get ahold of” — and said that anyone who disagreed with his new policy could find other employment. “You don’t have to work at JPMorgan,” Dimon said. “It’s a free country, you can walk with your feet. But this company is going to set our own standards and do it our own way. I’ve had it with this kind of stuff. I’ve been working seven days a goddamn week since COVID, and I come in, and — where is everybody else?” Audio of Dimon’s tirade went viral, inspiring a predictable uproar on social media and secret delight among the many bosses who shared his cynical assumptions about what their subordinates really were up to on their remote days. David Solomon, Dimon’s counterpart at Goldman Sachs, liked to tell the story of the time he ran into a group of junior bankers lunching at a Hamptons restaurant one COVID summer workday, at a time when Goldman’s offices were mostly closed for social distancing. Goldman was one of the first New York companies to summon employees back in 2021, overriding work-life balance complaints from its younger employees. Even a notoriously demanding boss like Solomon, however, has run into problems enforcing his mandate, forcing the bank to periodically circulate unfriendly reminders to its staff. It’s a common issue: A 2024 office-tenant survey by the commercial real-estate firm CBRE found that only 17 percent of organizations have a policy that they actively enforce. Inconsistency in both expectations and compliance has created an uneven state of affairs in New York. Firms in some industries, like finance and real estate, issued RTO edicts years ago, and are now more or less back to their pre-pandemic routines. (Even before Dimon’s mandate, around 70 percent of JP Morgan employees were coming in five days.) In the realm of big law, attitudes surrounding office work were slower to revert and still vary from firm to firm, in part because they were run by committees of partners, some of whom have very much enjoyed their independence. (A recent survey of more than 1,000 law firm partners conducted by the BTI Consulting Group found that 50 percent were adamantly opposed to return-to-office mandates.) Creative sectors that embraced the work-from-anywhere ethos, like software design, media, and advertising, have been slowest to junk the hybrid model. Some in this realm, like the book publisher Random House and Vox Media — this publication’s parent company — still have no uniform company-wide attendance requirement. But increasingly, they are outliers. The Atlantic told its staff in January that they would soon be required to be in the office three days a week. The magazine company Condé Nast imposed a four-day office mandate that took effect earlier this month. The Washington Post has ordered its reporters to be back in the newsroom five days a week in June. Remote workers will often say they find they get more done at home. “I don’t think personal productivity is the only metric of success in our business,” Read replies. “How many emails you answer, how many Teams calls you do — business is more than that. It is also mentoring, training, coaching, motivating, and all those things are much easier to do, and in some cases you can only do them, if you are together.” Managers are also aware that some percentage of their employees abused their lack of supervision. Some took on side gigs. Some just checked out. Ironically, autonomy also seemed to make workers more discontented. Vanessa Akhtar, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter who specializes in workplace performance, says that many companies have been alarmed to see scores on their internal workplace engagement surveys plummet, with respondents indicating they are isolated and mistrustful of leadership. Forcing employees to return to offices, she says, “is one way to almost coerce personal engagement.” “I believe it is nearly impossible to develop a culture remotely,” says Karp, who announced a four-day-a-week policy for Paul Weiss in early March. Other big law firms — Skadden, Weil Gotshal, Davis Polk, Vinson & Elkins — have implemented similar four-day mandates, and each time it’s happened, the industry website Above the Law has published a post in which anonymous tipsters bitch about the decision. “Associates are furious, many are looking into quitting,” one source at Sullivan & Cromwell told the blog after news leaked on Reddit that the firm was now requiring junior attorneys to be in five days a week, absent extraordinary circumstances. But Karp says that, in the case of Paul Weiss, his push to return to an office was supported by a committee of the firm’s associates, who recognized that interaction with their superiors created more opportunities for mentorship and advancement. For that to occur, senior people also have to be present. “It really only works effectively if the partners are there,” Karp says. And that is why a universal mandate was necessary. In the first years after the pandemic, anecdotal evidence suggested there was a generational gap in attitudes about the necessity of the office, with younger workers taking the fullest advantage of the freedom of remote work. If anything, employers now say, that dynamic has reversed. Zoomers who had little previous experience of the office have realized it is easier to be recognized for your work if your boss recognizes your face. “It was clear that the people who weren’t coming in were not advancing,” says the managing partner of a large New York architecture firm. “As promotions came through, I think they saw that the people who were there were more successful.” Now the people who are more resistant to recalibrating their routines, in this manager’s experience, were the mid-career employees. “People with smaller kids, that’s where it’s tricky.” Bosses recognize that many of their employees — particularly ones with families — rebuilt their lives around the expectation that they would be able to continue working remotely. Those who bought houses far outside the city are now looking at long daily commutes. Those who got used to being able to schedule their work around their kids’ school days and sports practices are now having to think about finding expensive child care. In prior years, they might have been able to keep telecommuting on the down-low, hoping that management wasn’t really serious, but the newest mandates have often come accompanied by a draconian message to holdouts: Conform or quit. Akhtar says that while most employers are not trying to inspire mass attrition, à la Musk, they are aware that presenting a return-to-office ultimatum may cause some employees to consider resignation. In certain circumstances, she says, they may desire such self-selecting attrition. “I’ve had employers be honest and say, ‘Yes that is part of it,’” Akhtar told me. Forcing employees to recommit to coming to work at the office on a daily basis, she says, gives management ”an opportunity to see who is onboard.” To many people who returned to the office voluntarily years ago, such demands can seem insulting. Office workers grew accustomed to thinking that they were adults who could be trusted to choose where they could perform best on any given day. When they feel like management is treating them like children, Akhtar said, they are apt to rebel. Even in typically conformist workplaces like JPMorgan and Amazon, the new mandates have inspired Slack uprisings, murmurs of unionization and disobedience. Employees in some heavy-handed companies have devised sneaky ways to work around the system, for instance by swiping into the office, getting themselves a free coffee, and heading home. (This strategy is so common that management consultants have coined a name for it: “coffee badging.”) A couple weeks ago, on Reddit, a person posting under the username No-Refrigerator7245, who said they were a New York–based WPP remote worker, asked for feedback about whether they could stay “under the radar” and avoid consequences. (A leaked WPP internal memo advised that noncompliance could result in “disciplinary action up to and including termination.”) The question sparked a vigorous discussion about corporate surveillance in the advertising industry. A commenter who said they worked at another ad company, one of WPP’s competitors, reported there was gossip that the company pinged its employees’ VPNs three times a day to confirm their locations. Another commenter noted what happened last year at Publicis, another competitor, which reportedly fired nearly 100 employees in the U.S. for “egregious” noncompliance with its three-day office policy. “Yep, they’ll fire OP in a heartbeat,” another commenter concluded, referring to the original poster. “At this point the industry is in shambles so better to suck it up and comply than to rock the boat.” The discussion took note of WPP’s disappointing recent financial performance; its stock is down by more than 25 percent since early December. Last year, at a conference on remote work held at Stanford University, a pair of business-school researchers from the University of Pittsburgh presented a paper that drew a connection between return-to-office mandates and poor financial results, finding that in the case of many companies — UPS, Amazon, Boeing, Nike — policies were toughened immediately after stock-price crashes. The professors hypothesized the outcome was consistent with management deciding to “reassert control over employees,” blaming them as “a scapegoat for bad firm performance.” It makes intuitive sense: Bosses get stressed and they punish their lazy workers. On the other hand, those bosses might reply, bad financial performance might be a sign that flexible policies are not as productive as workers may think. That was the message that Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, recently sent to the Silicon Valley engineers assigned to work on Gemini, its artificial-intelligence product. “I recommend being in the office at least every weekday,” Brin told his employees in a memo that was promptly leaked to the Times. A 60-hour work week, he suggested, was “the sweet spot of productivity.” Brin is probably not wrong to think that, as his search-engine business faces an existential competitive threat from AI start-ups, his coders ought to be working overtime. (Google’s thousands of employees in New York are only required to be in the office three days a week.) A similar catchup effort has been playing out at Rockstar Games. It called its employees back five days a week last year, Bloomberg reported, as it labored to finish the development of Grand Theft Auto VI, which has been hampered by footage leaks and delays. The fact that these mandates are coming down in the tech industry just shows how much the workplace conversation has shifted. You can’t blame workers for feeling whipsawed. Even Zoom now mandates that employees who live within 50 miles of one its offices come in at least two days a week. Last December, just before a round of layoffs, Condé Nast chief executive Roger Lynch announced a new four-day office mandate to his remaining employees. Staffers wondered: Working where? Inside Condé’s offices at One World Trade Center, unassigned “hot desks” were already in short supply. Lynch’s memo promised there would soon be “more information on space,” but satisfying explanations never came. In February, as the mandate loomed, the Condé Nast union staged an unusual labor action. Instead of striking, magazine staffers came to work simultaneously, to demonstrate how cramped they would be. “We wait in line for phone pods,” the union posted on X. “We hold meetings while Avicii blasts over the speakers & people eat sandwiches in the background of our Zooms.” An accompanying photo displayed a group of young workers, laptops open, sitting five to a booth in the cafeteria. While it did not exactly resemble a coal mine, the scene did foreshadow the unproductive discomfort that Condé’s clumsily implemented policy would inflict when it started in March. “It’s just a shitshow,” says one employee, who described a weeks-long competition for scarce desks. “Everyone is miffed, even the top brass.” The annoyance of overcrowding has been exacerbated by the unforgiving rigidity of the policy. In briefings given by human resources, managers were told that employees were required to be present Monday through Thursday. It didn’t count if you worked from home because your child had a fever, or you were getting a cough that might be something worse — you would have to take one of your ten allotted remote work days per year, or else call in sick. Working on a Friday also didn’t count toward your four-day requirement, which was maddening to employees who had to work in the office on Fridays, doing things like finishing up a magazine that has to go to the printer. Upper management let it be known that it was tracking badge swipes. A briefing slide titled “Non-Compliance With Policy,” illustrated with a stock photo of a pair of very serious looking models, indicated there were two options for dealing with truants: • Voluntary Resignation• Involuntary Separation To some employees, it all seemed very reminiscent of the chainsaw-wielding tactics of Musk. “Overall, we see the RTO push as a way to coerce members to quit without severance,” says Jess Lane, an organizer of the Condé Nast union protest. “This is another way of culling the herd.” The space constraints Condé Nast’s employees were feeling were the product of management’s previous cost-saving decisions. As the magazine business contracted, so had its office space inside One World Trade Center. Publications like The New Yorker and Vanity Fair were forced to downsize their space. At one point in 2021, Condé’s ownership stopped paying rent to its landlord in an unsuccessful attempt to spring itself from its decades-long lease in the building. The two sides settled their dispute, but Conde has continued to attempt to unload space on the sublease market. At least five of its floors that it leases are currently listed as available to sublet, according to the CoStar Group’s commercial real-estate data. Lane says that in response to the overcrowding issue, Condé Nast recently moved some workers to the building’s 27th floor, which was one of the spaces it had been trying to sublease. Many companies took an opportunistic approach to their office space during the pandemic, reducing their square footage when their leases came up for renegotiation or subleasing unused floors. Now, that tide of vacancy is starting to roll back in. According to figures from CBRE, since the beginning of last year, around 3 million square feet has been taken off the sublease market by companies that say they plan to reoccupy it. Shifting to hybrid or all-remote work policies not only saved on rent, it also allowed companies to quickly expand their workforces, because they were no longer limited by geography when it came to hiring talent. It has turned out, though, that dispersal creates its own limits. Altruist, a financial technology company founded in 2018, used a work-from-home policy to quickly staff up by hiring people all over the country, only to decide as it grew more established that it needed offices for managerial and regulatory reasons. “All we knew is that the longer we waited, the more difficult this would be,” says Katherine Starros, the company’s head of human resources. In 2023, after health concerns related to COVID relaxed, it told its employees they would have to work in an office in Dallas or Los Angeles, and gave them around six months to relocate within commuting distance, if necessary. Starros said 13 percent of its 250 employees quit, a little less than the opt-out rate the company expected. Altruist has since filled all those positions and more. It is expanding its two offices and has opened an outpost in San Francisco. A New York location is also in the works. “We are really excited about our first ever real internship program this summer,” Starros said. In some cases, corporate decisions made based on the presumption of continuing low office attendance have had expensive consequences. During the pandemic, some New York office tenants decided to make an upgrade in quality, vacating their old buildings when their leases expired and taking smaller but pricier office space in new construction in developments like One Vanderbilt or at Hudson Yards. “Some companies that did that transaction — less space, higher rent — thought they could shimmy down,” says Peter Turchin, a commercial broker at the firm CBRE. “And then they ended up needing more space.” As workers return, companies have had to squeeze in or rent more space. Turchin said that happened to IBM, which in 2022 decided to consolidate its multiple New York office locations in a new building at One Madison Avenue. In January, just a few months after it moved into the completed building, it signed a lease for an additional 93,000 square feet. (An IBM spokesperson said the recent lease decision was “in no way a result of not having enough space for employees currently.”) Last year, Amazon announced it would soon begin requiring full-time attendance from all of its 350,000 corporate employees. “If it’s not for you, then that’s okay. You can go and find another company if you want to,” an unsympathetic Amazon executive said at an industry conference as the company rolled out the corporate decision. Then the unforgiving policy ran up against the laws of physics. When it took effect nationwide, in January, it turned out there were not enough desks, chairs, and parking spaces to go around, creating chaos and embarrassing headlines for corporate America’s supposed logistics experts. In New York, Amazon has been rushing to find additional office space beyond what it has inside its new hub in the Lord & Taylor building, signing leases in three other buildings in the last few months. One of those new Amazon leases, completed just this month, is at 237 Park Avenue, where it is reportedly taking over a 193,000 square foot space that was put on the sublease market in 2022. The former occupant of the space was a subsidiary of WPP, which was relocated into the conglomerate’s headquarters at 3 World Trade Center. When WPP opened its World Trade Center campus in 2018, around 4,000 of its employees worked in the building. After WPP’s consolidation, the office now has a headcount of around 6,500 on paper. Although WPP has leased some additional space over the years, a former WPP employee told me the World Trade Center offices were already short on desks, conference rooms, and anyplace to make a private phone call, and had no idea how the company was possibly going to fit in everyone who is supposed to work there now that Read has told them all to come back 4 days a week. The CEO conceded he wasn’t sure himself. “If everybody follows the rules on day one, we’ll probably have some challenges,” Read told me. Although the current World Trade Center office capacity is considerably smaller than its overall headcount, in reality some percentage of employees will still not use the space. Some are assigned to be embedded with their clients. Some remote workers have been grandfathered in or have been able to negotiate waivers. Still, the office will certainly be more crowded. A WPP spokesman says that the company is not currently looking to sign new leases, but it has directed its individual companies to reassess and if necessary reconfigure their interior spaces. Five years after drawing up its strategic plan, WPP has come to the realization that desks are, in fact, essential to work. Read anticipates WPP will be stronger once its office returns to normal. “When we get through to the other side, it’s going to be better for our culture,” he says. “Our ideas will be better. And actually, our workforce, our people, will be happier.” Now they all just need a place to sit.

Gideon Spanier explains the likely impact of the impending Omnicom takeover of Interpublic. by Gideon Spanier March 20 2025 Omnicom’s takeover of Interpublic passed an “important milestone” in the words of John Wren, the chief executive of Omnicom, when shareholders of both companies voted to approve the deal at simultaneous meetings just after 9am New York time on Tuesday. The votes passed easily, with more than 90% in favor, although the takeover still requires regulatory approvals around the world to complete, likely in the second half of 2025. Now, as momentum appears to be building, the ad industry’s thoughts are turning to the impact of the merger that will create the world’s biggest agency group — with more than $25bn of global revenues, including nearly $15bn or 57% coming from the US. This deal promises a long-awaited consolidation among the big six groups, which will now become a big five, and, arguably, a big three as Omnicom, Publicis and WPP open up a gap on Dentsu and Havas, especially in the US, in terms of media-buying scale. It is a landmark moment for Interpublic, in particular. The first advertising agency holding company of the modern era launched in 1930 as McCann-Erickson, becoming Interpublic in 1961, and can trace its roots back to the founding of Erickson in 1902 and McCann in 1911. Now it is one step closer to being swallowed by Omnicom, founded in 1986. Yet there was little sense of occasion at this week’s shareholder meetings. Both were virtual events, not in-person. There was only an audio feed, not even video. In theory, shareholders could have quizzed the directors about the deal but when Krakowsky opened up the floor for questions at IPG, there was no response. “There appear to be no questions,” he said, allowing him to move swiftly to the vote. Similarly, Wren faced no questions at Omnicom’s meeting. Both events ended within ten minutes. If shareholders have doubts about the all-stock deal — Omnicom offered a 21% premium, valuing IPG at $13.3bn, in December but Omnicom’s own share price has fallen more than 20% since then, and IPG is now forecasting revenue decline this year — they chose not to air them in a public setting. The reality is that shareholder approval looked to be a fait accompli after two influential advisory groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, recommended it. The Omnicom-IPG deal is set to reshape the agency sector globally, and the US will be key. “If you think about where perceptions are formed inside large enterprises, the US has got more important, not less important, in the last five or ten years,” Rob Norman, the former chief executive of Group M North America, said. However, there is also a sense of déjà vu and a changed landscape, after the excitement of the Omnicom-Publicis $35bn mega-merger that failed to complete more than a decade ago. “There is something about this deal that feels less seismic than if it had happened 10 or 15 years ago,” Norman said. “I wonder if that speaks to a macro-diminishment of the sector as the concentration of power on the sell side with Google, Meta and Amazon has changed the power dynamic.” While Omnicom has talked about the benefits of scale from the takeover, it has also said it wants to make $750m in annual “synergies”, which is likely to mean thousands of job losses. Regulatory approvalOmnicom needs to win regulatory approval in as many as 19 jurisdictions, including from the US, UK and European Union, according to the latest update from the company. The deal has already won consent in Brazil, Colombia and Saudi Arabia.Winning the backing of the Federal Trade Commission, now led by Andrew Ferguson, a Donald Trump appointee, in the US is the priority and the regulator made a second request for information last week. “A second request can be noteworthy because most organizations make adjustments to their submission in order to address the additional questions or clarify their original submission,” Jay Pattisall, vice-president and principal analyst at Forrester and a long-time agency expert, said, although he does not see it as a likely obstacle to approval. Another industry source warned it is hard to be sure about the “pro-business” intentions of the new Trump administration, which has been shaking up the FTC, even in recent days. However, the FTC and regulators in all other key markets, except China, approved the planned Omnicom-Publicis tie-up in 2014, before the two companies walked away.While Omnicom and IPG say planning for their integration is “underway,” they “continue to operate as separate companies” as they await regulatory approval. The mood music internally suggests significant integration is likely to be several months away. Media scaleOmnicom and IPG have talked about the importance of leveraging scale in media-buying — particularly in principal-based media, which involves buying inventory in bulk to get better deals — and combining their data assets, including Omni, Flywheel and Acxiom. IPG admitted it was struggling to compete in media after losing big accounts, including Amazon, last year. In terms of media billings, the enlarged Omnicom Media Group would have 36.9% market share among the big five in the US, when it adds its existing 21.7% to IPG Mediabrands’ 15.2%, based on COMvergence estimates for media spend in 2024. That would put OMG well ahead of Publicis Media on 30.6% and WPP’s Group M on 18.5% — with Dentsu Media on 11.3% and Havas Media on 2.7%. (Figures have been approximated in the chart below.)Globally, OMG would have 32% share by adding its 20% to IPG’s 12%. That is ahead of Group M on 28% and Publicis on 24%, with Dentsu some way behind on 12% and Havas 5%. Source: estimates by COMvergence for 2024 media billingsHence the idea that there will now be a big three that will pull away from the others, although Pattisall said: “In terms of size, there is already a division among the holding company media agencies that include Group M, Omnicom Media Group and Publicis Media and another grouping including Dentsu Media, Havas Media and IPG Mediabrands. So the significance of the merger is shifting from the big six to the big five.”Greg Paull, senior principal at R3 Worldwide, a pitch consultancy, said there may be a shift towards a “big three” for large media agency reviews but noted there are many other agency services apart from media where scale matters less. Clients still put a premium on “great, creative ideas” and “I think we will see a bifurcation between media and creative,” Paull suggested.Last year’s General Motors creative review was a “wake-up call” as the US automotive giant looked beyond incumbent agencies from IPG and Publicis in favor of smaller players such as Stagwell’s 72andSunny and Anomaly and S4 Capital’s Monks, he said. Winning over clients and staffOmnicom and IPG’s biggest concerns during the current limbo period are to win and retain clients and reassure staff. Jerry Buhlmann, the former chief executive of Dentsu Aegis Group, who led the sale of Aegis to Dentsu and the subsequent integration in 2013, said: “You’ve got to be very clear about what the vision is for the new business, the combination, and why is that relevant for everyone involved and why is it better? You have to position it as different and better.”Buhlmann, who is now chair of independent agencies Dept and Croud, added it was vital to “massively over-communicate internally” during a merger process. “The senior leadership has to be unbelievably visible to everybody in that organisation. Communicate even if there isn’t anything to communicate. Communicate energy, communicate belief.” He said the message during the wait for regulatory approval should be: “Don’t worry, we’re dealing with it, this will get approved, we do have a great future. Until we can execute the plan, you’re operating individually, everyone call up your clients, tell them you love them and over-service them.”Wren and Krakwosky have co-hosted in-person meetings with staff and pitch consultants in New York and London since the start of the year. The companies were “positive and transparent,” according to Greg Paull, co-founder of R3 Worldwide, a pitch consultancy, but he warned clients still have concerns. “Clients are a combination of frustrated and interested at the same time,” Paull said. “This [deal] is moving like molasses for some of them. We’ve been in a number of holdco reviews recently where we’ve been told by the holdcos to treat them separately but there’s still a mindset from the clients of, ‘If this is likely to happen, what’s going to be the impact for them?’”Pattisall said client relations were key: “The two areas to watch during integration are conflicts between clients or industries and distractions. The former is known and each company is in discussion with their clients to resolve conflict concerns. The latter is a more significant issue in that a sluggish integration could distract from client delivery.” Omnicom and IPG have been cutting US jobs ahead of mergerOmnicom and IPG employed about 74,900 and 53,300 respectively, or just over 128,000 in total globally, at the end of 2024. Their combined headcount dropped by about 5,000 during last year, including the impact of acquisitions and disposals. Their US employee base was especially hard hit as both companies looked for savings. Omnicom’s staff fell by 2,800 to 21,900 in its home market, partly as it moved roles to lower-cost centers in Latin America. IPG’s domestic headcount dropped by 2,700 to 21,100, partly because of disposals, including Huge, and client losses such as Pfizer.The companies have talked about the combined group having only “over 100,000 practitioners.” Wren and Krakowsky have stressed they are looking to protect “revenue-generating” and “client-facing” roles but they have also signaled they expect to “offshore” more jobs to cheaper locations.Buhlmann warned against what he called a “drawn-out, slow rationalization” and said it was important to move “quickly” to make major changes to ensure a successful integration.Norman added the merger would allow the new Omnicom to reshape the business and use its greater scale to attract talent as well as invest in technology. “They’ve got the opportunity to downsize and upskill,” he said, speculating that the company might look to find closer to $1bn in efficiencies and then invest $250m in new talent and recruiting from rivals. Importance of executionUltimately, the success of the Omnicom-IPG deal will depend on execution. Wren, the CEO since 1997, previously told Campaign at the time of the deal announcement in December that he expects to stay in the role for three years — with Krakowksy, who has been CEO of IPG since 2021, moving to be co-chief operating officer, alongside Omnicom’s COO, Daryl Simm.Buhlmann said: “They’re in a perfect position to define a strategy that can change the market.” But relying on scale alone is not enough. “If you don’t do anything, you remain a super-tanker, and if you tie two super-tankers together, you don’t get a speedboat.”Omnicom will need to leverage its new scale — whether in talent, media, creative, technology or artificial intelligence. “If you have that scale of resource, people and media and you work out how you leverage it to your competitive advantage, you have a real proposition you can take to market,” Buhlmann said, adding rivals will also be looking to exploit the upheaval.“Disruption in the advertising sector, largely through technology, has always enabled new players to grow, innovative businesses to take market share and independents to penetrate the holdcos, who are often slower and suffer from inertia. Disruption is a big leveller. ”Perhaps the greatest challenge for both Omnicom and the wider agency sector is to find more stable and recurring sources of revenue and rely less on classic advertising agency services — an area where Publicis has been leading the market, especially in the US, where it generates close to 60% of its revenues.“The marketing agency industry is mature and primarily follows a service model for commercial relationships,” Pattisall said. “The prevalence of technology and investments in agency tech creates the opportunity to craft a new commercial model that includes software as a service [SaaS] and other services.

Jerry Buhlmann, the former chief executive of Dentsu Aegis Group, who led the sale of Aegis to Dentsu and the subsequent integration in 2013, said: “You’ve got to be very clear about what the vision is for the new business, the combination, and why is that relevant for everyone involved and why is it better? You have to position it as different and better.”Buhlmann, who is now chair of independent agencies Dept and Croud, added it was vital to “massively over-communicate internally” during a merger process. “The senior leadership has to be unbelievably visible to everybody in that organisation. Communicate even if there isn’t anything to communicate. Communicate energy, communicate belief.” He said the message during the wait for regulatory approval should be: “Don’t worry, we’re dealing with it, this will get approved, we do have a great future. Until we can execute the plan, you’re operating individually, everyone call up your clients, tell them you love them and over-service them.”Wren and Krakwosky have co-hosted in-person meetings with staff and pitch consultants in New York and London since the start of the year. The companies were “positive and transparent,” according to Greg Paull, co-founder of R3 Worldwide, a pitch consultancy, but he warned clients still have concerns. “Clients are a combination of frustrated and interested at the same time,” Paull said. “This [deal] is moving like molasses for some of them. We’ve been in a number of holdco reviews recently where we’ve been told by the holdcos to treat them separately but there’s still a mindset from the clients of, ‘If this is likely to happen, what’s going to be the impact for them?’”Pattisall said client relations were key: “The two areas to watch during integration are conflicts between clients or industries and distractions. The former is known and each company is in discussion with their clients to resolve conflict concerns. The latter is a more significant issue in that a sluggish integration could distract from client delivery.” Omnicom and IPG have been cutting US jobs ahead of mergerOmnicom and IPG employed about 74,900 and 53,300 respectively, or just over 128,000 in total globally, at the end of 2024. Their combined headcount dropped by about 5,000 during last year, including the impact of acquisitions and disposals. Their US employee base was especially hard hit as both companies looked for savings. Omnicom’s staff fell by 2,800 to 21,900 in its home market, partly as it moved roles to lower-cost centers in Latin America. IPG’s domestic headcount dropped by 2,700 to 21,100, partly because of disposals, including Huge, and client losses such as Pfizer.The companies have talked about the combined group having only “over 100,000 practitioners.” Wren and Krakowsky have stressed they are looking to protect “revenue-generating” and “client-facing” roles but they have also signaled they expect to “offshore” more jobs to cheaper locations.Buhlmann warned against what he called a “drawn-out, slow rationalization” and said it was important to move “quickly” to make major changes to ensure a successful integration.Norman added the merger would allow the new Omnicom to reshape the business and use its greater scale to attract talent as well as invest in technology. “They’ve got the opportunity to downsize and upskill,” he said, speculating that the company might look to find closer to $1bn in efficiencies and then invest $250m in new talent and recruiting from rivals. Importance of executionUltimately, the success of the Omnicom-IPG deal will depend on execution. Wren, the CEO since 1997, previously told Campaign at the time of the deal announcement in December that he expects to stay in the role for three years — with Krakowksy, who has been CEO of IPG since 2021, moving to be co-chief operating officer, alongside Omnicom’s COO, Daryl Simm.Buhlmann said: “They’re in a perfect position to define a strategy that can change the market.” But relying on scale alone is not enough. “If you don’t do anything, you remain a super-tanker, and if you tie two super-tankers together, you don’t get a speedboat.”Omnicom will need to leverage its new scale — whether in talent, media, creative, technology or artificial intelligence. “If you have that scale of resource, people and media and you work out how you leverage it to your competitive advantage, you have a real proposition you can take to market,” Buhlmann said, adding rivals will also be looking to exploit the upheaval.“Disruption in the advertising sector, largely through technology, has always enabled new players to grow, innovative businesses to take market share and independents to penetrate the holdcos, who are often slower and suffer from inertia. Disruption is a big leveller. ”Perhaps the greatest challenge for both Omnicom and the wider agency sector is to find more stable and recurring sources of revenue and rely less on classic advertising agency services — an area where Publicis has been leading the market, especially in the US, where it generates close to 60% of its revenues.“The marketing agency industry is mature and primarily follows a service model for commercial relationships,” Pattisall said. “The prevalence of technology and investments in agency tech creates the opportunity to craft a new commercial model that includes software as a service [SaaS] and other services.

Source: estimates by COMvergence for 2024 media billings Hence the idea that there will now be a big three that will pull away from the others, although Pattisall said: “In terms of size, there is already a division among the holding company media agencies that include Group M, Omnicom Media Group and Publicis Media and another grouping including Dentsu Media, Havas Media and IPG Mediabrands. So the significance of the merger is shifting from the big six to the big five.” Greg Paull, senior principal at R3 Worldwide, a pitch consultancy, said there may be a shift towards a “big three” for large media agency reviews but noted there are many other agency services apart from media where scale matters less. Clients still put a premium on “great, creative ideas” and “I think we will see a bifurcation between media and creative,” Paull suggested.

Title: Nvidia, Musk's xAI to Join Microsoft, BlackRock and MGX to Develop AI Infrastructure

Photo Credit: Unsplash/ Markus Winkler Tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters to meet AI-related energy demands Nvidia and Elon Musk's xAI have joined a consortium backed by Microsoft, investment fund MGX and BlackRock to expand AI infrastructure in the US, the companies said on Wednesday, as a global race to dominate the nascent technology intensifies. The group, formed last year with a goal to initially invest more than $30 billion (roughly Rs. 2,58,984 crore) in AI-related projects, is one of the biggest efforts to bankroll data centers and energy facilities needed to power AI applications such as ChatGPT. The additions come two months after US President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a private sector AI infrastructure initiative backed by SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle, with plans to mobilise up to $500 billion (roughly Rs. 43,16,626 crore). Investors have committed $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,63,500 crore) for immediate deployment, with the rest expected over the next four years. The consortium - which includes BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners - on Wednesday renamed itself as AI Infrastructure Partnership. Nvidia, a technical advisor, will continue in the role. Training AI models and large-scale data processing require huge computational power, which increases energy consumption. To meet the demands, tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters, driving a surge for specialised data centers. To fund the computing and power needs, the consortium has been looking to raise money from investors, asset owners and corporations, with a goal to mobilise up to $100 billion (roughly Rs. 8,63,500 crore), including debt financing. "AIP has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September," the group said, but did not disclose the total funds raised so far. GE Vernova and utility firm NextEra Energy will also be a part of the group, it said, adding the renewable energy company will work on supply-chain planning and high efficiency energy solutions. AIP said its investments will also focus on US partners and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Panama ports deal: Who is billionaire Li Ka-shing? How did Hong Kong's richest man anger China?

Time Published: 2025-03-20T06:28:21Z
Full Content:
United States President Donald Trump is reportedly “very pleased” with the sale of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings' Panama ports assets to a consortium that includes US investing giant BlackRock. Amid lashing from Chinese media for “disloyalty” and CK Hutchison's defence that the transaction was purely commercial in nature, we take a look at who Li Ka-shing is, and why Beijing is displeased and the significance of Li Ka-shing's Panama deal amid US-China tensions and Donald Trump's tariff wars. ‘Rags-to-riches’ business mogul,96-year-old Li Ka-shing built Hong Kong's prestigious CK Hutchison Holdings, according to an AP report. He is the richest man in the region and among the top 50 richest in the world according to Forbes. The publication puts his net worth at $38 billion. While Li retired from his post of Chairman in 2018 and was suceeded by his son, the billionaire, nicknamed “Superman” is still among the region's most influencial figures, the AP report added. He rose to prominence from the former British colony to expand interests in real estate, telecom, supermarkets and utilities. The company also operates Superdrug (British chemist franchise) and Three (European mobile network firm), the report added. Li is now in the spotlight since his company's deal (announced on March 4) to sell its subsidiaries' ports in the Panama Canal — an asset it had held since 1997. The biggest rub is that the buyer is a consortium that includes US investment firm BlackRock and comes while US President Donald Trump has accused China of interfearing in the Panama Canal. Li is not a stranger to Beijing's reach in Hong Kong — he was part of the committee that helped select the financial hub's new leader when it was brought under administrative control of China, the report said. The past week has seen local media outlets push criticism against the deal sourced to Beijing's local affairs office, the report noted. And while Chinese leaders acknowledge that support for local business tycoons can help preserve Hong Kong's capitalistic system, Li who has lent has influence, is not free from criticism. In 2015, Li faced accusations of “immorality” for selling assets in mainland China; then in 2019 during the pro-democracy protests some in Beijing were unhappy by his “percieved ambivalence”. Now in 2025, the Panama posts deal has opened a can of worms. Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he would seize control of the Panama Canal, which is a key global trade channel. The ports held by CK Holdings are on each end of the Canal and strategically important. US-based BlackRock having some control over its operations has been music to Donald Trump's ears. But China is fuming. The nearly $23 billion deal, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. In its commentary, a Beijing-backed newspaper termed the deal a “betrayal of all Chinese” and asked to company to choose a side and warned against “dance with” US politicians. AP cited some local reports say that Chinese leaders were also angered about not being consulted before the deal was made, given that ports are a strategic asset and make for sensitive transactions on a good day. At present it is unclear whether China will pull the plug on this deal and the country's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about investigations into the matter. Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy, told the agency that cancelling the deal now would be risky. “Strictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say ‘Sorry, I’m canceling the deal.’ You can imagine what Trump’s reaction would be,” he said. Longer term, while Li could try to make good with Chinese leaders, and use the money from the deal for investments in the mainland, relations between companies and the government may still be rough, the report noted. "If Beijing steps up pressure on Li to scrap the Panama deal, the Trump administration could hit back with more sanctions and restrictions on Hong Kong and Chinese businesses and some individuals. The situation shows that Washington’s concerns about Hong Kong's business autonomy are valid. This is bad when it comes to the defense of ‘one country, two systems,’” George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm told AP.

Title: Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, is in hot water

Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing HONG KONG -- Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing. Over the past week, Beijing's Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal by Hutchison, which is controlled by Li’s family. That raises questions about the deal and highlights the difficulties Hong Kong businesses face as they balance demands from Beijing for national loyalty and their own capitalist interests in the once free-wheeling Asian financial hub. Here's what to know about the issue. Nicknamed “Superman,” Li is among the world’s 50 richest people, with Forbes calculating his net worth at $38 billion. Li, 96, retired from his position as chairman of CK Hutchison in 2018, succeeded by his elder son Victor. But he's still one of Hong Kong's most influential figures. Li's rags-to-riches story paralleled the former British colony’s rise. His business empire touches almost every aspect of daily life in Hong Kong, from properties and supermarkets to telecommunications and utilities. Globally, his conglomerate owns assets including British drugstore chain Superdrug and European mobile phone network operator Three. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. That was one reason U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane's operations. Li’s influence extends beyond business. He has met with top Chinese leaders and has served on the elite committee that selected Hong Kong’s leader. Experts on ties between Beijing and Hong Kong said ruling Communist Party leaders once understood that support from the business sector was crucial for maintaining Hong Kong’s capitalist system. It's has been strategically vital for mainland China’s economy, given the role their global networks and resources play in the country’s development. So, Li has had notable political influence. But Li has faced criticism over some business decisions. When he sold off some mainland Chinese assets in 2015, an article published by a think tank affiliated with Chinese official news agency Xinhua accused him of being immoral. During pro-democracy protests in 2019, Li was blasted by some pro-Beijing supporters for his perceived ambivalence about the unrest. Some other Hong Kong business leaders adopted a harsher stance. CK Hutchison announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, which is chaired by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li’s. If approved, the deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. The transaction does not include ports in Hong Kong or mainland China. CK Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial in nature. The deal pleased Trump but angered Beijing. One of the Beijing-backed newspaper commentaries described the deal as a betrayal of all Chinese and said the company should think about which side to take. The other said great entrepreneurs are patriots, suggesting that businesspeople who “dance with” predatory American politicians would be doomed to infamy. Comments on popular posts about the deal on Chinese social media platform Weibo tend to be more critical than favorable toward Li. Chief Executive John Lee avoided direct criticism of the deal or Trump, but told reporters on Tuesday his government opposes bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations, reiterating Beijing's stance. Some unconfirmed reports have suggested Chinese leaders were angry not to have been consulted in advance about the deal. George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm, said Beijing may have been disappointed because it had almost no time to devise a response in advance. Ports are valuable strategic assets and transactions involving them are always sensitive, said Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy. It is unclear whether pressure from Beijing will affect the deal, which has to be approved by Panama's government. China’s Foreign Ministry deflected a question about whether authorities are investigating the deal, saying reporters should ask other authorities. CK Hutchison has not commented on the controversy. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it was not planning a news conference. Cancelling the deal would be risky, Chan said. “Strictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say ‘Sorry, I’m canceling the deal.’ You can imagine what Trump’s reaction would be,” he said, adding that would also affect how the outside world views Hong Kong businesses. The first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for undermining the autonomy of the territory promised when Britain handed its colony to Beijing in 1997 under a concept dubbed “One country, two systems.” It promised the city could keep its Western-style civil liberties and economic autonomy for at least 50 years, but following the 2019 protests, Beijing has doubled-down on its political control of the city. Li could try to placate critics who deem him insufficiently patriotic, Chan said, by using proceeds from selling the port assets for investments aligned with Beijing’s policies, particularly in developing Hong Kong and mainland port businesses. But relations between private businesses and Beijing remain uncertain, said The Asia Group's Chen. Even though Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met with private sector business leaders in a show of support, some may wonder if they must follow the party line even if that might conflict with their business interests, he said. If Beijing steps up pressure on Li to scrap the deal, the Trump administration could hit back with more sanctions and restrictions on Hong Kong and Chinese businesses and some individuals, he said. The situation shows that Washington’s concerns about Hong Kong's business autonomy are valid, Chen said. “This is bad when it comes to the defense of ‘one country, two systems,’” Chen said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Bitcoin Price Still Ignores Wall Street Demand, BlackRock Exec Warns
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-ignores-wall-street-demand-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T05:00:29Z
Full Content:
In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Robbie Mitchnick—Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock—addressed Bitcoin’s recent stagnation and shared why he believes institutional demand may be stronger than its price implies. Despite significant hopes pinned on regulatory developments and a “crypto-friendly” turn at the White House, Bitcoin has spent the early months of 2025 hovering around the mid-$80,000 range, prompting questions about what catalysts might drive the next price rally. Mitchnick acknowledged that Bitcoin started showing considerable strength toward the end of 2024. “Bitcoin is still up, let’s call it 15% or so since the beginning of November,” he noted. This rally, he explained, was fueled by a combination of institutional interest and optimism surrounding potential government endorsement by the Trump administration. However, he cautioned that “accelerated, perhaps premature expectations of just how quickly some of these catalysts would start to arrive” might have contributed to the market’s more recent price stagnation. According to Mitchnick, many investors and traders anticipated an immediate spike following the White House’s pro-crypto moves. When those gains failed to materialize, some short-term participants began unwinding positions, contributing to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. BlackRock made headlines with its Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, widely recognized for bringing a new wave of institutional exposure to the crypto market. Even so, Mitchnick revealed that inflows have softened: “2024 was pretty incredible, pretty historic on that front. 2025 to start has been more negative. We’ve seen some outflows in the category—relatively modest in the context of the overall asset base, which is close to $100 billion.” He attributed this downturn mostly to hedge funds unwinding a spot–futures arbitrage trade that had “double-digit” yields in 2024 but has since dipped into the single digits. Mitchnick underscored that these outflows are mainly from short-term traders, rather than the more traditional “buy-and-hold” investor base. A central question raised in the interview was why Bitcoin has not acted as a safe haven—similar to gold—despite persistent economic uncertainty. While gold has rallied on investor concerns about the economy, Bitcoin has not mirrored that trajectory. Mitchnick suggested that this discrepancy stems from market psychology and what he called “short-term correlation spikes.” “Bitcoin fundamentally on a long-term basis … should be uncorrelated or even inversely correlated against certain risk factors … But now it’s been extrapolated to things that don’t really make any sense at all—tariffs, economic fears—and the market’s commentary doesn’t reflect what Bitcoin fundamentally is,” Mitchnick said. He went on to emphasize Bitcoin’s unique attributes—its scarcity, decentralized nature, and existence “outside of any one country’s economic, political, or monetary system.” Over the long term, Mitchnick sees these properties as justifying Bitcoin’s “digital gold” comparison, but concedes that investor behavior often treats it as a high-volatility, “risk-on” asset in the short run. When asked about the US government’s stance—particularly in light of a Trump administration authorization for a strategic Bitcoin reserve—Mitchnick was cautious, noting that “a lot still [remains] to be determined on that front.” He emphasized that: “What we have clearly seen is a pretty emphatic signal of support and conviction in this industry and particularly in Bitcoin and Bitcoin’s uniqueness … Whether and on what timeline … that might be funded, there’s a few different sources … but it’s certainly not the only source of adoption catalyst in 2025.” Although speculation is building around whether the government will officially begin stockpiling Bitcoin, Mitchnick stressed that the broader institutional and wealth advisory community continues accumulating positions. These investors, in his view, remain “very excited” by current market conditions despite the recent downturn. Mitchnick also addressed recent headwinds, including the ByBit hack that briefly dampened market sentiment. He suggested that heightened volatility can shake short-term traders out of the market, but longer-term, more sophisticated holders often see price dips as buying opportunities. According to Mitchnick: “Some of them were taking chips off the table a little bit in the [$100,000] range … Now they see this correction and a lot of them view it as sort of an irrational selloff … We’re trying to bring some quantitative rigor to that as well.” At press time, BTC traded at $84,197.

I will never go a day without Prime Biome again." 2. Daniel R., 45 – Austin, TX "As someone in my 40s, I noticed my skin aging faster and constantly bloating after meals.

If you’ve been struggling with gut issues, skin problems, or both, this probiotic formula might be the breakthrough you need. How Does Prime Biome Work? The Science Behind Its Powerful Effects The secret behind Prime Biome’s success isn’t just about probiotics—it’s about the gut-skin axis and how a balanced microbiome plays a direct role in skin cell regeneration, digestion, and inflammation control. This supplement is formulated to target the underlying causes of digestive discomfort, poor nutrient absorption, and premature skin aging, rather than just masking symptoms like conventional probiotics or skincare products. By combining clinically-backed probiotic strains with powerful botanicals, Prime Biome delivers a multi-faceted approach to gut and skin health, ensuring that your body isn’t just looking better but actually functioning optimally from the inside out. Here’s a deep dive into how this supplement works at a cellular level. 1. Rebuilding the Gut Microbiome for Lasting Balance At the heart of Prime Biome’s effectiveness is its ability to restore and maintain a thriving gut microbiome. Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, and when the balance is thrown off—due to diet, stress, medications, or environmental toxins—it leads to digestive distress, chronic inflammation, and even skin problems like acne, dullness, and premature aging. One of the key probiotic strains in Prime Biome, Bacillus Coagulans, has been clinically studied for its ability to survive stomach acid and reach the intestines alive. Unlike traditional probiotics, which often get destroyed by the harsh stomach environment, Bacillus Coagulans form protective spores, allowing them to colonize the gut and repopulate good bacteria effectively. Study Spotlight:A 2022 study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Microbiology found that Bacillus Coagulans supplementation led to a 48% reduction in bloating, a 39% improvement in digestion, and a 41% decrease in skin inflammation within eight weeks of use. >>Warning: Avoid Fake Sellers! Get the Authentic Product Only from the Official Website – 75% Off Here. By feeding the gut with beneficial bacteria, Prime Biome helps to: ✔ Reduce bloating and indigestion by improving food breakdown and absorption. ✔ Eliminate toxins that contribute to inflammation and skin irritation. ✔ Balance gut bacteria, ensuring a stronger immune system and a healthier skin barrier. 2. Enhancing Skin Cell Turnover for a Youthful Glow The gut-skin connection is one of the most overlooked factors in skincare. Most people rely on topical creams and serums, but the truth is, healthy skin starts from within. Prime Biome’s formula is designed to accelerate skin cell renewal by supporting collagen production and reducing oxidative stress, leading to firmer, clearer, and more resilient skin. One of the standout ingredients is Babchi (Bakuchiol)—a plant-derived compound often called “Nature’s Retinol” for its ability to stimulate collagen, reduce hyperpigmentation, and smooth out fine lines. Unlike traditional retinol, Babchi doesn’t cause irritation, dryness, or sensitivity—making it a perfect ingredient for gentle but effective skin renewal. Study Spotlight:A 2023 clinical trial conducted by the American Dermatological Society found that Babchi extract increased skin elasticity by 36% and improved hydration levels by 47% after six weeks of consistent use. By stimulating collagen and cellular repair, Prime Biome helps: ✔ Reduce fine lines and wrinkles by promoting faster cell turnover. ✔ Even out skin tone by minimizing hyperpigmentation and redness. ✔ Strengthen the skin barrier, protecting against environmental damage and premature aging. >>Big Savings Alert: Buy Direct & Save! Get 75% Off + $300 Discount from the Official Site. 3. Reducing Inflammation for Gut and Skin Harmony Chronic inflammation is one of the biggest contributors to digestive distress, acne breakouts, and premature aging. When your gut microbiome is out of balance, it triggers systemic inflammation, leading to poor digestion, increased breakouts, and even conditions like rosacea and eczema. To combat this, Prime Biome includes Lemon Balm and Organic Ceylon Ginger, two powerhouse anti-inflammatory ingredients known for their ability to soothe gut irritation, reduce oxidative stress, and calm the nervous system. Study Spotlight:A 2024 meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Inflammatory Diseases found that Lemon Balm extract reduced systemic inflammation markers by 42% in individuals with gut dysbiosis and inflammatory skin conditions. By targeting the root causes of inflammation, Prime Biome: ✔ Soothes gut lining irritation, preventing bloating and acid reflux. ✔ Reduces skin redness and sensitivity, calming acne and eczema flare-ups. ✔ Lowers oxidative stress, protecting cells from damage that leads to premature aging. 4. Optimizing Nutrient Absorption for Full-Body Benefits Even if you’re eating a healthy diet, your body might not be absorbing the full spectrum of nutrients due to gut imbalances. A damaged gut lining reduces nutrient uptake, meaning your body isn’t getting the vitamins and minerals it needs for energy, skin repair, and overall wellness. This is why Prime Biome includes Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin—two prebiotic-rich ingredients that strengthen gut lining integrity and optimize nutrient absorption. These plant-based compounds feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, ensuring that they flourish and support better digestion, increased hydration, and a more resilient immune system. Study Spotlight: A 2025 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Sciences reported that participants supplementing with Inulin and Slippery Elm Bark showed a 58% increase in nutrient absorption and a 33% improvement in digestive efficiency. By improving nutrient bioavailability, Prime Biome helps to: ✔ Enhance energy levels, reducing brain fog and chronic fatigue. ✔ Boost skin hydration, making your complexion more radiant and plump. ✔ Support immunity, giving your body the strength to fight off inflammation and toxins. >>MUST-SEE: Shocking New Report Reveals the Truth About Prime Biome – Does It Work?

Prime Biome Ingredients – What’s Inside and Why It Works The carefully selected ingredients in Prime Biome make it one of the most powerful gut-skin health supplements available today. Each component is backed by scientific research, ensuring that every gummy delivers maximum benefits for digestion, microbiome balance, and skin renewal. Unlike other probiotic supplements that simply introduce bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by ensuring that those bacteria thrive, repairing the gut barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting healthy skin cell turnover. Bacillus Coagulans is a unique spore-forming probiotic that survives the acidic environment of the stomach. Many probiotics die before they reach the intestines, but Bacillus Coagulans remains stable and activates exactly where it's needed. This probiotic supports a healthy gut microbiome, improves nutrient absorption, and strengthens the connection between gut and skin health. A 2025 clinical study found that people supplementing with Bacillus Coagulans saw a 49% improvement in digestion and a 35% reduction in skin irritation within eight weeks. Babchi is a rare botanical known for its skin-rejuvenating properties. Unlike harsh retinoids that cause irritation, Babchi provides natural collagen-boosting effects, helping to maintain skin elasticity. Its antioxidant-rich profile also neutralizes free radicals that contribute to premature aging, breakouts, and inflammation. Research suggests that regular use of Babchi may enhance skin firmness by 31% within three months. Dandelion is an underrated detoxifying herb that helps the liver and digestive system eliminate waste and excess toxins. Poor digestion often leads to toxic buildup in the bloodstream, which manifests as dull, acne-prone skin and bloating. Dandelion extract works by stimulating bile production, supporting digestion, and reducing gut inflammation, making it a critical component in restoring gut-skin harmony. Fennel is a potent digestive aid that helps reduce bloating, gas, and discomfort. It is particularly beneficial for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic digestive distress. By soothing the gut lining and promoting the movement of food through the intestines, fennel ensures a smooth digestive process, leading to clearer, healthier skin. Inulin is a prebiotic fiber that acts as fuel for probiotics, ensuring that the beneficial bacteria in Prime Biome can flourish. Without prebiotics, probiotics struggle to colonize the gut, reducing their effectiveness. Inulin helps stabilize blood sugar levels, improves digestion, and supports immune function, making it an essential component in long-term gut health. >>FLASH SALE: Secure Your 75% Discount Now – Limited Stock! Fenugreek is known for its ability to balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and support gut microbiome diversity. Unstable blood sugar levels often lead to hormonal imbalances that trigger acne and skin irritation. By keeping blood sugar steady, Fenugreek helps regulate oil production, reducing breakouts and promoting a clear, even complexion. A clinical trial published in 2024 found that Fenugreek supplementation led to a 41% reduction in inflammatory skin conditions and improved digestive function in participants. Lemon Balm is a powerful stress-reducing adaptogen that plays a critical role in supporting the gut-brain axis. Chronic stress is one of the leading causes of gut imbalances and skin issues, as elevated cortisol levels disrupt digestion and increase inflammation. Lemon Balm helps lower stress hormones, allowing the gut microbiome to rebalance naturally, leading to better digestion, reduced bloating, and a calmer, healthier complexion. Organic Ceylon Ginger is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory ingredients in Prime Biome. Unlike regular ginger, Ceylon Ginger contains higher concentrations of gingerol, which reduces gut inflammation, supports circulation, and improves digestion efficiency. Better circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach skin cells, improving hydration and elasticity while reducing puffiness and dark spots. Organic Lion’s Mane is a rare medicinal mushroom that enhances cognitive function, gut health, and immune system strength. One of its lesser-known benefits is its ability to promote gut barrier integrity, reducing the risk of leaky gut syndrome. This, in turn, leads to clearer skin, reduced inflammation, and better overall wellness. A 2025 study found that individuals taking Lion’s Mane experienced a 38% improvement in gut microbiome diversity and a significant reduction in oxidative stress levels. Slippery Elm Bark is a well-documented gut-healing botanical that soothes intestinal irritation, reduces bloating, and enhances nutrient absorption. It forms a protective layer over the digestive lining, preventing toxins from leaking into the bloodstream, a common issue that contributes to chronic inflammation, acne, and dull skin. This natural protective effect makes it one of the most powerful gut-soothing ingredients in Prime Biome. Why the Combination of These Ingredients Makes Prime Biome So Effective The true power of Prime Biome lies in its formulation. Each ingredient was chosen to create a synergistic effect, meaning that the combination delivers results that are far more powerful than using any single ingredient alone. Many probiotic supplements fail because they lack prebiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and skin-supporting botanicals. Prime Biome’s formulation solves this by ensuring that every ingredient works together to target gut health, inflammation control, and skin regeneration simultaneously. The balance of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-supporting botanicals ensures a thriving microbiome, better digestion, and more radiant skin over time. The absence of stimulants, fillers, and synthetic ingredients makes Prime Biome a truly clean and effective formula for people struggling with bloating, digestive issues, and skin concerns.

The Life-Changing Benefits of Prime Biome It’s not just a probiotic. It’s not just a skin supplement. Prime Biome is a complete transformation system, designed to revive digestion, restore microbiome balance, and enhance skin health from within. If you’ve been dealing with bloating, gut discomfort, unpredictable digestion, dull skin, or premature aging, ignoring Prime Biome might be the biggest mistake you didn’t know you were making. Most supplements promise short-term, surface-level benefits. Prime Biome, on the other hand, gets to the root cause of your problems—poor gut health, inflammation, and microbial imbalance—fixing them from within. When your microbiome is optimized, your digestion works effortlessly, your skin glows, your energy levels skyrocket, and your immune system becomes stronger than ever. 1. Revives Digestion and Eliminates Bloating Like Nothing Else Anyone who has suffered from bloating, indigestion, constipation, or food sensitivities knows how frustrating it is to feel like your gut is constantly working against you. The problem? Most digestion supplements fail because they only mask symptoms rather than addressing the root cause—a poorly functioning gut microbiome. Prime Biome is different. It restores balance from within, using a powerful blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-healing botanicals that optimize digestion long-term. This isn’t just another "gut health" product that gives you temporary relief. Prime Biome reshapes your digestion permanently, allowing you to enjoy food without discomfort, bloating, or unpredictability. >> See how Prime Biome can transform your digestion – Learn more. 2. Turns Back the Clock on Aging Skin—From the Inside Out Think your skincare routine is enough? Think again. Your gut controls how your skin ages. You can spend hundreds of dollars on creams, retinoids, and serums, but if your microbiome is imbalanced, your skin will continue aging prematurely. Prime Biome does what no topical skin care product can—rebuilds healthy skin at the cellular level. No other supplement combines these skin-enhancing benefits with deep gut healing. That’s why people who use Prime Biome report visibly younger, clearer, and more radiant skin within weeks. >> See how Prime Biome can revitalize your skin from within – Click here. 3. Balances Hormones and Boosts Metabolism If you’ve been struggling with unexplained weight gain, sluggish energy, or mood swings, your gut is likely out of balance. A poorly functioning gut leads to hormonal chaos, making it harder for your body to burn fat, control cravings, and sustain high energy levels. Prime Biome’s unique formula corrects this imbalance by: Most people assume that slowed metabolism is a normal part of aging, but the truth is your gut plays a far bigger role than you realize. Prime Biome ensures your hormones stay balanced, metabolism stays high, and fat-burning remains effortless. >> Unlock the secret to effortless weight management – Learn more. 4. Strengthens Immunity and Reduces Chronic Inflammation A weak immune system isn’t just about getting sick more often. Chronic inflammation—triggered by poor gut health—leads to: If your gut is inflamed, your entire body is suffering—even if you don’t realize it yet. Prime Biome’s potent probiotics, prebiotics, and antioxidants work to eliminate inflammation at its source, strengthening immunity on a cellular level. No single ingredient supplement can deliver this level of immune support. Prime Biome’s full-spectrum formula ensures your body stays resilient, energized, and free from chronic inflammation. >> Stop chronic inflammation before it starts – Learn more. Are There Any Prime Biome Complaints? What You Should Know With over 15,000+ verified users, Prime Biome has built a reputation as one of the most effective gut-skin health supplements available today. But like any highly popular product, it has attracted its share of misinformation, fake reviews, and misconceptions. 1. The Truth About Fake Prime Biome Products One of the biggest issues is counterfeit supplements being sold on unauthorized platforms like Amazon, eBay, and third-party sellers. These fake products look identical to Prime Biome but contain low-quality, ineffective ingredients, leading to negative experiences and false complaints. Many customers who unknowingly purchased fake versions have reported zero results, not realizing they were not taking the real, clinically-backed Prime Biome formula. >> Avoid fakes! Order Prime Biome directly from the official website. 2. Are Competitors Trying to Sabotage Prime Biome? As Prime Biome’s popularity exploded, some competitors have resorted to unethical tactics to discredit it. There have been reports of: The reality? Prime Biome is disrupting the market, and companies that sell overpriced, ineffective supplements are losing customers fast. 3. Customers Who Give Up Too Soon Some negative reviews come from users who expect instant results. Unlike stimulant-based products that give you a temporary high, Prime Biome works by rebuilding gut health gradually. For best results, users should take Prime Biome consistently for at least 4-6 weeks to allow full microbiome restoration, improved digestion, and visible skin improvements. 4. Is Prime Biome a Scam? Absolutely Not. Prime Biome is backed by verified scientific research, real user success stories, and a 60-day money-back guarantee. Every bottle is produced in FDA-inspected, GMP-certified facilities, ensuring that customers receive only the highest-quality formula. Unlike questionable supplements, Prime Biome offers full consumer protection, including: >> Don’t fall for fake reviews—try Prime Biome risk-free today. Is Prime Biome Safe? Side Effects, Medical Backing & FDA Compliance When it comes to health supplements, safety is the number one concern—and for good reason. People are tired of hidden additives, artificial fillers, and sketchy products that claim to be “natural” but lead to unexpected side effects. Prime Biome is different. It’s not just another probiotic—it’s a science-backed, doctor-formulated supplement designed for long-term safety and effectiveness. But with so many gut health products on the market, does Prime Biome truly stand out as a safe, risk-free choice? That’s exactly what we’ll uncover here. Does Prime Biome Have Side Effects? Here’s the Truth The reality is that Prime Biome is extremely well-tolerated, with no serious reported side effects from real users. However, like any probiotic or gut-supporting supplement, there can be temporary adjustments as your microbiome rebalances. Some new users experience mild bloating or gas in the first few days, which is actually a sign that the probiotics are working. When beneficial bacteria begin repopulating the gut, they start to outcompete harmful bacteria, which can lead to a brief period of digestive adjustment. This is completely normal and should subside within a few days as your body adjusts to a healthier gut environment. Most users find that after a short period, their digestion becomes smoother than ever—with reduced bloating, better regularity, and improved overall comfort. Another important factor to consider is allergies. Prime Biome is free from common allergies like gluten, dairy, and soy, making it a safe choice for those with sensitivities. However, if you have specific plant allergies, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting. >> See why Prime Biome is trusted by thousands for gut and skin health – Learn more. The Scientific Testing Behind Prime Biome’s Ingredients Every single ingredient in Prime Biome has been carefully selected and clinically tested for safety and effectiveness. Unlike many “mystery blend” supplements that don’t disclose their full ingredient list, Prime Biome is completely transparent—so you know exactly what’s going into your body. Every batch of Prime Biome is lab-tested for purity and potency, ensuring each gummy contains the optimal amount of these clinically supported ingredients. >> Discover the scientifically backed formula of Prime Biome – Click here. How GMP Certification and FDA Compliance Ensure 100% Safety Prime Biome is manufactured in a state-of-the-art, FDA-inspected facility that follows strict Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). What does this mean for you? Absolute safety, quality, and consistency. Many supplements on the market cut corners during manufacturing, using cheap fillers, unverified ingredients, or low-quality processing. That’s never the case with Prime Biome. Every bottle undergoes rigorous third-party testing to confirm purity, potency, and safety. Here’s why this matters: These strict safety measures separate Prime Biome from other supplements that lack proper regulation. If a product is not made in a GMP-certified facility, you should be questioning its safety. Debunking the Myth: “Natural Ingredients Can Still Be Dangerous” There’s a common misconception that just because something is “natural,” it’s automatically safe. While some herbal supplements do have risks, Prime Biome was specifically formulated by medical professionals to be both effective AND safe. Here’s why Prime Biome’s formula is different from unregulated, “natural” supplements that could pose risks: The problem with many supplements is poor-quality sourcing—some companies use low-grade, contaminated, or improperly dosed ingredients, leading to potential safety concerns. Prime Biome avoids these issues by using only premium, carefully sourced botanicals and probiotics. Long-Term Use: Is Prime Biome Safe Over Months or Years? Unlike stimulant-based weight loss pills or harsh detox supplements that can cause issues with long-term use, Prime Biome is designed to be taken daily for lasting benefits. Gut health isn’t something you fix overnight—it’s a lifelong commitment. The longer you take Prime Biome, the stronger your microbiome becomes, leading to: Because Prime Biome is free from additives, artificial chemicals, and stimulants, there is zero risk of dependency, withdrawal, or long-term damage. Users who have taken it for months report sustained improvements in digestion, energy, and skin clarity—without any negative effects. Why No Serious Side Effect Complaints Exist It’s rare for a supplement to have thousands of satisfied customers and no widespread complaints—but Prime Biome is one of those rare products. Most “side effects” reported are mild, short-lived, and linked to the gut adjustment phase, which resolves itself within a few days. Unlike synthetic supplements that lead to jitteriness, dependency, or digestive distress, Prime Biome works with your body, not against it. Additionally, because Prime Biome is only sold through the official website, customers receive fresh, verified bottles that are properly stored and handled. This prevents issues that occur with fake supplements sold through third-party retailers. With a 60-day money-back guarantee, GMP certification, FDA compliance, and real scientific backing, Prime Biome sets the gold standard for probiotic safety. >>Don’t take risks with your health—choose the safest gut-skin supplement today. Why Prime Biome Works Better Than Traditional Probiotic Supplements The probiotic supplement market is flooded with products that promise to restore gut balance, but very few deliver real, measurable benefits. Most probiotics are either too weak, unstable, or incapable of surviving the harsh environment of the digestive tract. This is where Prime Biome sets itself apart. Unlike generic probiotic pills that contain a few bacterial strains with questionable survival rates, Prime Biome’s advanced gut-skin formulation ensures that beneficial bacteria reach the intestines and provide real, lasting results. Most probiotic supplements suffer from a low bioavailability problem—the bacteria they contain often fail to survive stomach acid and bile. This means that by the time they reach the intestines, where they are needed most, only a fraction of the probiotics remain active. Prime Biome’s unique blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and skin-supporting botanicals ensures that its beneficial bacteria are delivered in a stable, bioavailable form. Ingredients like B. Coagulans, a robust probiotic strain, form protective spores that allow them to withstand stomach acid, ensuring that they reach the gut intact. Another major flaw of traditional probiotics is that they often lack prebiotic fibers, which are essential for feeding and sustaining beneficial bacteria. Without these nutrients, probiotics can struggle to colonize the gut effectively. Prime Biome includes high-quality prebiotics such as Inulin and Fenugreek to nourish the good bacteria, allowing them to multiply and thrive. This powerful synergy between prebiotics and probiotics leads to better digestion, reduced bloating, and enhanced skin clarity. Additionally, Prime Biome doesn’t just stop at gut health—it directly supports skin regeneration and cellular renewal. Many probiotic supplements fail to consider the gut-skin axis, which plays a crucial role in overall health and appearance. By including herbal extracts like Babchi, Lemon Balm, and Organic Lion’s Mane, Prime Biome ensures that the gut microbiome remains balanced while also promoting a clearer, more youthful complexion. >> Want to see why Prime Biome is outperforming traditional probiotics? Learn more about its unique formulation here. How Prime Biome Supports Weight Loss Through Gut Health Optimization Many people struggle with stubborn weight gain, bloating, and digestive sluggishness without realizing that an imbalanced gut microbiome is one of the biggest hidden obstacles to fat loss. Prime Biome works by restoring gut health, which in turn optimizes metabolism, reduces inflammation, and enhances nutrient absorption—all of which play a direct role in weight management. Scientific research has shown that the composition of gut bacteria significantly affects how the body stores fat and regulates appetite. When harmful bacteria outnumber beneficial bacteria, it can lead to increased fat storage, insulin resistance, and an inability to efficiently break down and absorb nutrients. Prime Biome counteracts this by replenishing the gut with beneficial strains like B. Coagulans, which help break down food more efficiently and support a healthier metabolic rate. Inflammation is another major contributor to slow metabolism and stubborn fat retention. Chronic inflammation disrupts hormonal balance, increases cravings, and makes weight loss an uphill battle. The anti-inflammatory properties of Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm in Prime Biome help to soothe the digestive system, reduce bloating, and promote better metabolic function. By calming gut inflammation, these ingredients allow the body to burn fat more efficiently while keeping energy levels stable. Another overlooked factor in weight gain is poor digestion leading to bloating and water retention. Many people mistake digestive bloating for weight gain when, in reality, their gut is simply struggling to break down food properly. Prime Biome contains powerful digestive-supporting herbs like Slippery Elm Bark and Fennel, which improve gut motility, reduce water retention, and ensure that nutrients are absorbed efficiently rather than being stored as excess fat. The Little-Known Link Between Gut Health and Hormonal Balance While most people associate gut health with digestion, very few realize just how deeply the gut microbiome impacts hormonal balance. The microbiome plays a critical role in regulating cortisol (stress hormone), insulin (blood sugar regulation), and estrogen (reproductive health)—all of which influence metabolism, mood, and even skin clarity. Prime Biome’s carefully formulated blend of probiotics and herbal adaptogens directly supports hormonal balance, leading to improved metabolic function, reduced stress, and clearer skin. One of the most damaging effects of an imbalanced gut is elevated cortisol levels, which can lead to stress-induced weight gain, poor digestion, and breakouts. When stress hormones spike, they trigger inflammation throughout the body, including the gut and skin. Prime Biome helps regulate cortisol by including adaptogenic herbs like Lemon Balm and Organic Lion’s Mane, which promote relaxation, reduce stress-related inflammation, and support a stable gut environment. Insulin resistance is another major consequence of poor gut health, often leading to blood sugar spikes, cravings, and increased fat storage. Beneficial bacteria are responsible for breaking down dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help regulate insulin sensitivity and prevent glucose spikes. Prime Biome’s combination of prebiotics and probiotics ensures that the gut microbiome is functioning optimally, preventing insulin resistance and promoting better blood sugar control. For women, hormonal imbalances related to estrogen metabolism can significantly impact skin, weight, and mood. The gut plays a crucial role in processing and eliminating excess estrogen, and when the microbiome is disrupted, it can lead to estrogen dominance—causing bloating, acne, mood swings, and stubborn fat accumulation. By restoring microbial balance, Prime Biome helps the body regulate estrogen naturally, reducing these symptoms and promoting a healthier hormonal environment. What Makes Prime Biome’s Ingredients So Powerful? A Deep Dive Into the Science Unlike generic probiotic supplements that rely on a limited number of bacterial strains, Prime Biome is formulated with a comprehensive blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and botanical extracts—each chosen for its scientifically backed ability to promote gut and skin health. This multi-layered approach ensures that every ingredient works in synergy to optimize digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and support overall well-being. B. Coagulans, the probiotic powerhouse, is one of the most resilient bacterial strains, capable of surviving stomach acid and colonizing the gut effectively. Studies have shown that B. Coagulans reduces bloating, supports immune function, and enhances nutrient digestion. Unlike many probiotic strains that require refrigeration, B. Coagulans remains stable at room temperature, making it more effective in supplement form. Babchi, the plant-based collagen booster, is a powerful antioxidant known for promoting skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and supporting cellular regeneration. This ingredient enhances collagen production, which is essential for maintaining firm, youthful skin. Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm play a dual role in reducing inflammation and supporting digestion. These ingredients improve gut motility, prevent bloating, and help break down food more efficiently, ensuring that the gut microbiome remains balanced and thriving. Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin act as natural prebiotics that fuel the growth of beneficial bacteria. They enhance gut barrier function, preventing toxins and harmful bacteria from entering the bloodstream, which is a major contributor to inflammation, acne, and digestive discomfort. By formulating Prime Biome with highly bioavailable, scientifically backed ingredients, the supplement delivers far superior results than standard probiotic capsules. Rather than simply replenishing bacteria, it creates an optimal gut environment where beneficial bacteria can thrive, repair gut lining, and restore digestive health—leading to better metabolism, clearer skin, and overall vitality. Final Verdict – Is Prime Biome the Missing Piece to Your Health? After analyzing the science, real customer experiences, and the unique formulation of Prime Biome, it’s clear that this isn’t just another probiotic supplement—it’s a complete gut and skin health solution designed to target the root cause of digestive imbalance, inflammation, and premature aging. Unlike traditional probiotics that focus solely on gut bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by integrating powerful botanicals, prebiotics, and clinically studied probiotics to restore the gut microbiome, support cellular renewal, and enhance skin clarity. With thousands of satisfied users, scientific backing, and a commitment to high-quality, non-GMO, GMP-certified ingredients, it’s no surprise that Prime Biome is quickly becoming the go-to choice for those looking to improve their digestion, energy levels, and overall well-being. If you’ve been struggling with bloating, sluggish digestion, persistent skin issues, or even stubborn weight gain, it’s likely that your gut microbiome is out of balance. Prime Biome offers a simple, scientifically backed way to correct these issues at their source, leading to long-term health improvements that extend beyond just digestion. With its doctor-formulated blend, positive customer feedback, and a risk-free 60-day money-back guarantee, there’s no reason to settle for less when it comes to your gut and skin health. Experience the transformative power of Prime Biome for yourself—your body will thank you.

This is at par with the industry expectations, especially at a time when economic instability persists. The decision follows the inflation trend which Fed expects to rise as well as the economic growth which is speculated to soften in the near future. Moreover, the ongoing tariff threats by Trump is expected to play a dampener for growth. In terms of gold, it is currently in a bullish phase, having the potential to scale new levels. Spot gold hits an all-time high of $3,051.99/oz. Fed is likely to resume rate cuts in June where it hinted two rate cuts in 2025. Hence, we reiterate our view of gold touching $3100 globally and INR 91,000 domestically.” InterGlobe Aviation's growth strategy attracts investors, with brokerages optimistic about future earnings and expansion plans.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to keep the policy rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range. In his speech, Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned that former U.S. President Donald Trump’s initial policies, such as import tariffs, have contributed to slower economic growth and may have had a temporary impact on inflation. Policymakers anticipate two rate cuts in 2025, with economic growth projected at 1.7% and inflation at 2.7% for the year. Additionally, the Fed plans to slow the pace of balance sheet reduction by adjusting the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities by April. Overall, this decision has mixed implications for currency movements, capital flows and market sentiment in India. Higher U.S. interest rates could lead to foreign capital outflows from Indian markets, whereas lower rates may attract investment. Additionally, economic uncertainty in the U.S. could contribute to market volatility. However, a stronger dollar may impact global commodity prices. As India is a major oil importer, lower oil prices could benefit the Indian stock markets.

While the Fed has multiple things to consider in its risk matrix, the Fed is charged with the twin goals of maintaining full employment and low prices. In the wake of heightened global uncertainty and increased business complexities stemming from President Donald Trump’s significant policy changes, the Fed held the rates steady. This was fully anticipated because “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased”. But “the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” In this disconcerting overarching environment, some analysts fear the dreaded specter of stagflation, which could be the worst of both worlds. The US Fed held the rates steady for a second straight meeting because of decelerating growth and persistently sticky inflation. Accordingly, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted on March 19, 2025, to keep the benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 4.25%-4.5%. The Fed announced a further scaling back of its “quantitative tightening” program in which it is slowly reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet. Governor Christopher Waller, who supported steady rates, dissented from the balance sheet decision. Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that tariff impacts are not amenable to prescient forecasts. Hence, there was a need for greater clarity on the impact of those policies on the economy before acting. The Fed forecasted two rate cuts for this year and expected the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation forecast, to rise to 2.8% in 2025, up from a prior forecast of 2.5%. It also expected GDP at 1.7% this year, down from the earlier forecast of 2.1%.

Additionally, the forecasts for both overall PCE inflation and core PCE inflation have been increased to 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively, up from 2.5%. These weakened macro projections suggest a more cautious economic outlook, which could influence monetary policy decisions moving forward. The market is reacting, with futures indicating a 62.1% probability that the Fed will resume rate cuts in the upcoming June meeting, reflecting a slight increase from the previous 57%. This shift signals trader sentiment that the Fed may need to take more accommodative steps to support the economy amid lower growth expectations and rising inflation concerns. The implications of these developments could lead to increased volatility in financial markets as investors recalibrate their strategies in response to the Fed’s evolving outlook.” Marksans Pharma announced that its manufacturing facility located at Plot A-1, Phase 1-A, Verna Industrial Estate, Verna, Goa has been approved by Australian TGA for manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations in Solid Dosage Forms of Tablets and hard Capsules for Australian markets.

This comes amid stagflation risks surged by US President Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, which escalated a global trade war. On other hand they expect Inflation to bounce back a little this year from a current rate of 2.5 % to 2.7 %, above the central bank’s 2 % target. By keeping rates unchanged, the Fed is balancing the need to combat inflation versus concerns about growth. This framework signals the Fed’s determination to achieve price stability as well as the flexibility it wishes to have to respond to future developments in the economy. HCL Tech (+1.63%), Wipro (+1.60%), TCS (+1.59%), Infosys (+1.43%) Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Ltd (“KMAMC” / “Kotak Mutual Fund”) today announced the launch of the “Choti SIP” facility, available for all eligible schemes of Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund. SEBI and AMFI recently introduced the Choti SIP (Small Ticket SIP), offering an opportunity to bring more Indians into the wealth creation journey. This initiative enables new investors to invest via SIP with a minimum amount of Rs. 250. The rationale behind “Choti SIP” (small Systematic Investment Plan) is to make mutual fund investments more accessible to a wider audience, particularly first-time investors, by lowering the entry barrier. The investor must not have previously invested in mutual funds (SIP or Lumpsum) at the industry level. The investor must invest in the Growth Option and commit to a minimum of 60 instalments on a monthly basis. The payment of instalments should be made through NACH or UPI auto-pay only. Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, KMAMC, said, “Only about 5.4 crore unique investors of India’s population are mutual fund investors—leaving a massive, untapped opportunity for penetration and bringing the Indian saver closer to financial freedom. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) have been an excellent way to bring new investors and kick-start their mutual fund journey. With the launch of Choti SIP, a new investor can begin their wealth creation journey with a minimum amount of Rs. 250. We can call it ‘Choti Rakam – Bada Kadam’.” PTC India has received the amount of ₹254 crores from ONGC Green Ltd. (OGL) as part of the adjustments to bid price as per Share Purchase Agreement.

Turkish Lira depreciates, potential risk for Jubilant Just the facts The Turkish Lira has depreciated 5% today with 8.5% depreciation YTD vs the USD. We note JUBI had acquire DP Eurasia in early 2024. DP Eurasia operates in in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia and contributed 31% of group system sales in 3QFY25. We note Jubilant Foodworks’ debt is Rs12.3bn as of Sep’24, of which we estimate about 80% is payable from Turkish cashflow. Analyst opinion We believe the depreciation of the Lira would lead to additional interest cost burden for JUBI in repayment of debt taken to acquire DP Eurasia. We believe the 5% Turkish Lira today could have a 2-2.5% impact on FY25 consolidated PAT estimates. The YTD Turkish Lira depreciation of 8.5% could have c.3.5-4% impact (including today’s impact) on FY25 consolidated PAT. This depreciation in Turkish Lira could also impact dividend payments by DP Eurasia.

The proposed incentive aims to address this by both enabling wider adoption and subsidizing the cost of payment systems.

At the outset, growth projections have been lowered and inflation has been falling, and therefore rate cuts by the Fed remain a continued possibility, despite the 1% reduction done last year. However, Mr Powel’s conundrum would be the same as everyone else:- the impact of President Trump’s unpredictable tariff moves. Tariffs are widely expected to adversely impact inflation and slow down the economy, but assessment of the impact of the same remains to be seen. US 10 yr rates have also gone down by ~20 bps over the last 1-2 mths. Majority of the market is expecting no rate changes in today’s policy by the Fed, however there’s still a possibility that the data driven Fed may cut rates acknowledging the slowing economic conditions and inflation trajectory.” Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company (EARC) has announced that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved its proposal to appoint Mythili Balasubramanian as the Interim Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately, till September 30th, 2025.

U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged as widely expected, and the central bank and investors continue to gauge how President Donald Trump’s tariff policies affect the economy and inflation. The central bank kept its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range, and indicated that two quarter-point interest-rate cuts were likely later this year, the same median forecast as three months ago. The Fed also forecast slower economic growth and higher inflation. Policymakers disagreed about the path forward, pointing to uncertainty among members about how to handle the effects of Trump’s plans. - Reuters Gold soared to a record high on Thursday, as the Federal Reserve hinted at a possible easing of interest rates by half a percentage point by year-end, which further fostered bullion’s appeal amid ongoing geopolitical and economic woes.

We present a series of charts under six sections: Growth/consumption, Investments, Financial Markets, Global Macros, Inflation/Employment, and External Sector. We wrap this up with a monthly tracker. ■ Barring a few outliers, we do not see signs of a meaningful growth/consumption recovery. Some data points like tractors and Port Cargo are improving, but major concurrent indicators like loan growth and auto sales continue to be weak. ■ Financial markets are mixed. Pressure on the rupee and forex is easing, with reserves stabilizing, the rupee weakness paused (at least for now), and the DXY having significantly corrected from the peak. Domestic liquidity however remains weak despite aggressive measures from the RBI – we see this as seasonal, and expect a recovery from Apr-25. ■ Our outlook is unchanged. We see an economic recovery in FY26 led by consumption – this will be enabled by a recovery in white collar employment and acceleration in retail lending. The investment cycle should moderate more toward normal levels, keeping pace with nominal GDP growth. We see the liquidity situation improving rapidly, leading to lower interest rates and better deposit growth. Interesting read of the week – Tokenization of private assets John Crabb discusses the possibilities of tokenization of private asset classes in Institutional Investor (link). This, he argues, will allow greater retail access to private markets, including alternate assets like art through fractionalization. Of course, this will need regulation changes from the SEC. Our view: giving retail investors access to illiquid private assets carries several unknown risks. The broader issue that resonates with India is that the options for domestic investors are now limited to the two ends of the spectrum – low-risk debt assets or equities/gold/real estate. There is a need for more products with intermediate risks that bridge this gap, as we discussed in our report on household savings in Dec-24 (link). Market view The market is showing signs of stability. As we mentioned last week (link), much of the valuation froth has subsided and most indices, including SMIDs, are trading below LTA P/Es. FPI selling has also abated. The sustainability of this rally will be determined by how well FY26 earnings forecasts hold up during the Apr-25 earning season. We believe that the Nifty EPSg forecast of 13.6% has little downside risk to it, fueled by a discretionary consumption recovery. In the short term, BFSI should outperform as liquidity easing and investors bottom-fish. In the medium term, however, we prefer consumer discretionary, healthcare and real estate. Capital markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday barred former TV anchor Hemant Ghai and his family members from the securities markets for five years for violating regulatory norms. Apart from the ban, Sebi has directed Hemant Ghai and his wife Jaya Ghai to disgorge the unlawful gains worth Rs 6.16 crore, along with 12 per cent interest per annum to be calculated from March 31, 2020, till the date of the interim order. It has also slapped a penalty of Rs 50 lakh each on Hemant Ghai and Jaya Ghai, Rs 30 lakh on MAS Consultancy Service, and Rs 5 lakh on financial services company Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL). The regulator had concluded that Hemant Ghai used his position as a TV anchor to influence stock prices, while his family members executed trades in advance to profit from the recommendations. “...Hemant Ghai had a huge following on social media and was closely followed on CNBC. The recommendations made by him influenced the investment decisions made by his viewers and impacted the price and volume of the recommended scrips. “However, he unfairly used this privilege to his own advantage,” Sebi’s whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia said in the order. In the final order, the regulator said, “A majority of trades and profits in the accounts of Jaya Ghai and Shyam Mohini Ghai stemmed from trades synchronised with stock recommendations made on CNBC by Hemant Ghai, husband and son, respectively, of the individuals in whose accounts the trades were executed”. Also, Sebi pointed out that Hemant has exercised operational control over these accounts, with his email, phone number, and bank credentials linked to them. - PTI Zinc futures outlook positive with resistance at ₹282, potential rally to ₹293; trade strategy suggests long positions. bl.portfolio Star Track Mutual Fund Ratings: A guide to achieving better returns in mutual funds Get intraday support, resistance levels, and trade recommendations for Nifty Futures and popular stocks with Day Trading Guide.

Title: Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk

"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream," says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y. Ben is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go – because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees. "I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness," he says. "There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement." Ben is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending. Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer. For some who do not share his views, it has all become too much. There have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal. Although most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire. In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps. US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as "domestic terrorism". Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. "This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong," he said in a recent interview with Fox News. "Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks." What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers. And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm? Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical. Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence. "Tesla was the pioneer," says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. "They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness." It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth. Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless "robotaxis". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus. Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts. But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges. Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million. The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down. This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February – although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% – as well as in Australia. Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month. In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day – adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year. Sales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y – with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada – although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets. In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: "Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago." Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales. But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO. To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market. "If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche," says Ms Valdez Streaty. "They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there." Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: "We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem." Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars. At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology. "China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs," says Ms Valdez Streaty. "You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well." The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes – significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network. Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles. In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time. In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's "Full Self Driving" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a "hands-on" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times. "Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from," says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy. Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket. Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded "with great difficulty". "It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk," says Prof Wells. "If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly." Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake – currently worth more than $95bn. That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes. For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation. Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings – a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth. "Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles – which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers – or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles," says Mr Nagley. None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment – although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down. But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. "A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now," says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. "It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand." "I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment." says Prof Wells. "I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business. "It needs a significant change of direction now."

Title: Nvidia, xAI and two energy giants join genAI infrastructure initiative
URL: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3849735/nvidia-xai-and-two-energy-giants-join-genai-infrastructure-initiative.html
Time Published: 2025-03-19T22:49:34Z
Full Content:
An industry generative artificial intelligence (genAI) alliance, the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), on Wednesday announced that xAI, Nvidia, GE Vernova, and NextEra Energy were joining BlackRock, Microsoft, and Global Infrastructure Partners as members. But given that the announcement specified no financial commitments or any other details, analysts doubted it would make much of a difference. Still, even though the massive global momentum behind genAI is unlikely to be changed by the announcement, the addition of the two energy companies to the group was an implicit acknowledgement that the ever-increasing power requirements of genAI data centers need serious attention. Scott Bickley, advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, said that the massive resources behind this initiative, including Blackrock, which reported in January that it held assets worth $11.6 trillion, making it the world’s largest money manager, can make the difference. “When deep pockets like Blackrock get involved at scale, it matters,” Bickley said. “This particular news release doesn’t specify any dollar amounts. However, we can infer from the players involved and the scale of AI investments that this will be a massive initiative that will move the needle in the AI infrastructure space.” Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen was more skeptical. “The problem is that this has all been done by PR. So what is real and what is true isn’t obvious, at least not to me. I think it changes nothing.” The statement from the group said it was changing its name from the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership to the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP). This initiative is not to be confused with another genAI effort called Stargate, which is backed by the US government and focuses on explicitly combatting China’s genAI efforts. The new AIP members will “further strengthen the partnership’s technology leadership as the platform seeks to invest in new and expanded AI infrastructure. Nvidia will also continue in its role as a technical advisor to AIP, leveraging its expertise in accelerated computing and AI factories to inform the deployment of next-generation AI data center infrastructure,” the group’s statement said. “Additionally, GE Vernova and NextEra Energy have agreed to collaborate with AIP to accelerate the scaling of critical and diverse energy solutions for AI data centers. GE Vernova will also work with AIP and its partners on supply chain planning and in delivering innovative and high efficiency energy solutions.” The group claimed, without offering any specifics, that it “has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September 2024, highlighting the growing demand for AI-ready data centers and power solutions.” The statement said the group will try to raise “$30 billion in capital from investors, asset owners, and corporations, which in turn will mobilize up to $100 billion in total investment potential when including debt financing.” Forrester’s Nguyen also noted that the influence of two of the new members — xAI, owned by Elon Musk, along with Nvidia — could easily help with fundraising. Musk “with his connections, he does not make small quiet moves,” Nguyen said. “As for Nvidia, they are the face of AI. Everything they do attracts attention.” Info-Tech’s Bickley said that the astronomical dollars involved in genAI investments is mind-boggling. And yet even more investment is needed — a lot more. “We are currently witnessing a generational level of investment in AI never seen before. Only the entities — sovereign wealth funds, major corporations, governments, hedge funds — can even play in this game,” Bickley said. “At the infrastructure level, this may parallel what we have seen in the 5G space, which has become the current standard for communications networks but has not lived up to expectations on performance and ROI. Investments in 5G have now eclipsed $700B, but has your cell phone experience changed materially over the past few years? Ultimately, these mega projects will be good for IT leaders and, in general, as they will facilitate energy infrastructure buildout, drive efficiencies and innovation, and ultimately make the core AI horsepower a commodity.” Evan Schuman has covered IT issues for a lot longer than he'll ever admit.

In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, BlackRock Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said the cryptocurrency industry has promoted the idea that Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, despite the fact the token is “global, scarce, non- sovereign, decentralized.” A risk-on asset is an investment such as a stock that poses at least some possibility of financial loss to investors. “What we've seen lately seems to be self- fulfilling and actually a self-inflicted wound by some of the research and commentary that the industry does, leaning into this idea of it as a risk- on asset at times,” Mitchnick told CNBC. U.S. regulators approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds exchange-traded funds early last year, widening institutional investors’ access to the world's oldest cryptocurrency. BlackRock’s application for a bitcoin ETF is widely considered a turning point in issuers’ efforts to win long-sought approval for these funds. BlackRock’s application for a bitcoin ETF is widely considered a turning point in issuers’ efforts to win long-sought approval for these funds. The ETFs now manage about $100 billion in assets with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) controlling $46.5 billion of that total. IBIT reached $10 billion assets faster than any fund in the ETF industry’s 32-year history. That rush of institutional dollars helped catapult Bitcoin to an all-time-high price of over $108,000 late last year. But, the asset's ever-volatile price has fallen more than 20% as investors wrestle with the effects of U.S. President Trump's aggressive tariff policies and the possibility of a recession in the U.S. The funds shed assets for five consecutive weeks amid this price downturn. Mitchnick argued that a steep economic downturn in the U.S. could affect Bitcoin's price “don't really make any sense at all.” “It's not clear that tariffs are a fundamental bad for Bitcoin,” Mitchnick said. “[As for] economic fears, I don't know if we have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin.” And while a potential hike in interest rates might negatively affect Bitcoin's value, the same would be for other asset classes, such as equities, according to Mitchnick. The executive also noted that, despite fears over the effect of macroeconomic uncertainties on the token, it is still up roughly 15% since the beginning of November. “Obviously, 2024 was pretty incredible, pretty historic,” he said. “That fundamentally, we think, is what the long term is. That's why people think of it like digital gold.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: BlackRock exec believes Bitcoin’s price does not reflect its strong institutional demand

BlackRock sees Bitcoin’s scarcity and independence as crucial in buffering against economic downturns. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Institutional investment in Bitcoin (BTC) has strengthened, but its price has struggled to reflect the growing demand, according to BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick. Despite continued adoption by large financial players, Bitcoin has experienced significant ETF outflows and cautious sentiment in early 2025, which have kept prices below previous highs. Mitchnick noted that short-term market behavior and macroeconomic uncertainty have slowed momentum despite optimism surrounding regulatory shifts in Washington initially drove gains, Speaking with Yahoo Finance on March 18, Mitchnick argued that Bitcoin’s fundamental characteristics — scarcity, decentralization, and independence from traditional monetary systems — position it as a strong hedge against economic downturns. He further suggested that a US recession could serve as a major catalyst for Bitcoin’s next rally. According to Mitchnick: “A recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin. It’s long liquidity, meaning it benefits from increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, and lower interest rates — all typical features of a recessionary environment.” Mitchnick highlighted that while gold has surged to record highs amid growing economic uncertainty, Bitcoin has not yet mirrored that trend. He attributed this divergence to Bitcoin’s short-term trading trends, where it is often treated as a risk-on asset rather than a store of value. Additionally, he explained that recent Bitcoin ETF outflows have been primarily driven by hedge funds unwinding spot-futures arbitrage trades rather than long-term investors exiting the market. He emphasizing that institutional confidence in Bitcoin remains strong despite short-term volatility, saying: “The core long-term holders are still in.” Mitchnick also weighed in on President Donald Trump’s move to establish a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, calling it a strong signal of support for BTC’s unique status within the digital asset space. However, he noted that the specifics of how the government plans to acquire and manage Bitcoin remain unclear, which does not help with the current uncertainty prevalent in the market. Mitchnick also indicated that institutional capital is still flowing into the market. He noted that professional investors appear to be taking advantage of the current dip, with many treating Bitcoin’s price weakness as an accumulation opportunity. He said: “Some of the most sophisticated Bitcoin accumulators we speak with are treating this dip as an opportunity.” Despite ongoing regulatory uncertainties and security concerns in the broader crypto industry, Mitchnick remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term role. He also argued that investors will increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial instability, potentially driving renewed momentum in the months ahead amid the uncertain economic landscape.

Title: Nvidia, xAI join $30B AI investment consortium backed by Microsoft
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/03/19/nvidia-xai-join-30b-ai-investment-consortium-backed-microsoft/
Time Published: 2025-03-19T22:18:47Z

UPDATED 18:18 EDT / MARCH 19 2025 by Maria Deutscher Nvidia Corp. and xAI Corp. have joined a consortium that plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The companies announced their decision to participate today. In conjunction, the consortium has renamed itself from Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership to AI Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP for short. AIP was launched last September by Microsoft Corp., BlackRock Inc. and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm. BlackRock’s recently acquired GIP subsidiary is also a founding backer. It’s an infrastructure-focused fund that operates assets such as data centers, wind farms and airports. The consortium’s initial goal is to invest more than $30 billion in AI projects. In the longer term, AIP hopes to raise as much as $100 billion from companies and other backers. The consortium disclosed today that the fund has “attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September.” Last year, Microsoft detailed that AIP plans to invest in data centers and energy infrastructure. The fund expects to invest the bulk of its capital in the U.S. Prior to the announcement that Nvidia is joining AIP, the chipmaker was a technical advisor to the consortium. Last year, it agreed to provide technical input on the AI data centers in which the fund will invest. Nvidia plans to continue providing technical advice going forward. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” said Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang. Separately, AIP’s backers today disclosed that GE Vernova Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. will also work with the consortium. GE Veronva is a supplier of energy generation equipment such as wind turbine engines. It spun off from General Electric Co. last year as part of the latter company’s split into three firms. According to BlackRock, GE Veronva will work with AIP and its partners on supply chain planning initiatives. NextEra Energy, the other company that will collaborate with the consortium, is the largest electric utility in the U.S. It’s the world’s top provider of wind energy. The utility will help “accelerate the scaling of critical and diverse energy solutions for AI data centers.” Several of AIP’s backers are also involved in other AI infrastructure investment initiatives. Last year, Microsoft partnered with utility Constellation Energy Generation LLC to reopen the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. The latter company will invest $1.6 billion to renovate the facility. After it comes online in 2026, the power plant will supply 835,000 megawatts of electricity for Microsoft data centers. Nvidia, meanwhile, is participating in OpenAI’s Stargate Project. The ChatGPT developer and its partners plan to build $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure in the U.S as part of the initiative .

As Elon Musk’s DOGE targets the Social Security Administration for cuts and reorganization, the agency is rolling out new rules for benefit recipients that could spur chaos and dysfunction at the agency. This week, the agency announced that it will no longer allow new benefit recipients to verify their identities over the phone. Instead, those participants will either have to use an online ID verification software or, if that doesn’t work, make a visit to a government field office to do it in person. Similarly, returning benefit recipients who want to update their direct deposit information will either have to pass the online ID verification process or visit a government office. “The Social Security Administration (SSA) is taking proactive steps to enhance the security of its services by implementing stronger identity verification procedures,” the agency said, in a press release published Tuesday. “SSA will permit individuals who do not or cannot use the agencyâs online ‘My Social Security’ services to start their claim for benefits on the telephone. However, the claim cannot be completed until the individualâs identity is verified in person. The agency therefore recommends calling to request an in-person appointment to begin and complete the claim in one interaction.” It’s unclear how well the government’s ID verification software works, though it’s worth noting that a Federal Communications Commission report published last year found that between 14 and 24 million Americans still lack access to broadband. A similar report from the AARP found that an estimated 42 percent of older adults (some 22 million people) lack reliable access to the internet. Many elderly Americans may not be “digital natives” and, even if they have internet access, may be bad at navigating websites and digital platforms. A Pew Research survey from 2021 showed that about a quarter of the U.S. population that is 65 or older (i.e., the people most likely to be on social security) report “never going online.” In other words, as the Associated Press has reported, the SSA’s policy shift is likely to force “millions of [social security] recipients and applicants” to visit government offices to get their retirement benefits. That’s really bad news because, as it happens, DOGE has also been targeting SSA field offices across the country for lease termination and closure. Currently, on DOGE’s website, it says that 47 offices across the country have been or will have their leases terminated. Those offices are spread across a variety of states, including many MAGA-heavy places like Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, and North Dakota. Problematically, DOGE has also been working to downsize the SSA’s staff. Indeed, the agency’s new DOGE-linked director reportedly announced plans to halve the agency’s staff in the coming months. It seems reasonable to assume that such a staff reduction would functionally decapitate the government’s ability to dispense benefits, especially at the field offices where recipients must now apparently show up to verify their identities. A recently unearthed memo seemed to show that the SSA’s own staff are aware that the new policies being put in place under the auspices of DOGE could effectively drive down service delivery and cause the agency to slide into dysfunction. The memo notes that the policy changes will create “increased field office traffic,” “longer call wait times,” and “delayed processing” among other negative outcomes. Americans should not be surprised by the policy changes ushered in under the watchful eye of Musk’s government “efficiency” organization. The billionaire has spoken about the program with open hostility, calling it a “Ponzi scheme.” The changes at Social Security also follow on the heels of comments made by Larry Fink, the CEO of mega-corporation BlackRock, who recently expressed interest in privatizing Social Security. “The problem we have now, we have a plan called Social Security that doesnât grow with the economy,” Fink said while speaking with Semafor. “If we create a plan that every American can grow with our economy, theyâre going to feel more attached to our economy,” Fink said, implying that Americans’ retirement funds should be tied up with the stock market.

Title: US spies urged to refocus efforts on America's backyard, new House Intel chair says

DEA assistant special agent in charge David Olesky joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss how Tren de Aragua has infiltrated the nation as the Trump administration cracks down on violent illegal aliens. The two-decade War on Terror in the Middle East has left America overlooking the security issues in its own neighborhood, at least according to the House’s new Intelligence Chair Rick Crawford, R-Ark. "We were so focused on the global war on terror, what that's done is opened up opportunities for countries like China," the Arkansas Republican told a small group of reporters as he laid out his priorities for the committee. "But even going back before China, you know, obviously the Russians have been very aggressive in the hemisphere, in particular in countries like Nicaragua, Cuba, Venezuela and elsewhere," Crawford added. "They’ve taken every opportunity to try to carve out a niche of influence in areas… in our backyard." GABBARD ANNOUNCES CRACKDOWN ON INTELLIGENCE LEAKS The two-decade War on Terror in the Middle East has left America overlooking the security issues in its own neighborhood, at least according to the House’s new Intelligence Chair Rick Crawford. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration has pushed a new Monroe Doctrine-like focus, most notably with Trump calling for the U.S. to take back the Panama Canal from China. That call was answered with a deal for U.S.-based BlackRock to take over two ports of entry to the canal from Hong Kong-based C.K. Hutchison. Now, Chinese authorities are threatening to thwart that deal. As China increasingly threatens U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific, Crawford believes the U.S. could win a war with the Chinese if it needed to — for now. "But we don’t have a lot of time. We can’t sit back and ponder the situation much more." China and Russia are aggressively testing offensive capabilities in space, Pentagon officials have said, while China-watchers warn the CCP is ahead of the U.S. in shipbuilding capabilities, hypersonics, anti-ship ballistic missiles, cyber and is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal. Crawford said the U.S. may need to rethink its policy from a focus that leans heavily on cybersecurity to one that considers offensive attacks. As China increasingly threatens U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific, Crawford believes the U.S. could win a war with the Chinese if it needed to — for now. (Andy Wong/AP Photo) Crawford’s predecessor, former committee Chair Mike Turner, fired off an ominous public warning calling on President Joe Biden to declassify information about a threat that was later reported to be Russian anti-satellite capabilities. That warning and the public scare it caused later factored into Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to replace Turner as head of the committee in January, sources familiar with the situation have told Fox News Digital. Crawford’s views also fell closer in line with those of Trump than Turner’s. Asked if he shared Turner’s concern, Crawford said: "Everything that Russia does is a concern to me as it applies to, you know, their belligerent behavior, the potential that they have." "The reason they punch above their weight is, I mean, they have a GDP about the size of Spain. It's not that they're a huge economy, it's that they're willing to do things that other countries aren't, and they're willing to be belligerent. They're willing to invade their neighbor, and that's a problem." RUBIO THREATENS VENEZUELA WITH NEW SANCTIONS Venezuela, whose dictatorial leader Nicolas Maduro is backed by China, Russia and Iran, has claimed swaths of Guyanese territory as its own. (Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Reuters) It’s a different message than one might expect to hear from a Trump-aligned Republican, amid a thawing in U.S.-Russia relations as Trump tries to negotiate peace between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. "[Russia’s] willingness to do things that most civilized nations wouldn’t do puts them in a unique category," Crawford said. "So let’s engage in trying to end the hostilities in Ukraine, bring that to a peaceful end to the extent that we can. But, you know, as Reagan said, trust, but verify." Crawford also said that the intelligence community [IC] needed a "retooling of the culture" to address recruitment and retention issues. He called the IC’s handling of the Havana Syndrome a "slap in the face" to its sufferers. The IC’s assessment that Havana Syndrome, also known as anomalous health incidents (AHI) was likely not the work of a foreign adversary "missed the mark grossly." "If we've got problems with recruiting and retention because the workforce doesn’t think the seventh floor [where leadership sits] has their back, that's a real problem for national security." Crawford continued: "If analytic integrity or lack of is driving that, that's something we're going to have to pay close attention to. And we're going to exercise rigorous oversight." In December, Crawford's CIA subcommittee released a report finding it "increasingly likely" a foreign adversary had been behind a number of the anomalous health incidents, and that the IC's assessment finding just the opposite "was developed in a manner inconsistent with analytic integrity and thoroughness." Trump officials have repeatedly stressed that this administration will put renewed attention on the Western Hemisphere, with an eye for what Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls "missed opportunities and neglected partners." (Mark Schiefelbein/Reuters) Trump officials have repeatedly stressed that this administration will put renewed attention on the Western Hemisphere, with an eye for what Secretary of State Marco Rubio calls "missed opportunities and neglected partners." Crawford added that the U.S. needed to hold close to its relationship with Guatemala. "Guatemala is probably our best ally in the hemisphere," he said. "They want to be a partner. There are others where we see some great opportunity — Guyana and Suriname are sort of beneficiaries of some huge mineral wealth that has developed in the last four or five years." Venezuela, whose dictatorial leader Nicolas Maduro is backed by China, Russia and Iran, has claimed swaths of Guyanese territory as its own. The U.S., which does not recognize Maduro's regime, removed sanctions loopholes for Venezuelan oil in January, and threatened to ramp up financial penalties even further if Maduro will not accept deported migrants. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For the U.S.'s northern neighbor, Crawford believes the current quarrel with Canada over tariffs and Trump suggesting it become the 51st U.S. state will quiet down due to the important national security partnership.

Title: South Korea just opened its largest EV charging hub
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/03/19/south-korea-just-opened-its-largest-ev-charging-hub/
Time Published: 2025-03-19T19:33:24Z
Full Content:
South Korea just got its largest outdoor EV fast-charging hub, and it’s at the Korea International Exhibition Center (KINTEX) in Goyang. The new hub, built by charging network Water, features 46 fast chargers capable of juicing up everything from electric cars to buses and trucks. KINTEX hosts around 5.8 million visitors a year, so a major charging hub like this makes a lot of sense. Water installed eight 200 kW and 38 100 kW EV chargers. The station is split across two sections of an outdoor parking lot near Exhibition Center 2. Drivers can easily access the chargers from Ilsan Lake Park, and there are no height restrictions, meaning electric buses and trucks won’t have to struggle to find a compatible spot. The hub is also topped with Water’s signature wooden canopy, which not only makes it easier to spot but also lowers the construction carbon footprint compared to steel or concrete structures. Dongyoon Lee, Water’s director of business development, says the 46 chargers eliminate the hassle of hunting for multiple stations and provide a one-stop fast-charging experience. Even during peak hours, wait times should be minimal. KINTEX has nearly 7,000 parking spaces, and South Korean regulations require that at least 5% of spaces at large public venues be designated for EV charging. This new hub goes above and beyond that requirement, which is especially needed as KINTEX expands and some parking areas close. The project is part of a broader push to improve Goyang’s green infrastructure. Water was chosen last April to install 107 chargers across 14 locations in the city, and the entire network is expected to be up and running by the end of the month. Daewon Yu, managing partner at Water, calls KINTEX a prime location for charging infrastructure and notes that “the hub will also support green mobility initiatives in Goyang by serving EV owners, taxis, buses, and other commercial vehicles.” Water is the EV charging network brand of Brite Energy Partners, a South Korean renewable energy infrastructure company backed by BlackRock.

Title: Building Scalable Synthetic Data Generation Pipelines for Perception AI with Databricks and NVIDIA Omniverse

Published: March 19, 2025 by Josh Melton, Zachary Jacobson, Jacob Kranzler, Niko Dyundev, David Rogers, Shiv Trisal, Mayank Tahilramani (NVIDIA) and Joel Caruso (NVIDIA) Share this post Keep up with us The NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks Data Intelligence Platform integration combines synthetic data creation with enterprise AI capabilities in a simple-to-deploy, easy-to-maintain architecture. With NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator, Databricks users can leverage high-fidelity, physics-accurate simulations to parameterize synthetically generated data for vision model training. Training AI models for real-world applications require vast amounts of labeled data, which can be costly, time-consuming, and difficult to obtain at scale. Synthetic data generation in simulated environments offers a powerful alternative by enabling AI models to learn from physically accurate, controlled, and scalable virtual datasets before deployment. Leveraging Omniverse Replicator, a core extension of Isaac Sim, a reference robotic simulation application, with the Databricks’ Data Intelligence Platform provides an end-to-end workflow for developing domain-specific AI models in industries like manufacturing, logistics, healthcare diagnostics, and robotics. By combining synthetic data generation, automated AI workflows, and scalable cloud infrastructure, organizations can accelerate AI development while reducing data acquisition challenges and improving model accuracy. This blog explores the technical foundations of this integration, real-world applications, and demonstrates how the collaboration between Databricks and NVIDIA is supercharging machine vision applications. By fusing Databricks’ Data Intelligence Platform with NVIDIA’s unparalleled high-performance computing, enterprises can now build, train, and deploy vision models at speeds previously thought impossible. This blog explores the technical foundations of this integration and its real-world applications. The technical foundations of the integration start with a reference architecture that defines interfaces, data models, and communication protocols. Below is a generalized workflow that demonstrates the integration of applications developed with NVIDIA Omniverse and the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform to provide an end-to-end AI model training pipeline. The steps within the workflow are as follows: Within this architecture, Delta Lake is used as the integration layer between NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks. We bridge the two platforms by leveraging a prototype, custom writer, which allows an application developed with Omniverse to write synthetic data directly into the Lakehouse. Using this approach, instead of writing the data to disk in the form of PNG and NumPy files, Omniverse powered applications can write the generated synthetic images and corresponding metadata into Delta Lake format. The files land directly into cloud storage and are registered to Unity Catalog where they are further processed using Databricks so they are available for downstream model training. The NVIDIA Omniverse and Databricks integration establishes a new paradigm for machine vision development encompassing synthetic data generation and easy-to-use, industrial-grade AI. Within manufacturing environments, defect detection models often encounter three primary challenges: identifying new defects, adapting to new products, and performing in diverse real-world environments. To tackle these challenges, the NVIDIA Omniverse platform enables customers to build custom synthetic generation pipelines. NVIDIA Omniverse enables developers to create entirely new camera angles, lighting conditions, and physical scenarios in their applications, significantly enhancing model robustness and adaptability beyond traditional methods, such as rotating or brightening images. By automating image generation, the synthetic data generation process becomes a tunable parameter within Databricks’ Managed MLflow. These adjustments can be made alongside traditional hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size. As you identify which variations impact model accuracy, you can refine your training approach to focus on the most effective combinations of synthetic data and hyperparameters while minimizing time spent on less productive configurations. By having synthetic data as a tunable parameter, new use cases are unlocked for manufacturers without disrupting actual operations: These approaches enable manufacturers to train a broader variety of machine vision models to solve business problems proactively. Rare defects with data that was previously too sparse to train on can now be augmented with numerous realistic examples, allowing businesses to catch defects before they escape while preparing enterprises for the new age of Data Intelligence. Siemens Healthineers, a joint healthcare customer of Databricks and NVIDIA inspired this integration architecture after experiencing challenges. The fragmented workflow—with one engineer generating synthetic data through an application developed with NVIDIA Omniverse on-premises and another moving that data to the cloud for ML training and deployment in Databricks—created delays. By implementing Databricks Unity Catalog to centralize all data, functions, and models under a single governance framework and directly integrating the Omniverse platform’s synthetic data generation capabilities, the organization dramatically reduced model iteration cycles "from weeks to days," improved data integration and traceability, and accelerated time to market.

Thousands of attendees packed into a hockey arena in San Jose, Calif. yesterday (March 18) to hear from Jensen Huang kick off Nvidia (NVDA)’s annual developer conference, GTC. Dubbed the “Super Bowl of A.I.” by the CEO, the event’s audience also included the grandchildren of Vera Rubin, a famed astronomer for whom Nvidia’s upcoming GPU architecture is named. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Naming chips after prominent scientists has been a decades-long tradition at Nvidia. Following its upcoming Rubin GPUs, set for release in late 2026, the company plans to introduce a successor architecture named after theoretical physicist Richard Feynman, Huang revealed yesterday. The in-production Blackwell chip, unveiled at last year’s GTC, is named for mathematician David Blackwell. Since 1998, Nvidia has drawn naming inspiration from computer scientists, mathematicians, astronomers and physicists since 1998. These scientific figures are such a core part of Nvidia’s culture that their faces appear on employee-only company merchandise labeled with the names of Nvidia’s “heroes.” Early architectures took cues from icons like Nikola Tesla and Johannes Kepler, while more recent product lines have spotlighted women in science, including GPUs named after Vera Rubin, Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace. Here’s a closer look at some of the scientists who have been honored by the chipmaking giant over the past few years: Contributions to quantum electrodynamics were among the many accomplishments of Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist who died in 1988 at age 69. He received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for his efforts in the field. Feynman additionally worked on the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, during World War II. Most of the American public, however, first became aware of the scientist when he served on a presidential commission investigating the 1986 explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. Vera Rubin is most well-known for having provided evidence for the existence of dark matter in the universe. Working alongside astronomer Kent Ford in the 1960s, the duo came across the discovery after studying more than 60 galaxies. A pioneering female astronomer, Rubin was the first woman to serve as scientist staffer at the Carnegie Institution’s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism and in 1993 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. She died in 2016 at age 88. Nvidia’s sought-after Blackwell chips were inspired by David Blackwell, a mathematician and statistician who died in 2010 at age 91. In addition to groundbreaking contributions to game theory, probability theory and information theory, Blackwell penned one of the first-ever textbooks on Bayesian statistics in 1969. He also set milestones in the science community, becoming the first Black scholar to be admitted to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965. He was also the first Black professor to receive tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, and joined the school’s faculty in the 1950s. Nvidia’s Hopper chips, announced in 2022 and more commonly referred to as its H100 GPUs, took its name from computer scientist and naval officer Grace Hopper. She notably worked on Mark I, America’s first electromechanical computer, and the subsequent Mark II and Mark III computers during her time in the Navy. Appointed a Rear Admiral in the 1980s, she was the oldest officer on active duty when she retired in 1986. After leaving the Navy, Hopper worked for the Digital Equipment Corporation until her death in 1992 at age 85. She received the National Medal of Technology from President George Bush the year prior for her contributions to computer programming languages. When it came to naming its Ada architecture three years ago, Nvidia went back to the 19th-century to draw inspiration from the 1800s mathematician Ada Lovelace. The daughter of British poet Lord Byron, Lovelace—who died in 1843 at age 36—is often recognized as the world’s first computer programmer. Some of her most notable work occurred in 1843, when Lovelace added a set of notes to a translated academic article that laid out what many consider to be the first computer program. Her contributions were rediscovered in the late 1970s, leading the U.S. Department of Defense to name the Ada programming language after her.

Title: Tesla gets approval to start offering robotaxi rides in California as stock bounces back
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/03/19/business/tesla-gets-approval-to-start-offering-rides-in-california/
Time Published: 2025-03-19T18:44:46Z
Full Content:
Tesla moved one step closer to its goal of operating a fleet of autonomous robotaxis on Tuesday when California regulators granted Elon Musk’s electric car maker a license to begin offering rides in the state. The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit “does not authorize them to provide rides” in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public. Instead, the limited license issued by the California Public Utilities Commission grants Tesla permission to transport its employees using Tesla-owned vehicles on a prearranged basis. Tesla’s stock — which has been hammered with weeks of punishing losses that have slashed its value by nearly half — rose by nearly 4% as of 1:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. While this authorization is an initial move toward Tesla’s long-term goal of deploying a fleet of self-driving cars, it is just one of many approvals the company will need before the technology will be available to the public in California. Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, remains the only company offering autonomous rides to the public in California. Its erstwhile competitor, Cruise, previously offered self-driving taxi services primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area, but a series of accidents involving the vehicles prompted state regulators to suspend its permit in late 2023. More than a year later, Cruise’s parent company General Motors decided to discontinue its investment in the robotaxi program after spending over $10 billion since acquiring it in 2016. Tesla has long been seen as a potential major contender in the autonomous vehicle industry. Musk has expressed confidence in the financial impact of robot taxis, stating that they could add trillions of dollars to Tesla’s market valuation. Despite optimism over the company’s autonomous driving ambitions, Tesla’s stock has faced recent struggles. Tesla was the beneficiary of a post-election “Trump bump” when its stock price soared to an all-time high of almost $480 per share in mid-December. But Musk’s active role in slashing the federal bureaucracy and his proximity to President Trump as well as his touting of far-right parties in Europe have put a dent in the company’s sales. Since mid-December, Tesla’s stock has lost nearly 60% of its value. As of Wednesday afternoon, it was trading at around $235 per share. Musk’s embrace of MAGA politics has also sparked a rash of vandalism and arson attacks against Tesla vehicles and car dealerships nationwide in recent weeks. In October, the company unveiled a prototype of its anticipated autonomous vehicle, which Musk refers to as a “Cybercab.” Just a month later, Tesla submitted an application for the newly granted ride service permit. However, the company has not yet applied for the additional regulatory approvals necessary to operate a commercial robot taxi service in the state. Musk has suggested that Texas could be the first location where Tesla deploys its robot taxis — with a potential launch as early as June. Unlike California, Texas has relatively relaxed regulations surrounding autonomous vehicles, making it a more favorable environment for initial testing. In December 2021, Tesla officially moved its corporate headquarters from Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas, after Musk bitterly criticized California regulators for imposing closures on factories during the pandemic. Waymo has already introduced its own self-driving taxis to the public in Austin this month, signaling increasing competition in the sector. For Tesla to legally operate autonomous taxis on public roads in California, the company must obtain additional approvals from both the CPUC and the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. The CPUC oversees ride-for-hire services like Uber and Lyft while the DMV is responsible for evaluating vehicle safety — a significant regulatory hurdle for any company seeking to introduce self-driving technology. Tesla has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny over its safety record — particularly as it pertains to its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology. Last fall, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation after an incident in which a Tesla driver who had been using FSD — the advanced driver assistance system that enables semi-autonomous driving on highways and city streets — struck and killed a pedestrian.

Title: Notebooks as reusable Python programs

Time Published: 2025-03-19T18:14:14Z
Full Content:
We've launched our YouTube channel! Subscribe for tutorials and demos. Akshay @akshaykagrawal Myles @themylesfiles Dylan Madisetti @dmadisetti marimo is free and open source, available on GitHub. This blog post is also accompanied by a YouTube video. In a previous post, on lessons learned redesigning the Python notebook, we wrote: A lot of important work happens in notebooks — research, large scale experimentation, data engineering, and more. But this kind of work should be treated as Python software, and it shouldn’t be done in error-prone JSON scratchpads. In that post we described design decisions that allowed us to create a new kind of notebook (marimo), one that blended the best parts of interactive computing with the maintainability, reusability, and interoperability of software. Part of our solution was to represent notebooks as Python programs — not just as flat scripts, but as reusable modules. In this post, we dive deep into our representation of notebooks as Python files — showing how our file format makes notebooks versionable with Git, importable as modules, testable with pytest, executable as scripts, and much, more, while still being compatible with other languages like SQL and Markdown. We also discussing how we design around tradeoffs, such as keeping a record of visual outputs. Contents The status quo is not working Python, not JSON: a new plaintext file format Anatomy of a notebook file Examples Version with Git Test with pytest Test with doctests Reuse functions and classes in other Python files Reuse cells and notebooks in other notebooks Run as Python scripts Script metadata for packaging and configuration Embed SQL and Markdown Edit as plaintext files Output storage It just works AI developers, data engineers, data scientists, and researchers do a lot of their work in Python notebooks like Jupyter. We know this from first-hand experience; we’ve worked as engineers at Google Brain and Palantir, and lived in notebooks, for better or worse, during PhDs at Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Traditional notebooks’ usefulness is severely limited by the JSON-based ipynb file format (among other things). This file format combines code and outputs in what Pydantic creator Samuel Colvin calls a “horrid blob”, and is directly responsible for the following sad state of affairs: While it’s true that you can get cleaner diffs by using Jupytext (if you’re sufficiently motivated) or Databricks source notebooks (if you’re a paying customer), naively storing notebooks as flat Python scripts like these tools do won’t solve the other problems enumerated above. In particular, importing a Jupytext-processed or Databricks source-format notebook as a module will also run all its cells — a potentially very expensive side-effect if all you wanted was to import a function or class. nbdev is a framework that lets developers “write, test, document, and distribute software packages and technical articles” using Jupyter notebooks, a goal that we consider orthogonal to our goal of making a new kind of Python notebook that is a simple software artifact, just like any other Python file. We are not interested in replacing traditional software development with notebooks. When working with Jupyter, too often you end up with directories strewn with spaghetti-code notebooks, counting up to Untitled12.ipynb or higher. You the notebook author don’t know what’s in these notebooks, you don’t understand their Git history, you don’t know what packages were used in each notebook, you haven’t tested anything because how do you even test notebooks, and you’re unsure if you — let alone your colleagues — will be able to run them in the future. Despite these problems (and others — by one study, less than four percent of Jupyter notebooks on GitHub are reproducible), people continue using traditional notebooks for production tasks like pipelines (e.g., Databricks workflows), as well as areas where reproducibility is paramount, like AI development and science. Why? Because, until recently, Jupyter notebooks were the only programming environment that let you see your data while you worked on it. Interactivity is so crucial to data work that hundreds of thousands of data professionals decided the trade-offs were worth it. Instead of accepting this sad state of affairs, or trying to work around it with clunky extensions or complicated frameworks, we decided it was worth it to reinvent notebooks as regular Python programs — we wanted to make something that just worked. It was from this belief that the marimo notebook was born. marimo stores notebooks as plaintext Python files (e.g. notebook.py) with the following properties: After a lot of careful consideration, we landed on files that look like this: This file format encodes how data flows across the notebook: as we explained in our previous post, marimo represents notebooks as dataflow graphs to improve reproducibility (eliminating hidden state) and enable seamless interactivity with UI elements. marimo automatically generates notebook files on save from the marimo editor, but developers can also create or edit these files in their text editor of choice (ours are neovim and Cursor). Header. The notebook file starts with a header that imports marimo, notes the version of marimo that created the file, and instantiates an App object to which cells are added. Cells. Cells are stored in notebook presentation order. Each cell is serialized as a function that accepts its variable references and return its definitions; cells are added to the notebook via the app.cell decorator. Users can optionally name their cells, which become the names of the decorated functions. This serialization strategy departs from Jupytext-style (or Databricks-style) flat scripts, which demarcate cells with comments instead of wrapping them in functions. Importing Jupytext or Databricks notebook files runs all their cells, which is expensive and almost never what you want. In contrast, in our file format, cells are not executed on import because they are wrapped in functions. Functions and classes. This part of our notebook specification is slated for release in version 0.12.0. Cells that define top-level functions or classes are serialized directly in the file, so they can be reused by other Python modules (from my_notebook import my_function). An optional top-level setup cell, not shown here, can make symbols available to these functions, such as imported modules and constants. Footer. An if __name__ == "__main__" guard protects a call to app.run(), which executes the notebook’s cells in a topologically sorted order. Our simple file format makes it possible to treat notebooks like any other Python program. Here are some examples of what our file format enables: Version with Git Test with pytest Test with doctests Reuse functions and classes in other Python files Reuse cells and notebooks in other notebooks Run as Python scripts Script metadata for packaging and configuration Embed SQL and Markdown Edit as plaintext files Small changes to notebook code are guaranteed to make small localized changes to the notebook file, yielding easy-to-read Git diffs. For example, consider a one character change, modifying to marimo notebook diff. Here’s the Git diff for a marimo notebook file: It corresponds exactly to the code change, with the notebook file changed in just one place. Jupyter notebook diff. In contrast, because ipynb files stores base64-encoded blobs of outputs, the diff for the equivalent Jupyter notebook contains 42,571 characters. Moreover, the notebook contains many changes unrelated to the actual single character code change. Here is an abbreviated version of the diff, with truncated blobs. Not only are these diffs impossible to read for an individual, they also make resolving merge conflicts very difficult. Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, they are interoperable with other tools for Python — including pytest. In contrast, there is no standard way to test code in Jupyter notebooks, which is part of the reason why so many traditional notebooks fall over from incorrectness. Testing cells. Any cell named as test_* is automatically discoverable and testable by pytest. The same goes for any cell that contains only test_ functions and Test classes. Importantly, because cells are wrapped in functions, running pytest test_notebook.py doesn’t execute the entire notebook — just its tests. Example. Consider running pytest on the following code: This prints: marimo also supports doctest out of the box: just call doctest.testmod() in your notebook, in a cell that references the functions you’d like to test. This can be especially helpful when defining and documenting functions in marimo notebooks that will be used elsewhere. Coming soon, in version 0.12.0. Our file format also makes it easy and natural to reuse functions and classes defined in your notebook; just import them like you would from a regular notebook file: This works for cells that have just a single function definition or class definition. Additionally, the functions and classes must have no other references other than imported modules or other symbols that you the notebook author define in a special setup cell (functions and classes can also refer to other top-level functions). For example, the below notebook contains a setup cell that imports numpy, and a cell that defines a function that uses numpy. Unlike other cells, the setup cell’s body is at the top-level of the file (it’s not wrapped in a function), so its variables are made available to the notebook’s functions. You can define the setup cell by simply editing the notebook file in a text editor, or through the marimo editor. Cells. Named cells can be used in other notebooks: Here, defs is a dictionary containing the variables the cell defines, and output the value of the cell’s last expression (i.e., its visual output). By default, running a cell in this way will also run its ancestors. The run method can be parametrized to override the values of its references and prevent ancestor execution. (This API was inspired by Observable notebooks.) See our docs for an example. Notebooks. Entire notebooks can be embedded in other notebooks: This lets you reuse the user interface of a marimo notebook as a component (since marimo makes it easy for notebooks to be rendered as interactive web apps). Our docs include a usage example. Every marimo notebook can be run as a script; This runs the notebook cells in a topologically sorted order. You can also pass command-line arguments to your notebook, which can be read with the library function marimo.cli_args(): Since marimo notebooks are just Python, you can also use argparse to declare and parse arguments. And, since marimo does not support magic commands (we don’t need them), your notebook is guaranteed to work as as script. Thanks to PEP 723, there is now an agreed-upon Python specification for storing metadata in single-file Python scripts. This metadata is similar to a pyproject.toml and stored as a header comment, such as: Because marimo notebooks are just Python files, we can use this spec to communicate metadata to other tools in the Python ecosystem. Package requirements. For reproducibility, marimo users can document their notebook’s dependencies in script metadata. When given a notebook with inline dependencies, marimo uses uv to run it in an isolated virtual environment. marimo can even automatically maintain this dependency list on the user’s behalf. Configuration overrides. Users can use script metadata to easily override marimo configuration on a per-notebook basis. Even though marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python, other languages can be used by embedding them in Python. For example, marimo has native support for “SQL cells”, powered by DuckDB or other databases. Though the marimo editor renders these cells as SQL, under the hood they are represented as The marimo parser even statically analyzes SQL code to build a dataflow graph jointly across Python and SQL. Markdown is embedded in marimo notebooks in a similar way: As you can see above, a benefit of embedding other languages in Python is that it enables users to interpolate Python values into SQL and Markdown at runtime. As a final example, our plaintext format makes it easy to edit marimo notebooks in a text editor of your choice; marimo will pick up your changes and reflect them in the browser. The plaintext file format also means you can lint and format notebook files using your preferred tools. While you don’t need to maintain the cell arguments and returns, doing so can help your IDE provide completions. We have changes queued up that will make this feel like a first-class experience. Our file format has tradeoffs — in particular, storing as a Python file means that notebook outputs are no longer serialized in the notebook file. We accommodate output persistence in the following ways: We regularly get feedback from users telling us how much they appreciate marimo’s embrace of pure Python. For example, one user at a large company told us how marimo’s Python-first design means his notebooks are, for the first time, actually reusable and reproducible software artifacts: My colleagues used to ask me what I did to reach certain conclusions … I would just send them my Jupyter notebook, but rarely did it ever actually run properly without issue, and it was always a mystery what specific order I ran the cells in to get them to work. I would end up just redoing a lot of the analysis in pure Python to replicate what was done, which was so inefficient. marimo has definitely solved that issue. Others tell us they came for marimo’s interactivity, but stayed for the ability to run notebooks as scripts. Conversely, others tell us they came for git-versioning, or for the tight integration with uv, and stayed for reactive execution or rich dataframes. Here’s a quote from a user that speaks to this: I haven‘t touched Jupyter or Pandas for a while now and not regretting it. My basic data stack is now uv, polars, marimo. One of my favourite features is that the notebooks are pure Python files and integrate uv script headers to make them out-of-the-box executable. More generally, when we ask our users why they keep using marimo, we hear quotes like this one: Well it just works! It just works. While marimo was originally developed with input from Stanford scientists, it is now used by developers at dozens of companies across the world, including OpenAI, BlackRock, and Moderna; it is also used by researchers and educators at Berkeley, Stanford, NASA, CZI, and other institutions. marimo is quickly establishing itself as a new standard for interactive computing. The marimo package is downloaded hundreds of thousands of times a month, and the marimo GitHub repository has over 11,000 stars, with over 100 contributors.

Title: Elon Musk Is Joining Microsoft in $30 Billion Data Center Project
URL: https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-is-joining-microsoft-in-30-billion-data-center-project-2000578097

Elon Musk somehow manages to win again. Microsoft, along with BlackRock and UAE-based MGX, have announced they are partnering with his artificial intelligence startup xAI on a $30 billion project to develop data centers and other infrastructure. Microsoft, being the largest backer of OpenAI, is essentially teaming up with one of its rivals. That relationship has increasingly cooled as Microsoft loosens its reliance on the startup and develops its own in-house AI models including MAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is no fan of Musk, recently describing him as insecure in an interview, and must be screaming inside. Altman probably is not wrong about Musk’s insecurity, but insecurity is a powerful motivator. Gizmodo has reached out to xAI for comment. Musk’s companies do not often respond to media inquiries. The details of the new deal with xAI are unclear, like how much money Musk’s startup will commit to the data center venture. xAI has raised $12 billion since its founding in 2023, nearly the same amount as OpenAI, and is reportedly looking to raise another $10 billion. Its data center in Memphis, dubbed Colossus, is said to be the largest in the world with more than one million GPUs powering the Grok chatbot that is deeply integrated into X. xAI has received criticism for using gas turbines to feed its significant power demands, and receiving significant concessions from the city of Memphis even though data centers usually do not employ many people, and AI threatens to eliminate jobs. Most companies in the space hope to build out nuclear energy to power their demands, which could be a positive for the green energy transition, but building out nuclear takes many years. In the meantime, President Trump has advocated for building out coal power plants next to data centers. Every company in the artificial intelligence space is racing to build out computing infrastructure they believe will be necessary to stand out in an incredibly competitive field. Forming partnerships could help spread the costs of these expansive projects, and Bloomberg reports that other investors might join the Microsoft-xAI project: The Microsoft-backed group will be renamed the AI Infrastructure Partnership, or AIP, and focus on infrastructure investments â including energy projects â mostly in the US, with a portion of the funds to be deployed in partner countries, according to the companies. The plan foresees bringing on additional investors. Clients, including pensions and insurers, are eager for such long-term infrastructure projects, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the statement. OpenAI early this year announced its own $100 billion infrastructure project with Oracle and SoftBank, one of the earlier signs that it was distancing itself from Microsoft. The big tech company has been building out its own in-house models that could be faster and less expensive to run than ChatGPT, and Microsoft likely does not want to be reliant on an independent company for its AI models if the technology is going to be as revolutionary as many in the industry believe. It is better to control your own destiny than rely on a wild and frenetic company like OpenAI, which has seen a slew of scandals and ongoing drama, including the brief ouster of Altman. The whole thing must be very satisfying to Musk, who clearly launched xAI out of jealousy of OpenAI’s sudden and massive rise. He co-founded the startup, after all, but left following disputes surrounding its direction, only to see the company launch ChatGPT and kickstart a new AI generation. Now he is teaming up with OpenAI’s largest backer on his own rival startup. Musk also continues to try and sue OpenAI over its transition to a for-profit company, among other issues. It is viewed as a convenient way to try and slow OpenAI’s growth as he builds a competitor. Musk’s close relationship with the Trump administration has aided him significantly, even if it has hurt one leg of his empire, Tesla. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that X is now privately valued at $44 billion, the exact same price he paid for what was then called Twitter back in 2022. Once a bastion of coastal elites, X has become something more of a Republican media outlet and microphone to promote President Trump’s agenda. xAI similarly has had no problems raising funding from sovereign wealth funds and others who want to be close to power. OpenAI’s ChatGPT remains far and away the most popular AI chatbot in use today with a reported 400 million weekly users and name recognition that none of its competitors enjoy. xAI is banking on its access to real-time posts from X to differentiate Grok as a powerful chatbot, even though the social network is littered with misinformation. Grok is deeply integrated with X, with buttons allowing users to ask for more context about specific posts. But the general idea seems to be that cozying up to Trump and making X the town square of the Republican party will support xAI’s rise as a major AI player. The chatbot, like all the others, suffers from serious issues producing accurate responses. Last year, Musk gave shares in xAI to investors in his Twitter takeover, as well as preferential access to xAI’s funding rounds, effectively ensuring they would make their money back. The new deal with Microsoft cements xAI as a legitimate player in the AI race. While it remains a major question how impactful AI chatbots will really become in the world, it is understood that should they be as successful as hoped, having access to significant compute will help the few survive. Anyone can run a model like DeepSeek, but “agents” that control computers and do work for users will be resource-intensive, and users will go to competitors if their usage is rate-limited by another.

Title: Fed keeps interest rates unchanged in March

Share this article The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged today, maintaining the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.50% for the second consecutive meeting amid growing recession concerns fueled by the Trump administration’s economic policies. The central bank has adjusted its 2025 economic forecasts, lowering GDP growth projections to 1.7% from the previous 2.1% in December, while simultaneously raising forecasts for unemployment to 4.4% from 4.3%, PCE inflation to 2.7% from 2.5%, and core PCE inflation to 2.8% from 2.5%. The Fed projects two 50-basis-point interest rate cuts in 2025, consistent with both market expectations and its December forecast. The decision matched widespread market expectations. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicated a 99% probability of the Fed maintaining its current target interest rates, reflecting near-unanimous market confidence in that outcome. In its FOMC statement, the central bank highlighted a resilient labor market but voiced concerns about persistent inflation and global economic challenges. The Fed indicated it would carefully monitor inflation and labor market data before adjusting policy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell echoed this cautious approach last month, noting a strong economy that doesn’t yet warrant changes. With his press conference minutes away, markets await clarity on what conditions might prompt future rate moves—and how the Fed views mounting economic risks. This Wednesday’s meeting was the first since the enactment of Trump’s trade policies targeting China, Mexico, and Canada. The Fed had already flagged these tariffs as a source of uncertainty at its January meeting, where rates also held steady. Economists warn that Trump’s tariffs could reverse recent inflation progress by driving up consumer prices and inviting retaliation, potentially straining the economy. US inflation data supports a cooling trend—the consumer price index rose 0.2% in February, lowering the annual rate to 2.8% from 3%, with core CPI also up 0.2%—yet tariff fears persist. In an interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, Trump did not rule out the possibility of a recession. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added to recession concerns on March 10, stating he could not guarantee the US would dodge one. Powell’s upcoming remarks are poised to address these tensions—tariffs, inflation, and recession risks. Since the rate decision met expectations, his words will carry extra weight, potentially shaping market sentiment on whether Trump’s policies could tip the economy into downturn territory. As concerns over tariffs and recession mount, talk about Bitcoin heats up. BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robbie Mitchnick, sees a recession as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin, noting that increased liquidity and monetary stimulus could fuel its rise. “Bitcoin is long liquidity in the system. It’s catalyzed by more fiscal spending and debt and deficit accumulation. That happens in a recession,” he said during Yahoo Finance’s Market Domination Overtime on Tuesday. “It’s catalyzed by lower interest rates and monetary stimulus.” Comparing Bitcoin to gold, Mitchnick explained that while Bitcoin is fundamentally an uncorrelated asset, market sentiment sometimes creates short-term price correlations. He argued that Bitcoin should act as a global, decentralized, and non-sovereign asset akin to digital gold but acknowledged that short-term interest rate expectations and investor sentiment could influence its price. Despite recent market pullbacks, Bitcoin is still up approximately 15% since the beginning of November. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: FTC commissioners fired as federal agencies face reckoning

whyframeshot - stock.adobe.com Federal agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, Internal Revenue Service and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are all confronting significant changes as President Donald Trump advances campaign goals of reshaping the federal bureaucracy. Trump on March 18 fired Democratic FTC Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter. The FTC is composed of five presidentially nominated and Senate-confirmed commissioners to serve seven years. No more than three commissioners can be of the same political party, according to FTC rules. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson and FTC Commissioner Melissa Holyoak, both Republicans, remain on the commission. Mark Meador, a Republican whom Trump has nominated to the FTC, awaits congressional confirmation. After taking office in January, Trump took multiple steps to reduce federal agencies' authority. He issued an executive order freezing agencies from issuing new regulations, followed by another order stipulating that federal employees in policy-influencing positions hold power delegated by the president and "must be accountable to the president." The order contained language asserting that cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining executive leadership have been numerous in recent years. Trump also established the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. DOGE has been closely involved in efforts to assess federal agencies and make cuts, detailing its efforts to eliminate government spending on X, formerly Twitter. As the Trump administration moves ahead with broad agency changes, it creates uncertainty for the business community, said Bill Baer, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and former antitrust enforcer at both the FTC and Department of Justice (DOJ). "I suppose some in the business community will think it's an opportunity to do things they would not have tried to do before," Baer said. "We just don't know enough to know whether there's going to be dramatic change or very modest shifts in what the priorities are and what the challenges will look like." On X, Bedoya decried being "illegally fired." The former FTC commissioner said he fought for small-town grocers, pharmacists and worker benefits during his time at the FTC. He said he also pushed back against tech companies that "think they can track you and your kids every hour of every day so they can pocket their next billion." Firing the two FTC commissioners strays from the agency's 110-year tradition of being a bipartisan, independent federal agency that offers a complementary approach to the DOJ, said George Hay, an antitrust law professor at Cornell Law School. Congress envisioned the FTC operating independently of the executive branch, he said. "It's a very valuable counterpart to the DOJ," Hay said. "That's the more serious long-term effect." Indeed, Baer said bipartisan debate on antitrust enforcement, competition policies and consumer protection was a significant value-add in the FTC. He also said it doesn't necessarily indicate that the Trump administration will back off antitrust enforcement. Both Ferguson and Gail Slater, assistant attorney general in the DOJ's antitrust division, have stated that they will continue to be assertive in antitrust enforcement, Baer noted. The FTC has drawn backlash from the business community for its internal adjudicative process, which differs from the DOJ's public court proceedings. Rick Smith, CEO of public safety technology vendor Axon Enterprise, testified before a congressional committee earlier this year about harm allegedly caused to his business by an FTC investigation in 2018. Still, Hay said that when making such significant changes to the FTC, "this is not the way to do it." The White House is waging a broader campaign to seize control over the membership and actions of federal regulatory agencies, said William Kovacic, director of the Competition Law Center at the George Washington University and a former FTC chair. Kovacic said the Trump administration has prioritized asserting that there is "no such thing as independent for a regulatory agency." "This is not so much a fight about the FTC as it is about the broader framework of economic regulation at the federal level," he said. The FTC isn't the only federal agency facing changes and policy shifts under the Trump administration. The IRS is reportedly planning mass layoffs. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents employees in more than 37 federal agencies, said this would be "ill-advised" and a violation of federal law under contractual arrangements between NTEU and the IRS. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau this month dropped seven enforcement cases against several banks and payment services, including Zelle, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, brought under the previous Biden administration. When the CFPB filed the lawsuit against Zelle in December, the company claimed in its response that the CFPB's lawsuit was legally flawed and appeared to be politically motivated. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which coordinates national cybersecurity resilience, also sustained staffing cuts, but reversed course due to a recent court order. Though some judges have challenged Trump's changes to federal agencies and staffing, including CISA staffing, the administration's rapid and overwhelming pace of change makes it difficult for anyone opposing the changes, Kovacic said. "The idea is you bewilder your opponent by the speed of operations," he said. "When you increase pace and speed, and maneuver very quickly, your adversary has a hard time figuring out what's going on. By the time they react, you've moved another 10 steps."

Title: The NBA’s next big insider may be an outsider

Jake Fischer was at a friend’s birthday party when a push notification lit up his phone just after midnight on February 2. His first thought: “That can’t be real.” The incoming tweet from ESPN’s senior NBA insider Shams Charania revealed that the Dallas Mavericks had unexpectedly traded their young superstar Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Dončić trade shocked the basketball world. Why would the Mavericks give away their best player, an ascendant 25-year-old who led them to the NBA Finals last season? BREAKING: The Dallas Mavericks are trading Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, Max Christie and a 2029 first-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Three-team deal that includes Utah. — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 2, 2025 Within minutes, a front office employee involved in the trade texted Fischer about it. Then someone from the Mavericks sent a message confirming the deal was, in fact, real. (As word spread, videos surfaced online showing the stunned reactions of fellow NBA players in the middle of their own games.) Soon, people were reaching out to Fischer, who also reports on the inner workings of the NBA, to verify the news. [ Click here to see the future of news in your inbox daily ] It was an especially big moment for sports journalism, which now devotes as much attention to the high drama of player transactions as it does to the actual competition. Once the story broke, Fischer stayed up until 4 a.m. calling around to investigate what happened and gather intel about other possible deals that could occur before the NBA’s February 6 trade deadline. “The way I cover this stuff, I’m always looking for a throughline and a trend that is connecting everything,” he said. “The Luka trade was the easiest way in. You could call anyone in the league and talk about that.” He spoke to contacts across the country, got a few hours of sleep, then picked up his phone as soon as he woke up to do it all again. When he wasn’t talking, he was writing. In the three days leading up to the trade deadline, he published four bylines about the latest NBA news. The NBA insider is a relatively new role in sports media. In the heyday of print journalism, player transactions were often buried in small font without a byline on the last page of the sports section. Today, however, an insider’s job consists of communicating with sources — such as front office executives and agents — and trying to break news before anyone else. One of the biggest challenges is scrutinizing where the details come from. In the NBA, an exchange of favors, rumors, and leaks goes on between league sources and reporters behind the scenes. Agents want to know how the latest whispers might affect the players and coaches they represent. Front office employees want to probe what other teams are thinking, or maybe mislead the competition if it can give them an edge. It’s the insider’s responsibility to confirm what’s real and convey that to the public. The role gained prominence back around 2010 thanks to Adrian Wojnarowski, an NBA writer for Yahoo Sports, who developed a following by posting his intel as quickly as possible on Twitter from his phone, which cut down on the time needed to edit and publish a traditional news article. His scoops got so popular fans gave them a nickname: Woj bombs. And he became such a household name that people bid up to $5,000 during an auction to buy his old iPhones. “There was a perfect storm of interest in the NBA, and then I think 2010 changed interest in free agency,” Wojnarowski said on a podcast last year. “That became its own thing, the trades, the deals, the buildup to the deals.” RELATED ARTICLECan reporters make bets on sports they cover? We asked a dozen newsrooms.Sarah ScireNovember 2, 2023Over time, breaking news also became big business. As a result, insiders turned into valuable media stars. With sports gambling now legal in 38 states, the public craves immediate updates since any news about a player could shift betting odds. In 2015, Wojnarowski emerged as a coveted free agent in his own right, and eventually left Yahoo for ESPN in 2017 after a bidding war. By the time he retired from sports journalism in 2024, he was in the middle of a three-year, $20 million contract from ESPN, meaning he made more money than many of the players he covered. ESPN hired Shams Charania to fill Wojnarowski’s insider role, reportedly for $3 million per year. While insiders typically work for established media companies like ESPN, where they benefit from substantial resources and access to big audiences, Jake Fischer’s position stands out. He operates out of his Brooklyn apartment and publishes scoops behind a paywall on Substack. It’s not even his own Substack. He contributes to The Stein Line, which was launched in 2021 by veteran reporter Marc Stein, who has covered the NBA for over 30 years at outlets including ESPN and The New York Times. The Stein Line currently ranks as the fifth most-popular sports newsletter on Substack, with over 40,000 subscribers. (Stein wouldn’t disclose how many are paid subscribers, but Substack’s leaderboard reveals it’s in the thousands.) Unlike Wojnarowski, who worked as a beat reporter at local newspapers before becoming an award-winning columnist, and Charania, who started trying to be an insider while still in high school, Fischer began his career hoping to write longform magazine features. “I never wanted to be an insider,” he said. Fischer scored an internship at Sports Illustrated in 2015 and stacked his portfolio with human interest articles. He got coffee with an NBA coach obsessed with Starbucks. He chronicled the rigorous routines that two over-40 players went through to stay on the court near the end of their careers. “I made all these relationships around the NBA by writing these non-threatening stories,” he said. During that stretch at Sports Illustrated, Fischer also became friends with Stein. “He kept reporting stuff that made me say, ‘Damn…I wish I had that.’ It was impossible not to take notice of his work,” Stein told me over email. “Gradually, I became a sounding board for him, to the extent that was possible when we were in direct competition.” In 2019, Fischer was part of mass layoffs at Sports Illustrated. He spent a chunk of time putting together a book, Built to Lose: How the NBA’s Tanking Era Changed the League Forever, which doubled as an audition to become an insider because it required interviewing hundreds of executives, players, scouts, and coaches. Next came a stop at Bleacher Report, which Fischer parlayed into the senior NBA reporter role at Yahoo Sports, the same place Wojnarowski built his reputation. However, in 2024, new management took over the site and declined to pick up Fischer’s contract. Soon after, Stein reached out to see if they could work together. “I was very intrigued by it because of the entrepreneurial aspect of being your own boss,” Fischer said. Insider reporting can be a ruthless, zero-sum game. There are only so many scoops to go around, and journalists can be extremely protective of their sources. That makes Stein and Fischer an interesting team. Fischer refers to Stein as his “work dad” and keeps his contact info pinned to the top of the Messages app on his computer. They share intel and co-byline stories. As Stein says, “We have access to more sources who can help with confirmations if we join forces on a given story.” Most articles containing in-depth reporting sit behind the paywall, but they periodically publish free stories on Substack in addition to revealing scoops on social media. They also have more room to experiment on Substack; for example, they host exclusive chats on the platform, where they take questions from paid subscribers about the latest NBA rumors and theories. In a rare mid-season move, Rip City Remix guard Isaac Nogués Gonzaléz is submitting paperwork to enter the 2025 NBA Draft. “I can defend a lot of positions. Not only the point guard. Not only the best player,” he told me. More here @TheSteinLine: https://t.co/EoT0fxXrq9 pic.twitter.com/rwvqq5xqNp — Jake Fischer (@JakeLFischer) March 3, 2025 Their approach stands out in other ways as well. “We always say we try to be as gentlemanly as possible,” Fischer explained. For example, he tries not to call anyone before 10 a.m. When thinking through the language of scoops, he cares about avoiding certain phrases like “shopping a player,” which can have a negative, almost dehumanizing connotation. Even Fischer’s appearance differs from the typical corporate polish of NBA insiders. He’s scruffy and has long hair that’s smoothed back close to his shoulders. “When a college kid asks me, ‘How do you develop sources?’ I tell them right away, ‘Stop trying to develop sources,’” Fischer said. “Just meet people and treat them as a person.” The attitude sounds both strange and refreshing, but in some ways, it may prevent Fischer from doing whatever is necessary to get a scoop. In the world of insiders, there’s a fine line between source and friend. Wojnarowski, for example, faced criticism for publishing favorable stories about certain sources. However, access isn’t guaranteed, and if a source gets burned with incorrect information, they may never pick up the phone again. “There are so many more walls to smash through today to find that same level of proximity to players, coaches, [and] front offices compared to what I faced for the first two-thirds of my career,” Stein said. [ Click here to see the future of news in your inbox daily ] A few years ago, an agent vowed that his entire agency would never talk to Fischer again after the young reporter relayed bad information. This year, though, that agent called Fischer more than anyone else in the week leading up to the deadline, asking what he’d heard about one client, who ended up getting traded. “I feel like if you treat people well, they always come back,” Fischer said. That mentality may be why he’s managed to carve out a unique role for himself in a constantly evolving sports media landscape. In addition to writing for The Stein Line, Fischer also produces freelance NBA video content for Bleacher Report. Speaking of video, last summer, the NBA agreed to an 11-year, $76 billion new media rights deal that will change how fans can watch games. As part of the deal, streaming services like Amazon and NBC’s Peacock will broadcast some games starting next season. New NBA media partners could also mean new professional opportunities for an insider like Fischer. Fischer told me he had “very cursory conversations” with some of the new media partners back in the fall as they began building out their broadcast teams. Now that the trade deadline is over, those conversations should pick back up. While Fischer could see himself collaborating with Stein for the rest of his career, he’d also welcome the chance to supplement his Substack writing with more on-camera work. “But I would try to do it in my own way,” he said with a grin. “And I’m not cutting my hair.” Jordan Teicher is a freelance writer based in New Jersey.

Title: Chipmaker Taco Bell taps chipmaker Nvidia

Two chipmaking giants are joining forces. Yum! Brands (YUM-0.54%) has tapped Nvidia (NVDA-1.05%) to accelerate the use of AI across its global restaurant network. Joe Park, Yum chief digital and technology officer, said the goal of the partnership is to create easier experiences for customers and employees, and provide franchises with “better, faster, cheaper, and safer technology,” while maximizing shareholder returns. The collaboration will focus on three key areas for Yum: voice AI ordering for drive-thrus and call centers, computer vision to optimize operational efficiency, and restaurant intelligence, using AI-generated analytics to boost performance. Pilot programs for these technologies are already underway in select Taco Bell and Pizza Hut locations across the U.S., with plans for a broader rollout targeting 500 restaurants across all Yum brands in the second quarter. Yum also owns KFC and Habit Burger & Grill. Taco Bell has been exploring AI for several years. In July 2024, chief innovation officer Lawrence Kim said Yum had been testing AI voice technology for two years. By then, over 100 Taco Bell drive-thrus in 13 states had already implemented the technology. As the AI race intensifies among tech giants, restaurants are increasingly adopting the technology to stay competitive. AI has already become a mainstay in Big Food, with chains like McDonalds (MCD-0.86%), Chick-fil-A, and Wendy’s (WEN-0.45%) using it to streamline operations, reduce labor costs, and boost efficiency. Chick-fil-A is using robots to cut and squeeze lemons, while Wendy’s is using AI to help it manage Frosty demand. This partnership marks Nvidia’s first venture into the restaurant sector. It also signals a strategic shift for Yum, which has historically built its tech operations through acquisitions. By partnering with Nvidia, Yum will own the AI intelligence created, allowing it to customize the technology to its needs. Although the financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, both Yum and Nvidia have seen stock growth, with Yum up 14% over the past year and Nvidia’s stock rising 35%.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Merck & Co. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/MRK or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Nvidia delivered again at the GTC, but it wasn't enough for everyone
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-gtc-blackwell-ultra-rubin-ai-chips-investors-1851770931
Time Published: 2025-03-19T15:19:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA-1.05%) unveiled more about its next artificial intelligence chips, humanoid robots, and AI supercomputers at its GPU Technology Conference on Tuesday — but some investors wanted more. The chipmaker’s stock fell by more than 3% after the annual developer conference, also known as the GTC. The stock reversed course during pre-market trading on Wednesday, and was up by 2.2% at the open. Later in the morning, Nvidia’s shares were up by 1.2%. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company’s Blackwell chips — which were announced at the last GTC — are now in full production after hitting snags last year. The next Blackwell Ultra NVL72 chips, which will have one-and-a-half times more memory and two times more bandwidth, will be used to accelerate building AI agents, physical AI, and reasoning models, Huang said during his keynote address. Blackwell Ultra will be available in the second half of this year. The chipmaker’s next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs will be released in the second half of next year, Huang said, followed by Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027. Rubin Ultra will be four GPUs connected together on a single chip. The next AI chip architecture will be named Feynman, Huang said, and is slated for 2028. “The rate of innovation on all fronts continues to impress and suggests a growing moat versus peers,” Jefferies (JEF+0.64%) analysts said in a note on Wednesday. “However, the updated roadmap does suggest Rubin will only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, shared similar sentiments in a Wednesday note saying that the Rubin launch “promises another big jump over Blackwell, but smaller than the jump Blackwell made over Hopper.” However, Windsor said the chipmaker “is showing no sign of slowing down meaning that it is quickly expanding into any area where AI will be relevant with the strategy to become the industry standard” before its competitors can start to catch up. While this will help Nvidia keep its market dominance, having more than 85% of market share for data center chips will keep it “a hostage to end demand,” leading to some “tough quarters when the inevitable correction comes,” Windsor said. He added that there are no signs of this yet, as AI-focused companies plan to continue spending tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year. Bank of America (BAC+0.06%) analysts maintained their “buy” rating for Nvidia, and said they are looking forward to Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra, which show “unmatched roadmap as Rubin advances AI performance 900x (scale-up FLOPs) over Hopper (Blackwell is 68x) in TCO optimized way,” in a note on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives said in a post-conference note on Tuesday that demand for Nvidia’s GPUs “remains extremely robust” and “is currently outstripping supply 15:1” as enterprises wait to receive their AI chips. “In essence, Nvidia’s chips remain the new oil or gold in this world for the tech ecosystem as there is only one chip in the world fueling this AI foundation ... and it’s Nvidia,” Wedbush said.

Title: Boeing stock soars as executive plays up progress — and downplays Trump tariffs

Boeing’s (BA+4.23%) stock jumped more than 6% after CFO Brian West gave upbeat remarks at the Bank of America (BAC+0.06%) Global Industrials Conference, saying the planemaker is on track with its key success factors for the year, according to a Bloomberg News report. West highlighted progress on manufacturing, citing “fantastic” performance in its push to complete 38 aircraft per month and the stabilization of 787 output at five per month. He didn’t anticipate a material near-term impact from tariffs, but admitted to concerns about parts availability. Wednesday’s increase means the company’s shares are trading roughly unchanged so far this year despite unresolved concerns about the effects of President Donald Trump’s imposed and planned tariffs. The company has many suppliers outside the U.S. and must keep prices contained to be able to effectively compete against Airbus (AIR-0.13%) in the commercial plane market. CEO Kelly Ortberg told staff earlier this month that Trump’s tariffs would boost costs on parts like landing gear that are imported from Canada, Bloomberg News reported. Boeing has a Winnipeg-based division that makes more than 500 parts and assemblies for its commercial unit, and is a “tier 1" partner on the 787 Dreamliner, which is assembled in South Carolina. Boeing is also one of the top 10 manufacturers in Mexico and spends up to $1 billion in the nation through its supply chain, according to a company fact sheet. It spends more than $500 million in Mexico each year on commercial airplane parts. Tariffs could create a “continuity of supply issue,” Ortberg said. Boeing’s aircraft are made up of thousands of parts subject to demanding specifications, so suppliers aren’t easily replaced. Aerospace expert Jerrold Lundquist recently noted that a Boeing 737 has about 2,000 parts sourced from 700 suppliers. The CEO of the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, AerCap (AER-1.97%), said earlier that under the worst-case trade war scenario, the price of a 787 could increase by $40 million. “No one’s going to want to pay that,” Angus Kelley told told CNBC’s Squawk Box on March 12. —William Gavin contributed to this article.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Griffin Gaming Partners’ Peter Levin Talks AI, Market Trends, Emerging Markets & Hollywood Interest Amid GDC

Venture-capital firm manages $1.5 billion in assets focusing on the video games space By Kaare Eriksen Media Analyst The push to utilize generative AI across entertainment isn’t sparing the ever-complex video games industry by any means. With the Game Developers Conference underway this week, Griffin Gaming Partners managing director and co-founder Peter Levin joined Variety Intelligence Platform president Andrew Wallenstein and media analyst Kaare Eriksen on Variety’s “Strictly Business” podcast and wasted no breath expressing the urgency with which AI tech is top of mind for the business and development sides of gaming alike. “I think we’re gonna continue to see a bunch of conversations around AI, its impact on games development, its impact on the picks-and-shovels businesses in and around games development,” said Levin. Related Stories VIP+ ‘Born Again’ on Disney+, ‘Daredevil’ Viewership Beats the Odds So Far Oscars Team Reveals All: Karla and Drake Jokes, Adrien Brody's Cutoff, Last-Minute Gene Hackman Scramble and If Conan Will Return Extensive layoffs throughout the global gaming industry are ongoing for more than a year now as major publishers and gaming divisions within larger entertainment companies have gotten aggressive with cost-cutting measures. Concern over AI is mounting among game developers hoping for job prospects to lighten and for stability to come, but Levin sees the embrace of AI as integral to gaming’s future. Popular on Variety Listen to the full podcast: “It’s an optimal time to be a developer or publisher and bake in the AI functionality within your product roadmap,” said Levin. “If they’re not crazy about it, that’s going to happen with or without their sentiment.” “I say this gently and lightly and [am] certainly not celebrating the eradication of anyone’s jobs,” Levin added. “But gaming, traditionally, has been much more akin to enterprise software with respect to recognizing when they need to trim the fat.” AI tech has long been part of the development process and gaming experience across traditional titles, whether for programming enemy NPCs or aiding in procedural generation of player environments, but newer interest in AI in the gaming space has lately revolved around generating content entirely from scratch, utilizing existing assets for UGC purposes and plotting more efficient release strategies. “Some of the ways we’re very excited about the practical application of AI are manifesting in things like customer acquisition, the ability to lever which social media platforms, for example, are the best environments within which to market to a certain customer,” said Levin. Despite the industry’s headwinds, the oncoming launches of Nintendo Switch 2 and “Grand Theft Auto 6” in 2025 have Levin excited, as do emerging markets for games outside of North America and Europe, where smartphone proliferation continues to power the mobile games sector. “You’ve got the telco players, whether that’s the Mittals [Bharti Airtel] or the MTNs or the Vodafones,” said Levin. “They’re looking at what some of the other carriers have done in markets like North America, where they’ve left a lot of money on the table… These carriers really don’t participate in these markets, in the economics, you’ve got Google gobbling up and you’ve got, obviously, Apple and iOS gobbling up their share.” “At some point, these [U.S.] carriers become self-commoditizing big fat pipes, and that’s a mistake that I think in a lot of emerging markets they would like to fix,” Levin said. “So they’re going to invest directly into content. They want more skin in the game. They want a more intimate relationship with that consuming demographic.” Levin continued: “You see a lot of expats in emerging markets, and I think that’s one way to address the opportunity. But at some point you have to have local talent. It’s less expensive. They understand not just the localization of content, but the culturalization of content, which is a much harder needle to thread.” As for Hollywood’s involvement in gaming, Levin praised Remedy Entertainment’s deal with Annapurna Pictures to fund development for “Control 2” in exchange for exclusive film and TV rights to “Control” and “Alan Wake” as a “great example of thinking outside of the box.” Levin is also excited for the prospects of games at Skydance, should its deal to acquire Paramount Global go through. “Hopefully when David Ellison and [Skydance] close on Paramount… I think they’re gonna have a much different orientation towards gaming,” said Levin. “They’re gonna have a longer runway to play with.” “Strictly Business” is Variety’s weekly podcast featuring conversations with industry leaders about the business of media and entertainment.

Title: Pressure is ramping up in Big Tech. Employees told BI how they feel about it.

Good morning. New documents filed by the Justice Department shed light on how far the White House has gone in trying to cut probationary staff from the federal government. It's the largest insight yet into the mass firings. Oh, and if you're missing your usual anchor Dan DeFrancesco, he's got a funny story for you from parental leave. In today's big story, tech companies are sending a message to employees: The days of perks and pampering are over. What's on deck First, the tables have turned. Do more with less. That's the new mantra in Silicon Valley. Gone are the days of the in-office massage, the free laundry services, and the fancy food. Layoffs and budget cuts have become pervasive in response to a trifecta of issues: economics, post-pandemic realities, and political pressure. But CEOs aren't just ending the office pampering — they want everyone to know it. Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, the message is clear: Tech is going hardcore. Here are just several examples of how tech companies have changed their tune: Big Tech leaders haven't been shy about adopting hard-driving strategies. But what do their employees think? BI reporters interviewed staff at tech giants including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta — as well as various startups — about the changes. "There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days," a current Google manager told BI. A recruiting firm cofounder said he's heard multiple leaders tell their employees the same thing: "If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down." Tech employees had it sweet. Now, they have to sweat. 1. Tesla's stock slide just sped up. Shares are on pace to fall for a 9th straight week, and the slide accelerated on Tuesday thanks to a hailstorm of issues involving its CEO, competition, and expectations on Wall Street. However, Tesla's employees — many of whom receive large stock grants as part of their compensation packages — aren't worried. 2. Stagflation is the market's big bogeyman. Investors dumped a record amount of US stock last week. Growing stagflation fears were key, a Bank of America survey found, with 71% of fund managers saying they expected it to hit the global economy in the next 12 months. 3. Predicting where stocks could go next. It's a bad idea to use news headlines when trying to guess where the markets will go. Technical analyst Helene Meisler told BI the five charts she's using instead to gauge market sentiment, and what she sees in its future. 1. A big acquisition with bigger implications. Google's parent company Alphabet has acquired the cybersecurity firm Wiz for a whopping $32 billion. The deal rewards early Wiz investors, but other startups could stand to benefit if it catalyzes an M&A cycle. It'll also test the regulatory environment under Trump. 2. Elon Musk has gone MIA as CEO. He's not the only one. Musk's reign at DOGE has Tesla investors wanting their CEO back — but he's not the first chief executive to go AWOL. Company morale and productivity are paying the price. 3. Everything Jensen Huang revealed at the Nvidia conference. The CEO shared the company's road map for the next few years, including updates on the next generation of chips. He also introduced Blue, a "Star Wars"-like robot, to show off a partnership with Google and Disney. 1. One year after the real-estate revolution. A landmark settlement upended traditional industry practice by changing the way real estate agents are paid. Now, some Americans are saving big on homebuying. 2. The vibecession is back. The US isn't in a recession, but Americans feel like they're in one. That's thanks to recent market volatility, Trump's shifting tariff policies, and more. Even if the economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession still has serious consequences. 3. Inside JPMorgan's RTO plans for its largest office. Employees at JPMorgan's Polaris campus are heading back to the office next month. The bank is promising amenities like upgraded dining and shuttle services, according to a memo exclusively seen by BI, but not everyone is thrilled. Jensen Huang delivers keynote speech at Nvidia GTC AI conference. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

The mission, titled "Finding Hot Wildfires Near You," is slated for liftoff during a window beginning March 27th UTC from Rocket Lab's Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand. Remarkably, this launch was arranged just four months following the signing of the contract, underscoring Rocket Lab's capability to meet tight deadlines for time-sensitive satellite missions. Electron will carry eight satellites from OroraTech's Constellation Phase 1 to a 550km orbit.

Stocks advanced on Wednesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate announcement at 2 p.m., which will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all rose modestly as of 10:52 a.m. — with the all the Magnificent 7 shares except Meta (META+1.40%) rising. The Fed will probably keep interest rates on hold, with investors focused on board members’ rate expectations — the so-called dot plot — and on the central bank’s revised economic forecasts, observers said. Powell’s comments will also be scrutinized. While the Fed governors are expected to keep the key rate at 4.5%, they may opt to pause — or signal a possible pause in May of — quantitative tightening (QT), the sale of financial assets from its balance sheet, economists said. The U.S. economy is definitely softening, but economists are divided as to the direction of inflation and policy, with some projecting three rate cuts starting as soon as the current meeting — which would be a surprise — and others seeing policymakers staying put for longer as prices remain sticky. Here are some stocks to watch today: Autodesk (ADSK-0.21%) stock gained 3.9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Starboard Value plans to start a proxy fight at the design-software company. Boeing’s (BA+4.23%) stock jumped more than 6% after CFO Brian West gave upbeat remarks at the Bank of America Global Industrials Conference, saying the planemaker is on track with its key success factors for the year, according to a Bloomberg News report. General Mills (GIS+1.06%) stock fell 1.6% after the food company’s quarterly revenue fell short of expectations and it cut its sales forecast for the year. Gilead (GILD-0.26%) stock fell 3.8% after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering cutting spending on domestic HIV prevention. GSK’s (GSK-0.08%) U.S.-listed shares fell about 2%. Nvidia (NVDA-1.05%) stock gained 1%. The chipmaker’s AI conference in San Jose continues Wednesday. The keynote address Tuesday by CEO Jensen Huang failed to wow investors amid a tech-stock selldown, despite his announcement that the company will team up with GM (GM+0.33%) to build self-driving cars. Here’s a roundup from the speech. Tencent’s (TCEHY-0.51%) quarterly sales and profit both beat expectations and the Chinese internet giant announced increased investment in AI. The ADRs gained about 0.7%. Tesla (TSLA+4.10%) stock jumped 2.7% after it obtained a permit in California to operate a ride service and Cantor Fitzgerald — the firm formerly run by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — upgraded the shares to a buy. Elon Musk’s EV maker fell 5.3% on Tuesday after BYD (BYDDY-5.99%) unveiled an ultra-fast charger, amid growing signs that Chinese EV makers are motoring ahead. BYD’s ADRs advanced 1.8%, following the Hong Kong-listed shares higher. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Tech employees are getting the message: Play time's over

For years, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke enjoyed a reputation for growing the $125 billion e-commerce company without working the grueling hours expected of startup founders. "My job is incredible, but it's also just a job. Family and personal health rank higher in my priority list," he wrote in a now-deleted post on X, then Twitter, shortly before the pandemic, as reported by Business Insider at the time. "The only times I worked more than 40 hours in a week was when I had the burning desire to do so." This year, even Lütke appeared to change his tune. "I'm at home for dinner but I work at least 10 or so hours a day and a lot of the weekend," Lütke wrote on X. He was responding to a user who called him a "counter-example" to a meme suggesting you can't have work-life balance and a breakthrough startup. "I don't want people to get misguided by this meme." Across tech, the tables have turned for employees as performance pressure and proclamations of "efficiency" and "intensity" replace perks and pampering. Sweeping layoffs have become the norm in an industry that, in recent memory, enjoyed job security. The pressure to dominate in AI has created intense competition, as companies use the technology to do more with fewer workers. Already hard-driving workplaces have become even harder. While the situation for tech employees has been changing since the pandemic boom ended in 2022, more recent developments include a decidedly different tone from executives. Now, companies aren't just making these changes; they want to be seen making them. Elon Musk's slash-and-burn tactics are now being embraced by Silicon Valley in the name of efficiency. At Twitter, Musk cut 80% of the staff — over 6,000 people. Years later, the company didn't collapse as some feared. And now, Musk's outsized influence on President Donald Trump and his administration has empowered both him and his cut throat strategies. CEOs of the biggest tech giants are following suit with similar tactics. Meta earlier this year said it was cutting 4,000 employees deemed low performers as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the "culturally neutered" corporate world had gotten away from "masculine energy." Amazon insisted that employees return to the workplace every weekday, a policy some employees say is stricter than before the pandemic. Other companies have cracked down, too. Microsoft, which was once referred to as a "country club" for its relatively lax culture, cut 2,000 employees as it overhauled its review process to eliminate underperformers more quickly. Google, which practically invented tech perks like free lunch, started an "efficiency drive." Its cofounder Sergey Brin, who had stepped away from leading Google but now often shows up to work on the company's Gemini AI models, recently recommended that employees working on its Gemini tools should work 60 hours a week and go into the office "at least every weekday." Wall Street has rewarded this rigor, as stock prices of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's parent, Alphabet, have surged since 2022. Startups also see a trickle-down effect from Big Tech companies' pressures. Krish Ramadurai, a partner at AIX Ventures, said he had noticed a "pronounced shift" toward leaner teams and rigorous performance standards at startups. Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, it's clear not only that the tech industry is done coddling employees, but that companies want to send the message those days are over. BI interviewed employees from tech giants, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta, as well as various tech startups, about the changes. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity since they're not authorized to talk to the press, though their identities are known to BI. Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon did not comment. Shopify did not respond to a request for comment. For years, fierce competition for tech workers meant companies spoiled employees with astonishing salaries and swanky perks, such as in-office massages and free food cooked by fancy chefs. By 2022, tech companies seemingly couldn't throw enough money at workers. Early that year, Amazon more than doubled its maximum base salary, and Microsoft gave across-the-board raises to employees up to a certain level of seniority to dissuade them from leaving for competitors. As the pandemic boom ended, tech stocks plummeted, and interest rates increased through 2022. This prompted an efficiency drive by many companies as investors demanded profitability over growth at all costs. Also that year, companies watched the billionaire Elon Musk's handling of the Twitter acquisition, in which he cut thousands of employees, plus perks like free lunches, and demanded a commitment to a new "extremely hardcore" vision and "long hours at a high intensity." At one point, Twitter workers were begging on Slack for toilet paper and clean bathrooms amid Musk's drastic cost-cutting. As of late last year, Fidelity valued X at only about 20% of the $44 billion that Musk bought it for in 2022. Still, his approach may have expanded what the tech industry thought possible in terms of workforce and cost cutting. "People paid attention because the prevailing wisdom was you couldn't take out that much of an engineering organization and put that much instability on it and not have it fall over," Brad Porter, the founder and CEO of Cobot, told BI. "It did come close to falling. He pushed right to the edge of it actually falling over, but it didn't fall over." By the end of 2022 and in early 2023, tech giants had conducted unprecedented rounds of layoffs. Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft collectively laid off more than 60,000 employees during that time. Layoffs have remained at a steady drip across the industry since. Such cuts have become so frequent at Google, for example, that employees have taken to crowdsourcing information on layoffs in an internal Google Doc. Employees told BI about the pressure across the industry to "do more with less." "There's lots of uncertainty," one longtime Amazon employee said, "and lots of pressure to perform the jobs of multiple people at the mercy of ruthless middle management." Tech companies are also culling middle management layers. Amazon in September announced a plan to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of this month. In December, CEO Sundar Pichai told his staff that Google had cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of its efficiency drive. Microsoft also monitors what it calls "span of control," tracking the number of reports per manager. Amid the cuts, employees across the industry say companies are dialing up the performance demands. Meta told its staff in January that it would eliminate roughly 5% of its workforce, or about 4,000 employees, to "raise the bar on performance management," as Zuckerberg wrote in an internal memo. Google also increased pressure on employees. Perhaps most telling was Pichai's December comments attempting to clarify what "Googleyness" means for a modern Google. Once a squishy and vague philosophy for the search giant's corporate culture, Pichai said he believed it now meant, among other things, being "mission first." "There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days," a longtime Google manager said. "We're being asked to do more for less," said another current longtime Google employee. That same Google employee said that Silicon Valley had been moving toward more ruthless, efficient workplaces for a while — and that the current political climate "gives them the green light to do it openly." Google has been working to become more efficient since its chief investment officer Ruth Porat joined the company as CFO from Morgan Stanley in 2015, "but now the masks are off," the person said. Microsoft was once referred to as the tech industry's "country club," meaning a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. A change this year shows how far Microsoft has shifted when it fired 2,000 employees deemed low performers without severance and ended their health benefits the same day. This kind of performance-based mass cut showed a shift for the tech giant. One longtime Microsoft senior-level employee said they felt that the "culture shifts toward firmer performance expectations" at peer tech companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon made it more acceptable for Microsoft to do the same. At TikTok, the pressure to perform jumped last year after the company directed managers to deliver more low scores in performance reviews, leading to PIPs and eventual exits. At the same time, six current and former employees told BI their goals had become much harder to hit. One staffer called the goals "unattainable." The company has also recently heightened RTO requirements for some teams. In February, it told its US e-commerce workers that in addition to being in the office five days a week, they would physically need to be in the building for eight hours a day. Ten current and former workers told BI that burnout had become common, leading to some going on mental health leave to get a break. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. "You feel like if you're not hitting a target, even if it's a moving target, you're in trouble," a former staffer who went on leave for mental health reasons told BI. "For me, it was just feeling like a failure, like I couldn't do anything right." The increasing pivot to performance has even made it to already hard-charging startups. Startups have a time-honored tradition of an always-on, work-first lifestyle. Early employees are expected to put in grueling hours of coding and customer support during this critical phase, known as the "valley of death," when startups are flush with initial funding but not yet profitable. The free-money era tested this tradition of hustle and thriftiness. Investors heaped money into small startups when interest rates bottomed out, and the blitz scaling that followed set off an arms race of perks to help startups attract top talent. Employees could work from home and set their own schedules. They pocketed wellness stipends and trotted the globe on extravagant off-sites. The tech startup Bolt gave many employees Fridays off. "I think many individuals — founders included — lost sight of the true goal of a company. It is to make money," Mang-Git Ng, the founder of Anvil, a paperwork automation company, told BI. Now, the executives who had lavished high salaries and fancy perks on their employees are resetting expectations, winding down remote work, and cutting head count. "Everyone who comes into our office at Decagon has opted into working with a team that's here because we want to do big things and see bigger and better results," said Jesse Zhang, the founder of Decagon, who now badges into the office six days a week. "There's no such thing as a rocketship that doesn't have a certain level of intensity to fuel its trajectory." Call it the Big Tech trickle-down effect. "Founders aren't sugarcoating it," said Natan Fisher, who runs a recruiting firm, SingleSprout, that specializes in hiring technical talent. "I've had a few cofounders tell employees they aren't working hard enough, and, 'If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down.' Late nights, weekends, even people crashing at the office, it's real." Have a tip? Contact Ashley Stewart via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

Title: Sorting out the confusion on quantum computing utility

Understanding quantum computing’s pace of progress is not an easy task. Recent months have complicated it with contradictory messages. CEOs like Jensen Huang (Nvidia) and Mark Zuckerberg (Meta) estimated that useful quantum computers were decades away, while others like Satya Nadella (Microsoft) and Sundar Pichai (Google) cast it as being just years from now. Some companies even stated that quantum computers would soon run LLMs more efficiently, with a lower energy footprint than classical HPCs running Nvidia GPUs. Your newsfeed is now full of imperatives: “the advent of useful quantum computers is not a matter of if, but when“, “this is the year to get ready” (whatever the year), “if you don’t jump in now, you’re late” (striking fear), such and such technology announcement “is a breakthrough” (Google Willow in December 2024, Microsoft Majorana-1 in February 2025), “we are getting closer to scalable quantum computers” (hopefully, not farther), “quantum computing progress is accelerating” (how do measure progress speed?), Google Willow or China’s Zuchongzhi quantum computers are already computing zillion “times faster than the largest classical supercomputer“, and so on! The stock market’s ups and downs shake the market cap of Rigetti, D-Wave and IonQ. Here, trust is not based on science but on buzz and beliefs, often only grounded on company’s investor decks and quarterly results. This is the characteristic of a “technology hype”, with its overpromises. These are fueled by research and industry vendor funding mechanisms, technology sovereignty issues, analysts and service companies’ opportunism and media buzz, which I described in an arXiv paper in 2022. End-user organizations and policymakers are also confused. You need a cold head to analyze this frenzy. You’re better off being embedded in the quantum ecosystem to know its stakes, but also, not being too much conflicted from the financial standpoint. Evaluating the quantum computing state of the art requires a broad scientific and technological background. If you are a quantum physicist, you may be too specialized, not knowing much about quantum algorithms. On the other hand, if you are a quantum software developer with not much knowledge of the hardware, you may not grasp the physics challenges to build a large scale quantum computer. And you are better off with having some knowledge of the state of the art in classical computing (GPUs, tensor networks, machine learning, etc.) against which quantum solutions are compared. So, here I am, with a couple of others, trying to bridge these gaps and to provide some understanding of the situation. To ease its reading, this paper is structured as a FAQ, addressing the following questions: It’s a bit like if you had 16 short papers for the price of one, given it’s free. If you cry very loudly, I can turn this into a series of 16 TikTok videos. Or maybe not… Still, you have a one liner blue response to all these questions. And then, elaborations! How to define utility-grade quantum computing? Who you are: a quantum physicist doing a Fermi-Hubbard simulation of some ferromagnetic material (example), a pharmaceutical company willing to simulate large molecular dynamics to design some new drug, a chemical company designing a new battery, a financial institution in search of better portfolio optimization techniques or a transportation company willing to optimize its operations? What benefit are you looking for: a quantum speedup, providing improved results like better chemical accuracy for some chemical simulation, a better solution with heuristics used to find approximate solutions of optimization problems, do something that is entirely impossible with classical computers, do stuff cheaper, with cheaper hardware or less energy? The definition of a “quantum computing advantage” is nowadays becoming multifactorial. Compared to what? The notion of usefulness is also not absolute but relative to classical computing. It can be against your own IT legacy or with best-in-class up-to-date classical solutions. Nvidia GPUs, deep learning techniques and classical tensor networks (MPS, DMRG) are continuously moving the goalpost for quantum computing to yield some quantum advantage. One interesting example is AlphaFold 3 from Google DeepMind, which does stuff initially thought only possible with future quantum computers in the 3D modeling predictions of complex organic molecules. At what cost? The value of anything new comes from computing its return on investment in comparison with competing solutions. With current quantum computers, this is a rarely debated aspect. Nobody really elaborates on the current and future prices of quantum computers. In the FTQC regime, it will become an important one, which will depend on the affordability of these systems. Hint: utility grade quantum computers supporting the thousand logical qubits and teraquops needed to run industry-grade applications may cost between $10M (which is acceptable) to several $1Bs (which is not), depending on the technology. This is like in quantum physics, it’s all about the measurement context! Variation of a slide from my QEI Workshop presentation showing how practical benefits are connected to the solution’s economics and business benefits (video, slides). One effect described in the above chart is the virtuous cycle that can come from platform and network effects coupled with the versatility of quantum computing systems. These could enlarge the quantum computing market and contribute to developing economies of scale, in turn driving prices down and extending its reach. This is the ultimate definition of “utility grade”. What quantum utility has been achieved so far? Consider IBM’s communication on “quantum utility” which started in June 2023 with the publication of a Nature paper and subsequent scientific papers related to the use of their most recent quantum computer (Eagle with 127 qubits, and, later, Heron with 133 or 156 qubits), or more recently, D-Wave with its 4,400 qubit Advantage 2 quantum annealer. These “utility cases” were about simulating some kicked Ising model for IBM, and the quench dynamics of two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses for D-Wave. This is about simulating the magnetism of materials at around 0K, a temperature found only in physics labs, at a scale supposedly unreachable by classical computers! These are interesting physics problems but far from any industry relevant problem. On top of that, both in both the IBM and D-Wave cases, subsequent papers argued that the quantum solution could be implemented classically, using tensor network methods, noticeably from the Flatiron Institute in New York (vs IBM and vs D-Wave). This spurs endless debates between the vendors and these classical computing specialists (example from D-Wave’s CEO). Right now, we have in-store quantum computers operating in gate-based mode like IBM’s, or using some analog processes like D-Wave quantum annealers or Pasqal/QuEra cold-atom-based quantum analog simulators. Quantum computing utility faces different challenges in all these cases due to algorithms resource requirements, theorical vs practical speedups, and (un)availability of fault-tolerant quantum computers of sufficient size. I ordered these who/what scenarios by order of potential appearance, spanning from now to 20 years. A chart positioning various use cases for quantum computing, from fundamental research to applied research and business operations. Current NISQ solutions seem to fare well in the first category. Future FTQC algorithms will probably bring some exponential speedups and improved results in the second category. The third one based on optimization and machine learning algorithms is more challenging at this point. Source: slides. You now understand why CEOs and commenters don’t look at the same target. Their wording and definitions are imprecise. BSI is focusing on cryptanalysis, so, as a threshold, breaking an RSA-2048 key using Shor integer factoring, while Jensen Huang talked about the fuzzy notion of useful quantum computers, probably thinking about doing stuff that is out of reach of existing and future classical systems. And when D-Wave touts quantum supremacy, it’s about implementing some physical simulation that happens to be useless for all companies. As a result, the irrelevance and standard deviation of all these CEO predictions are pretty high. But claiming that “the utility era is here” is clearly an overpromise, particularly, with mentioning the capability to solve some “real-world chemistry problem” with… two logical qubits! What is the difference between a use case and… a use case? Crafted in 1982, the notion of vaporware described a software or hardware product that was announced but released much later or even never released. One famous vaporware was the first version of Microsoft Windows that was announced in 1983 but released only in 1985. In the quantum world, this would be like releasing a product at the speed of light. Is quantum computing a modern version of vaporware? No! We have interesting algorithms and software that could provide some potential benefit. They “just” lack the quantum hardware to be executed and deployed. This explains why we have so many application “use cases” which are not real “use cases”. Most quantum computing use cases are small-scale prototype algorithms that are tested either in emulation mode or with NISQ quantum computers, often in a regime using so few qubits that they could be emulated on a simple laptop. In that situation, a laptop or simple server would be a more efficient solution with regards to computing time and solution cost. These use cases are frequently presented as “industry use cases”, which is ambiguous. It may mean “for the industry”, but not “in production”. Unfortunately, most of these use cases do not describe well the conditions to obtain some quantum advantage (problem size, number and quality of qubits, etc.). It even happens with scientific use cases like this recent one that is using a mere 16-qubit QPU. Use cases in analysts parlance, source: McKinsey. In 2023! These “use cases” can start to become interesting when they reach a regime where a classical quantum code emulation is impossible, even using tensor networks compression, when no equivalent classical solution can deliver a similar result in a reasonable time and when it is using real-life data sets. So far, this seems to be not yet possible for industry applications. When it happens, it sits in the “applied research” zone and not in the “industry utility” zone. It seems we’ll have to wait for FTQC QPUs to enable real-life industry use cases. For more insights on this, I published a framework to analyze use cases back in October 2023. Why are the first quantum utility use cases about simulating condensed matter physics at 0K and not solving your business problem? Simulating spin-glass models is easier with D-Wave annealers because they are themselves implementing spin models (below). Gate-based computers like the ones from IBM are also adapted to the implementation of spin models due among other things to their qubit layout. This is inline with the famous Richard Feynman’s motivation to build a quantum computer in 1981, laid out in the 1982 paper: Simulating Physics with Computers (22 pages). But chemical simulations are about simulating so-called fermionic models, when both gate-based and analog quantum computers are implementing bosonic models. As a result, computational problems that are not natively formulated as spin problems or bosonic problems need some conversion, which incurs a significant classical and quantum computing overhead. It is the same with solving combinatorial optimization problems. They can be mapped on quantum annealers or quantum analog simulators, but with some significant “embedding” overhead. All this explains why other problems require larger quantum computers, with our current knowledge of quantum algorithms. Hopefully, quantum hardware and algorithms are making progress and folks are still hopeful to find some Holy Grail there. What are the challenges of building utility-grade quantum computers? As a cofounder of the Quantum Energy Initiative with an engineering background and perspective, I am looking at the challenges ahead to build utility-grade quantum computers, particularly in the FTQC regime. Understanding, evaluating and optimizing the energetics of these systems must be based on a holistic scientific and engineering perspective, up to looking at the economics of quantum computers. This complements a bottom-up approach that is focused on determining the fundamental bounds of qubits operations, belonging to the fields of quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics. In the second QEI Workshop held in Grenoble in January 2025, I had a chance to provide a view on current quantum computing roadmaps and their energetics aspects (video, slides). In this talk, I inventoried some challenges and connected them to dozens of scientific and engineering questions: I should add here various other scalability challenges like handling data preparation efficiently, particularly for solving linear equations and quantum machine learning tasks. Then, we are still in search of some potential qRAM, a memory type that is nearly mandatory to execute oracle-based algorithms. Then, each qubit type (or “modality”) has its own scalability challenges. They can be very different. For example, solid-state qubits like superconducting and silicon-spin qubits are fighting against decoherence, noise and crosstalk whereas photonic qubits are hampered by low photonic sources and detector efficiencies and losses along the paths in photonic integrated circuits and optical fibers. These are very different scientific and engineering challenges. What is the current TRL of quantum computers? A TRL, aka, technology readiness level, is a metric from 1 to 9 defined by NASA in the mid-1970s. It characterizes the level of maturity of a given technology or product. 1 stands for an idea in the head of a researcher and 9 for a widely deployed technology like your smartphone or laptop computer. In between are physical experiments, prototype products and the first products being deployed. The TRL of a product can also be characterized by the readiness of its related ecosystem (training, skills, applications, documented deployed case studies). Let’s consider the quantum TRL scale created by Kristel Michielsen in 2018, as shown below. According to this scale, quantum annealer’s TRL sits around 7 while gate-based systems are at around 5 given they are not yet commercially implementing quantum error correction. You can still buy a gate-based QPU with over a hundred physical qubit, like Cleveland Clinic who acquired a System One from IBM and installed it in Spring 2023, You can use them in the cloud through AWS, Microsoft, IBM or D-Wave online services. You can learn quantum programming and test your code. Even D-Wave has an (undocumented) SLA (service level agreement) should you use their online QPUs for production. There are already tens of thousands of quantum developers worldwide thanks to these systems being available online. You can test a 127-qubit IBM Eagle-generation QPU for free. But the TRL is also currently quite low when considering the usefulness of quantum computers with regards to their added value and cost. Let’s say you test an online quantum computer with 20 operational noisy qubits. The system probably costs several $Ms and its hourly usage is charged at about $2K. But $2K is the price of a laptop where you could run your quantum code in a free open source emulator. And it would even run faster than on the quantum computer. For a higher number of qubits on a current noisy quantum computer, the situation is blurred depending on your use case as explained when responding to the previous question. So, technically, quantum computers (QPU) TRL sits at around 5-8 depending on the case, but their actual value is still low compared to legacy classical systems. Are NISQ computers useful for the industry? NISQ computers are the current noisy qubit quantum computers. Those you can buy, rent or test today. The current wisdom is that, while they have some scientific value, their industry value is questionable. This is John Preskill’s view. I described NISQ challenges in a 2023 paper, and things have not significantly changed since then. The main NISQ recent advances come from some improvements in qubit numbers and fidelities, with both superconducting and ions qubits, and from the use of quantum error mitigation, a technique promoted among others by IBM. Some use cases are presented, like with the interesting work from Algorithmiq, a software startup based in Finland. A broad industry and academic team led by Sabrina Maniscalco, who is the CEO of Algorithmiq, published a paper willing to fight some myths on NISQ: Myths around quantum computation before full fault tolerance: What no-go theorems rule out and what they don’t by Zoltán Zimborás, Fernando G. S. L. Brandão, Elica Kyoseva, Ivano Tavernelli, Sabrina Maniscalco et al, arXiv, January 2025 (11 pages). It tried to show that the power and use cases of NISQ with quantum error mitigation could be expanded thanks to the upcoming improvements of qubit fidelities. However, the paper leaves the question open of whether NISQ systems will deliver some exponential or practical speedups. Another open question is lingering about the potential known and unknown limits of analog quantum computing. What is it to be pessimistic or optimistic? First, you need to understand where we are and to identify the scientific and engineering challenges ahead. Some are workable, others are really hard. It never necessarily means that “it’s impossible”. It is up to scientists and engineers to find solutions. You then need to appreciate how long it could take, understanding for example the lengths of the manufacturing-testing-experimenting cycles that dominate in this industry. These cycles are long! Usually, the more you know a topic, the less optimistic you may become because you understand the sheer weight of the challenges ahead. It can lead to sheer pessimism. Listening to educated pessimists should be used to challenge the optimists. But you can also be excited by these challenges and by human creativity. That’s my situation. I try to avoid flirting with optimism or pessimism, which are just two opposite moods. I stick to the scientific state of the art and remaining challenges. My own belief is that by doing so, you are neither pessimistic nor optimistic, you are just neutral with some optimism bias even though the pure optimists will perceive you as being a pessimist. So, pessimism or skepticism? Source. When you identify challenges in the quantum computing space, and there are many, most of them are currently being addressed in multiple ways by scientists and industry vendors. What can make you optimistic is that multiple technologies are being developed, like with the types of qubits or even with all the varieties of quantum algorithms around. How to grade the related scientific vs technology uncertainty? A common wisdom with many physicists, including the Nobel in physics laureates I met in Lindau in July 2024 is that the challenges ahead are mainly about engineering and technology developments. According to them, the theory is accepted and proven. But some scientists, like Alain Aspect, also think that creating large scale quantum computers may require significant time, a bit like the LIGO gravitational waves detection experiment which took about 25 years from design to completion (from 1989 to 2015). I do not entirely agree with that focus on engineering. While for sure, engineering and technology developments are inescapable routes to building fault-tolerant quantum computers, there are still some scientific uncertainties to unfold. A bit like the whole history of physics, experimenting new artificial settings will uncover new mysteries which may require building new theories, a bit like Zeeman’s effect discovered in 1896 could be explained only about 30 years later with electron spins. Here, we don’t know yet what we will discover when creating large-scale physical qubit systems. Will they showcase high-fidelity entanglement states at scale? How will we characterize it? Will we reach the famous Heisenberg cut, when macroscopic systems stop behaving quantumly with coherence and behave classically without it? Will we face the effects of the Lieb-Robinson bound that conditions the speed of correlation propagation in large scale entangled systems? It may affect large QPUs, particularly those which are implemented using quantum interconnect techniques. The confusion may come from the difference between theory and science in general. Quantum physics theory may be somewhat settled, but fundamental research and experimental research is still an open field. Another huge quantum computing scientific uncertainty lies with algorithms. We don’t have that many quantum algorithms and even fewer quantum algorithms with provable exponential speedups, or practical speedups with reasonable times. There is still a lot of fundamental research to do there. It is likewise with quantum error correction. How about new sources of correlated errors that we’ll discover with scalable systems and for which current error correction codes are not well adapted? In the technology realm, we don’t know yet if the improvement of chips manufacturing processes will yield better quality qubits. We need to test it. At last, how about various “unknown unknowns”? I’d say quantum computing is becoming a broad scientific experimental endeavor, mixing theoretical and experimental advances, one helping the other. We need these experiments to validate the theory and/or to extend it. We also need to accept failures and try various technology avenues. That’s why it doesn’t yet make much sense to launch a Manhattan like project on a specific qubit modality. It explains for example why DARPA is funding about 11 different such avenues as part of its Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) and Quantum Benchmark Initiative programs. What is the cost of trying these various avenues? Is it acceptable? It is currently mainly supported by a mix of public and private investments with a high proportion of the former. It will go on like this if the strategic stakes are perceived as being as high as they are today. A bird’s eye view on the realizations (green), challenges (orange/red), variations (grey) and paths to scalability (blue) for seven qubit types: superconducting, silicon, topological, cavities, cold atoms and trapped ions. They are all different! Source: Understanding Quantum Technologies 2024. Is the pace of progress of quantum computing accelerating? The perception of acceleration comes from industry vendor hyperbolic communication. Recent news pushed by large companies like Google and Microsoft are driving this impression. Microsoft oversold its topological qubit, that are supposedly around the corner. They are not! Too many scientific or industry communications are about “getting closer to scalable quantum computing” (example 1, example 2, example 3). I don’t believe there is some acceleration. There is progress for sure, but no acceleration. First and foremost, how do you measure acceleration and speed of progress? What is the comparable? What is the meter and unit? One way to proceed is to compare what scientific and technological advances have been achieved vs past plans. When I started working in the quantum computing space in 2018, I tracked the following announcements: Rigetti was planning to release a 128 qubit QPU in 2019, IonQ was mentioning that it had controlled 160 qubits on which it could handle operations on 79 qubits, and Intel was showcasing a silicon chip with the capacity to host 1,500 qubits in a chip thinner than a human hair. In 2019, Google had a 53 qubit chip (Sycamore) and IBM, a 65 qubit chip (Hummingbird r1). Where are we now, 6 to 7 years later? Rigetti’s best chip is Ankaa-3 with 84 qubits. IonQ is at 36 qubits with its Forte system while Intel has a vague 12-qubit chip named Tunnel Falls released in 2023, that is not integrated in a full QPU system. Google reached 105 qubits with its Willow chip announced between August and December 2024 and IBM has a 156-qubit chip. Meanwhile, these qubits fidelities have somewhat improved but not in a stellar way. IBM’s 433 Osprey and 1,121 Condor qubit chips which were released in late 2022 and 2023 were even discontinued in favor of smaller chips (Heron 156 qubits) due to their lack of tunable couplers. With these couplers, IBM’s Heron is faring well, at about 99.7% two-qubit gate fidelities, not far from what is currently achieved with trapped-ions (99.84% at Quantinuum with its H2-1 system). Still, all this doesn’t look like being exponential. It proved more challenging to increase the number of qubits of decent quality at intermediate scales of about a hundred physical qubits. You can see the trend in the updated scatter plot below. The blue dots are about superconducting qubits and the green ones with trapped ions. Cold atoms in orange seem to scale well but have a hard time exceeding two-qubit gate fidelities of 99.5%. Ions achieve that, faring at >99.8% but are still struggling with scaling. Superconducting qubits are in-between, with 99.7% two-qubit gate fidelities at between 105 and 156 physical qubits. In other qubit modalities, progress looked faster, like with cold atoms, first on large settings like Pasqal with the control of 828 atoms in 2024, and Caltech with 6,100 atoms, and then in gate-based mode (QuEra, starting in December 2023 with 48 basic logical qubits, Atom Computing with 24 logical qubits in November 2024). Photonic qubits are either locked at low qubit count in the non-scalable KLM paradigm (Quandela, Orca Computing, …) or are bound to implement FTQC scalable architecture in the more or less distant future (again with Quandela, with PsiQuantum, and Xanadu). Since 2018, we’ve also seen the emergence of new breeds of qubits implementing some autonomous error correction, like the cat-qubits from Alice&Bob and AWS, or the GKP qubits from Nord Quantique. These are encouraging new technology developments that may reduce the physical per logical qubits number overhead. There are several technical limitations to the # of qubits per monolithic quantum processors. It leads their designers to envision using various quantum interconnect solutions (microwaves, optical photons, transduction), which will bring a wealth of new challenges, from physics to quantum code compiling and optimization. We thus have to be very careful when extrapolating physical qubit numbers, particularly toward million qubit ranges. While there was significant progress in the field of quantum error correction, these advances were not well interpreted. For example, Google Willow’s logical qubit only corrects errors in a quantum memory, but not single or two qubit logical gate errors. It is thus far from being “fault-tolerant”. Likewise, the logical qubits created by QuEra and Quantinuum (with Microsoft) implement logical gates, but with the non-scalable trick of “post-selection”. It has the flavor of quantum error mitigation implemented in post-processing manner more than a fault-tolerant scheme adapted to running large quantum circuits. As I described in my Moore’s paper in 2023, scaling QPUs won’t probably follow any Moore’s law like with CMOS semiconductors because the scalability challenges are highly multidimensional. It’s not just a matter of shrinking transistors. I simplify things here since advances in CMOS were more complicated than that. Also, the test & learn cycles with various quantum computing technologies are relatively slow and don’t follow any Moore’s law. However, we may underappreciate some interesting technology developments happening in the background that will pay off later: on cryogenic control electronics, on high-density cabling, control signals multiplexing, high-power and low phase noise lasers, and with high-power cryogenics. The Coyote and Road Runner. A famous Warner cartoon known by boomers. Image source. Now, who’s who here? The Coyote may represent quantum computers while road runner is classical computing. And maybe, someday, it will be the other way around. What is special about quantum computing with regard to predictions? In the not-so-distant past, predictions abounded about how fast a technology revolution would be adopted. The cloud, mobile computing, Internet of things, and more recently the metaverse. Artificial intelligence made its comeback in two periods, one between 2012 and 2022 with machine learning and deep learning around data science concepts, and since 2022, with the advent of LLM-based chatbots. In these domains, the technology was more or less mature, but it had proven use cases that were beyond the state of the art. For example, mobile computing and cloud computing brought usability and easy access to multi-format communication on the go. In other domains like with IoT and metaverses, the generic user value was neither obvious nor universal. The uncertainties in these various domains were however not so much about the underlying science and technology, than on other factors: costs, ease of use, user value, physiological acceptability in the case of the metaverse, social impact and so on. With quantum computing, we are exposed to a flurry of market predictions including how much value it could generate, around $2T as soon as 2035 according to McKinsey before even the technology is ready. Even if it was ready in 2025, it would take more than 10 years to yield such value. You’d have to deploy it, to create algorithms, to run it, to try different options to create a digital twin of a new drug or chemical compound candidate. Then, you’d have to test it in the real world, either undertaking multi-year clinical tests or launching the buildout of new manufacturing plants. And so on. This takes time! McKinsey quantum monitor as of April 2024. Notice the $42B total government investment which is wrong due to bad estimated of China’s investments as well explained in The Quantum Panic – The U.S. wants to be prepared for whatever quantum technologies bring, but is it time to rightsize the threat from China? by Rachel Cheung, The Wire China, February 2025. How can we compare today’s situation and uncertainties with quantum computing to the ones we had 30 years ago or so in other domains? There were not many doubts back then about the progress ahead with raw computing power, memory, storage and networking capabilities growth. Moore’s law was kind of predictable, at least until the mid-2000s. Telecom infrastructures were key for developing the Internet and for smartphones and the cloud. There were some infrastructure built out delays for fiber installation around the world. However, this was not due to uncertainty in scientific or technology. It was more an economic issue. Also, many Internet developments benefited from the technology but were accelerated for societal reasons, like with the advent of the web 2.0 around 2004. There are some parallels to draw here with FTQC QPUs. At some point, they will become heavyweight infrastructure programs requiring significant funding, beyond classical research funding in the academic and startup world. In our analysis, we are often affected by a “survival bias”. We use the example of successes as proof of our reasoning, forgetting past failures. They don’t resonate in memories since they didn’t affect us much. In the mid-1980s, there was some buzz on GaAs electronics, that was supposed to supplant CMOS. It didn’t, mostly for engineering and economic reasons. Nanomaterials and graphene technologies had similar troubles, ranging from scientific and technology overpromises and societal backlash. Classical analog computing was promoted in the 1960s to 1970s but failed, being overcome by digital computing. It was not generic enough and didn’t scale well due to noise. Quantum computers are also analog to some extent, of course, with analog quantum systems ala Pasqal and D-Wave, but also with NISQ systems implementing arbitrary rotation gates. One key difference is that FTQC mixes analog and discrete operation, which is to enable quantum error correction, a feat that was not accessible to classical analog computers. Also, analog computing didn’t benefit from the same attention and public investments as we have right now with quantum computing. There was no equivalent of Shor’s algorithm to drive government interest. The EAI 8800 Analog computing system in 1986. Source. By the way, where are we with the promises of the Hyperloop, promoted by a certain Elon Musk in a 2013 white paper? Several ambitious infrastructure projects were supposed to be launched around the world. A couple startups were created. Twelve years later, it’s not really in the radar. The idea is plagued with a mix of engineering problems, safety problems, capacity and economic limitations and huge infrastructure costs. How about drones flying around to transport passengers from airports to cities? They can indeed fly. But with limited range, air trafic control challenges, economic challenges again, and so on. Now, let’s consider the Apollo program. It took only 8 years from JFK’s speech in May 1961 to Congress to having men landing on the Moon in July 1969. Yuri Gagarine had been sent to space a couple weeks earlier, in April. JFK confirmed the goal in another speech in September 1962, listing some technical challenges. Weeks from the start of the Cuban missiles crisis! Of course, the Moon quest project was fueled by huge investments but it was mostly about solving technology challenges. In 1961, engineers already knew how to launch a rocket and send a human into space. Newton’s laws were already vindicated. But there was the Cold War between the USA-USSR rivalry. Quantum computing seems much different and more challenging than all the above examples from the scientific and engineering perspective. There are superposed stacks of uncertainties from securing large scale entanglement to designing useful algorithm, and with relatively long test and learn cycles. And we have not yet started the real economical discussion about the price of these systems and their return on investment. From the scientific and engineering standpoint, quantum computing seems closer to nuclear fusion. Both are linked to the limits of physics and experimentation. The advantage of quantum computing is that it is way less capex intensive than nuclear fusion. At least at this point. Will quantum computers run LLMs more efficiently than classical computers? Some quantum computing companies like IonQ and Quantinuum are flirting with the idea that quantum computers may someday run LLMs more efficiently than classical computers. They could even be more energy efficient. What investors got from some IonQ presentation in 2024. Source. Unfortunately, quantum computers will probably not help mitigate the growth of energy consumption linked to consumer LLM based-generative AI. Data loading is quantum computers’ Achilles’ heel and will remain so for a long time given they will unlikely benefit from some hardware Moore’s law in relation to their clock speed. Given the size of both the training data (in petabytes and tera-tokens encoded in highly multidimensional vectors) and models (in tera-parameters), they won’t be loaded at a reasonable timescale on any quantum computer for training, even with some classical data ingestion and preparation. Variable computing and energetic costs are mostly in inferences which are run nearly real-time. Any quantum algorithms running in a quantum advantage regime will probably not be real-time. We can also use some simple logic here. An inference would require one quantum computer and there are hundreds of millions of users of these LLM chatbots. Unless some clever algorithm enables multiple inferences to run on single QPUs, this can’t scale well. There are no available resource estimates on how some FTQC quantum computers could handle any LLM task. The path to quantum transformers by David Wakeham, Xanadu, April 2024, provides sketchy classical and quantum computing requirements to train LLMs. It shows that even with very optimistic assumptions on the clock speed of quantum computers (in GHz), and with several tens of thousands of logical qubits, quantum computers would be faster than classical computers for the embedding part of LLM only after a couple decades, but this task could be run classically and only kernel operations handled quantumly (linear operations using block-encode matrices). Quantum linear algebra is all you need for Transformer architectures by Naixu Guo, Zhan Yu, Matthew Choi, Aman Agrawal, Kouhei Nakaji, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, and Patrick Rebentrost, arXiv, February-May 2024 (31 pages) states that “embedding large data into quantum computers is difficult in the absence of the availability of functioning quantum RAMs”. So maybe, we should invent the notion of qSLM for quantum small language models! However, the broader field of quantum artificial intelligence, not including LLMs for consumer chatbots, is a good exploration path, particularly when there is a need to use smaller data for training and to obtain better accuracy in inferences. Quantum machine learning can potentially be used for both training and inferences. There are still many technology interdependencies here: on data preparation and on the development of qRAM and on the connection between classical and quantum components of an AI solution. One thing is sure: classical AI already helps develop quantum technologies, in quantum error mitigation, quantum error correction at the error syndrome detection level, qubit calibration, and even circuit design (using custom Transformers). How about the if/when mantra? Analysts and others are frequently parroting the “if not when” mantra, saying that the question is not if scalable quantum computers will appear but when. As shown above, there are still many “ifs” which explain a lot of the uncertainty on the “when”. Otherwise, we would have an infinite certainty on the “when”. It is a bit like if “if” and “when” were complementary observables in Niels Bohr’s parlance. And due to Heisenberg indeterminacy principle, you can’t be precise on both observables. So if you dare want to be a bit more precise on the “when”, you need to be less accurate on the “if”. Should I wait, or should I go? That’s the typical question for end-user companies. Some analysts are playing with FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) to drive customers on the quantum computing bandwagon: human skills and quantum computing resources will be scarce, there will be a significant first-mover advantage, and your competitiveness will highly depend on your adoption of quantum technologies. I don’t believe any of these assertions to be true or verifiable. If quantum computers work at scale and benefit customers, hardware vendors will manufacture them and sell them. In the history of technology, even for large systems like supercomputers, there’s never been a real scarcity problem. And if there was one, it would mean that scalable quantum computers are way too large and costly. Then, human skills can follow-on. We already have a good stream of young people being trained. Finally, your competitiveness may only marginally depend on quantum computing. Some early adopters of quantum computing in Europe across multiple verticals: energy utilities, chemicals, telecoms, financial services, air/defense, automotive and transportation. Source: OE. Still, I would advise customers to invest in quantum computing. Am I contradicting myself? No, I’m just basing my rationale on different arguments. One is that testing quantum computing is not expensive and is part of any techno-screening of any large company. You don’t need to acquire a $40M QPU. You can rent it for cheap in the cloud. You can even learn quantum coding with free open source emulators. Second, learning quantum computing is an excellent way to revisit your existing applications portfolio. It helps you identify pain points in scalability or output quality, revisiting the algorithms you are using. At some point, it will help you modernize your IT, and not necessarily with quantum computing. You may land in using GPUs and/or tensor network “quantum inspired” classical applications. Learning about quantum computing can help you upgrade your algorithms teams. It will push them to develop better mathematical skills, like in the financial services vertical. It will also help customers deal with the aggressive push from industry vendors and to decipher the continuous news stream. In just one week, you’ll have thousand of talks from quantum physicists at the APS March Meeting held in Anaheim, and the Nvidia Quantum Computing Day in San Francisco, hosting a dozen quantum computing vendors. Get ready for a flurry of announcements! Of course, another minimal task to launch is the audit and upgrade of the company cybersecurity infrastructure. Whether you like it or not, you’ll have to fold in deploying post-quantum cryptography. So, learn quantum computing at small scale, educate your own technical people, try small things, be ready to adopt the technology should quantum computing scale well on a reasonable time horizon. How to interpret the quantum stocks’ ups and downs? In Summer 2024, Rigetti and D-Wave risked being delisted from the Nasdaq due to their stock becoming for some time a “penny stock”, valued at less than a US dollar. But in October 2024, they escaped this dangerous zone. Then, Google’s Willow PR blitz in December 2024 drove the stock to sky highs. It happened also with IonQ’s stock, which was not endangered. In January 2025, Jensen Huang’s declaration created a sharp drop in value for all these stocks and they rebounded relatively fast afterwards, then fell down again, and are up again since the beginning of March 2025. What was the rationale here? You may wonder. Google Willow advancements had no connection at all with IonQ’s roadmap. Rigetti is a direct technology competitor of Google, but lagging behind it. And D-Wave? It’s been struggling for a while at generating some decent revenue. And the company is now over 25-year old. It seems to be a rare case of a company losing money for such a long time, although it became public only in 2022. These stock values are driven by a mix of volatile human sentiments and machine-based automated triggers. Chart showing Rigetti, IonQ and D-Wave stock value evolution over one sliding year (source). Now let’s have some fun and look at the roadmaps, past revenue forecasts and actual results for these traded companies, which all went public using the shady SPAC funding vehicle. Rigetti’s 2021 roadmap announced that they would obtain a “broad quantum advantage” in 2025. How many use cases do they have with their 84-qubit QPUs? Not many, besides some QEC experiment with Riverlane announced in October 2024. Their qubit quality is too bad to do useful NISQ stuff, even with using quantum error mitigation. Their revenue projection was $73M for 2024 and $288M for 2025. In March 2025, they reported a revenue of $10.7 for 2024, while 2023 was at $12M. And a loss of $201M! D-Wave’s 2022 investor presentation was forecasting a revenue of $72M in 2024 and $219 for 2025. Actual revenue for 2024 was $8.8M while 2023 was at $8.7M. Not stellar exponential growth either! In its 2021 investor presentation, IonQ planned to reach 64 “algorithmic qubits” by 2025 with a 16:1 error-correction encoding, meaning a thousand physical qubits if I count well. And 2024 revenues of $60M. The actual was not that far, with $43M, although, mostly thanks to US federal commitments from AFRL. And they currently have only 36 operational qubits. The wake-up call for investors is hard, as shown in Kerrisdal Capital’s recent short-selling and well-documented report! Now, they just acquired IDQ with a $250M stock swap with SK Telecom. The rationale? Revenue diversification and patent portfolio consolidation! That’s not a pretty picture from the investor standpoint. We must recognize that all startups have the same problem. They make inflated sales forecasts to attract investors and then usually fail to deliver it. The big difference here is that this is not linked to some sales or competition shortcomings, or lack of some viral effects like in web consumer space, but because the technology is not yet there to capture the target market. Still, the market value of these companies totals over $10B ($3.15B for D-Wave, $2.75B for Rigetti, and $5.41B for IonQ). I have observed how IonQ investors on X were disappointed by the company’s quarterly results. Seemingly, they didn’t talk much with scientists and technology specialists to forge an educated opinion about the company. All investors are misled by a superposition of over-expectations: on the potential business value of quantum computers (culprits: McKinsey and BCG), on the related revenue opportunity (culprits: same folks), on the technology roadmap (culprits: most vendors and analysts, including Google and Microsoft), and on the difficulty of creating useful quantum computers. In comparison, IBM looks like a sane player, being more careful with its promises and roadmaps. Now, these three traded companies are not the best-in-class QPU vendors around. There are many other vendors who are not yet traded. Some are advancing their R&D quietly, avoid overselling their hardware, and adopt a long-term ploy. They benefit from a mix of private and public funding, including public procurements like with the EuroHPC program in the European Union. Conclusion The quantum scene is becoming the theater of double-speak with utility, use case, industry-grade, acceleration, if, and when, where the present and the future collide in the public discourse. Thanks for reading this paper until the end. What key question did I miss out?

Americans aren't thrilled about the economy. Business Insider has heard from retirees watching their investments fluctuate in the stock market, parents struggling with the high cost of groceries and childcare, and business leaders bracing for a downturn. This comes alongside the Trump administration's roller-coaster tariff announcements and sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. The US may not be in a recession yet — but we are in a vibecession. This growing distrust could have serious consequences, as a fear-driven pullback in spending is one step toward an actual downturn. Cynical shoppers may avoid nonessential purchases, businesses could pause hiring, and investors might step back from the market. And the slower the economy, the weaker it becomes. "There's a massive amount of uncertainty that's really weighing on people," said Joanne Hsu, who oversees the closely watched University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, which in March dropped to its lowest point in three years. "People are really worried that these policies are going to lead to a resurgence in inflation. We're seeing a deterioration in views related to the overall economy, which is related to personal finances, inflation, and most critically, labor markets." The vibecession rears its head whenever Americans are feeling particularly uncertain about the economy. Even if the major economic indicators aren't alarming on paper, rapid changes on Wall Street and in the White House historically make consumers and businesses nervous. Many consumers are worried about how federal policy will shape the cost of essentials such as groceries and housing. The Consumer Sentiment Index — which is based on surveys and interviews with hundreds of US adults by researchers at the University of Michigan — decreased by 16.1 points between December and March. That's the sharpest three-month drop since the pandemic began in 2020. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has climbed over 60 points since December, a much higher-than-typical jump. The measure is based on how often major media outlets are reporting on economic uncertainty, the frequency of disagreement among economic forecasters, and other factors. The research firm Civiqs also found that over a quarter of Americans believe the economy is doing "very bad" right now. Google searches for "recession" have spiked in the past 30 days. Among consumers, Trump is losing ground on what has historically been his — and the GOP's — strongest issue. The majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second-term job performance on the economy (54% disapprove) and how he's handling inflation and cost of living (55% disapprove), per an NBC News poll published March 16. "If people both think the economy is deteriorating and they expect their own incomes to weaken as well, it's hard to imagine how robust consumer spending can really be under those circumstances," Hsu said. Businesses aren't escaping the vibescession either. Many CEOs and executives are worried that the economic uncertainty will put a damper on profits, hiring, and growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that general business conditions, new orders and shipments, employment levels, and financial optimism have all declined among businesses across the state in 2025. "Small businesses have particularly few options and little wiggle room to deal with the sheer size of the tariffs in the pipeline," Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG, told BI in an email. "They both squeeze profits margins and prompt cuts to staff, while boosting prices." At the C-Suite level, some companies' plans for hiring and capital investment, as well as sales projections, have decreased since Trump's inauguration, a survey of 150 CEOs by Business Roundtable found. Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten wrote in the March survey report that the downward trends are based on "several factors, including signs of economic headwinds and an atmosphere of uncertainty in Washington." Vibecessions aren't new. Consumer sentiment also dipped during and shortly after the pandemic and again ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Instability in the stock market, high inflation, and job losses often lead to widespread financial anxiety. Still, Americans' current pessimism about the economy is notable. The present vibecession comes in the context of declines in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq in recent weeks. While the markets have shown some signs of recovery, they remain well below their February highs. Trump's steep — and quickly shifting — tariff policies have also left US businesses and consumers expecting a significant jump in prices for things like food, construction materials, electronics, and alcohol. Inflation has eased from its post-pandemic highs, but many shoppers feel like their budgets are stretched thin. The chaos around the availability and cost of eggs, for example, has become a symbol of overall inflation fears. The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have added to that uncertainty by firing thousands of federal workers and slashing the budgets of several government programs. Layoffs also hit major companies like Meta, Amazon, Southwest, and others in rapid succession, further fueling the public's perception of economic turmoil. This comes as the white-collar job market has been increasingly difficult to break into, despite overall unemployment rates holding steady. Hsu told BI that consumer sentiment patterns typically fall along party lines — Democrats feel more economically confident when the president is a Democrat, and Republicans more confident under Republican administrations. But in the past few months, consumer sentiment has significantly declined among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. The US isn't in a true recession. Economists and financial analysts told BI that economic downturns are measured on several factors, including long-term labor market and consumer spending data. A few weeks of stock market and policy instability aren't enough to call a recession. Still, even if the US economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession changes consumer behavior. People are likely to tighten their spending on nonessentials and delay major purchases, which could disrupt the travel industry and the housing market. Some small businesses and major corporations have also signaled that they plan to pass the price of Trump's tariffs onto consumers, which could contribute to shoppers buying less. "Moral of the story is that when uncertainty spikes, we tend to err on the side of caution and delay big spending decisions," Swonk said. "We are seeing that base emotion play out in real time in the overall economy." Retirees and hopeful retirees told BI that they are adjusting their stock market and 401(k) investments to be more conservative. Hsu said job seekers may also become less likely to leave their current jobs or seek outside promotions, affecting labor market churn. The stock market has shown signs of recovery in the past few days, but America's latest vibecession isn't over — and the future is hard to predict. "We're in a really unprecedented policy environment," Hsu said. "With policy changing every day, and every hour in some situations, it's really hard for consumers to plan in a meaningful way."

At its annual developer conference GTC in San Jose, Calif. today (Mar. 18), Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled two upcoming GPU architectures: Blackwell Ultra and Rubin. During his opening keynote, CEO Jensen Huang laid out the chipmaker’s ambitious vision to propel A.I. into an era of industrial-scale computing. Huang called GTC the “Super Bowl of A.I.”—with one key distinction: “At this Super Bowl, everyone wins,” he said. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. Blackwell Ultra is expected to launch in the second half of 2025. Its successor, Rubin, is slated for late 2026, followed by the more advanced Rubin Ultra in 2027. Currently in production, Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra series is an advanced iteration of the Blackwell chips unveiled at last year’s GTC, which are 40 times more powerful than the previous-generation Hopper chips, Huang said. Blackwell Ultra will incorporate eight stacks of 12-Hi HBM4E memory, providing 288GB of onboard memory. The architecture will feature NVLink 72, an upgraded high-speed interconnect technology designed to facilitate communication between GPUs and CPUs—crucial for processing the massive datasets required for A.I. training and inference. “NVLink connects multiple GPUs, turning them into a single GPU,” Huang explained. “It addresses the scale-up problem by enabling massive parallel computing.” In addition, the company unveiled the Nvidia RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition, engineered for enterprise workloads such as multimodal A.I. inference, immersive content creation and scientific computing. With 96GB of GDDR7 memory and support for multi-instance GPU technology, the RTX PRO 6000 is designed to power advanced A.I. development. Blackwell’s successor, Rubin, is named after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter in space. The initial version of the Rubin chip is expected to achieve 50 petaflops of speed during A.I. model execution. The more powerful Rubin Ultra can deliver up to 100 petaflops of performance, which Huang called a “major step forward” in A.I. processing and performance power. Early iterations of the Blackwell chips and racks reportedly faced overheating issues, leading some customers to reduce their orders. The newly introduced liquid-cooled Grace Blackwell 200 NVL72 system addresses these concerns, offering up to 30 times faster real-time inference for trillion-parameter large language models and up to four times faster training compared to Nvidia’s previous-generation H100 GPU. It can generate up to 12,000 tokens per second—the basic units processed by A.I. models—dramatically accelerating both training and inference. “If you want your A.I. to be smarter, it must generate more tokens. That requires massive bandwidth, floating-point operations and memory,” said Huang. He also explained that reasoning A.I. models such as DeepSeek’s R1 model require 20 times more tokens and 105 times more computing power. Nvidia is also collaborating closely with Taiwan’s TSMC to develop data packaging technologies for data centers, a move that could substantially enhance computational efficiency and thermal demands in future GPU generations. Huang also outlined Nvidia’s roadmap beyond Rubin. “The next generation of architectures after Rubin will be named Feynman,” he said, confirming that Feynman HBM is already in development and slated for release in 2028. Named after Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist known for his contributions to quantum mechanics, this upcoming architecture is expected to push A.I. performance to unprecedented levels. The announcements came on the heels of Nvidia’s better-than-expected first-quarter earnings results, driven by a surging demand for its GPUs. Despite increasing competition from rivals like AMD and geopolitical uncertainties including export restrictions on semiconductors, Nvidia currently dominates the global GPU market with an estimated 80 percent market share, according to a report by Nasdaq.

March 18, 2025 18:58 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation. If you invested in Novo Nordisk and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now.

Time Published: 2025-03-18T19:44:00Z

General Motors (GM+0.33%) will rely on Nvidia’s (NVDA-1.05%) artificial intelligence expertise to build its next generation of cars. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the partnership at the company’s annual GTC conference in San Jose, California on Tuesday. “I’m super excited to announce that GM has selected Nvidia to partner with them to build their future self-driving car fleet,” Huang said. GM will use Nvidia’s Drive AGX platform, an in-vehicle computer that delivers “up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of high performance computer,” and includes hardware and software to develop autonomous driving functions as well as immersive in-cabin experiences, according to the press release. The automotive giant will build its next-generation vehicles on the platform, which Nvidia says will speed the development and deployment of safe autonomous vehicles at scale. GM has already been investing in Nvidia graphics processing units for AI model training. As of Tuesday’s announcement, the two companies will expand their partnership to work together to build custom systems to train AI manufacturing models. That also includes optimizing GM’s automotive plant design and operations. To do so, GM will use the Nvidia Omniverse platform to create digital twins of their assembly lines, which will allow for virtual vehicle testing and production simulations. Nvidia will also help GM train robotics platforms already in use for operations, such as precision welding and material handling and transport. “AI not only optimizes manufacturing processes and accelerates virtual testing but also helps us build smarter vehicles while empowering our workforce to focus on craftsmanship,” GM chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a press release. “By merging technology with human ingenuity, we unlock new levels of innovation in vehicle manufacturing and beyond.” GM became the first automaker to offer hands-free driving with the introduction of its Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system in 2017. While the hands-free cars are not completely self-driving cars since the driver might be required to take control if needed, they are a significant step in that direction. Still, the automaker has faced a bumpy road in the world of autonomous driving. In December, the company’s robotaxi service, Cruise, was forced to shut down operations. The decision came on the heels of an external probe into the company for misleading regulators about a 2023 incident in which one of the company’s robotaxis in San Francisco hit a pedestrian. Regardless, the company is optimistic about its path toward delivering safe autonomous vehicles for personal use. “The work we’re doing with companies like Nvidia adds agility to our already highly sophisticated vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing processes,” GM said in the press release. “By further integrating physical and industrial AI applications (including digital twins, simulation, and robotics) we continue to optimize manufacturing, accelerate virtual testing, and ultimately build smarter, more connected vehicles for our customers.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Hims & Hers stock tumbles as the FDA issues a warning about 'unapproved' weight loss drugs
URL: https://qz.com/hims-hers-stock-falls-fda-compounded-glp-1s-1851770807
Time Published: 2025-03-18T19:34:00Z
Full Content:
Hims & Hers (HIMS+5.20%), the millennial-skewed telehealth company, saw its stock tumble nearly 9% on Tuesday, as the company braces for big regulatory shifts in the weight-loss drug industry. Hims stock took a hit just a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated a page on its website outlining its concerns with the use of what it calls “unapproved GLP-1 drugs.” GLP-1 drugs are a class of drugs, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.35%) Ozempic, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. The FDA warned Monday that the use of unapproved versions of these drugs including compounded versions can “be risky for patients, as unapproved versions do not undergo FDA’s review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they are marketed.” Back in May, Hims & Hers started selling compounded semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy — for just $199 a month. That’s a big difference compared to Ozempic’s $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. Compounding means a pharmacy or physician customizes an approved drug to fit an individual patient’s needs. The company’s total sales grew 69% last year to $1.5 billion. Hims & Hers was able to sell this off-brand version because of recent shortages of GLP-1 drugs. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits making drugs that are just copies of commercially available ones. However, when drugs are in shortage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t consider them commercially available. Now that the Ozempic shortage is over, Hims & Hers will have to stop selling “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide this year. The FDA said it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide starting May 22 or after a judge rules on a lawsuit from the industry group Outsourcing Facilities Association — whichever comes later. “We will have to start notifying customers in the coming month or two that they will need to start looking for alternative options on the commercial dosing,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call in February. Still, Hims & Hers has other avenues to explore. The company could continue to offer more personalized semaglutide formulations and shift its focus to older generic weight-loss drugs. Additionally, on Tuesday Bank of America Securities (BAC+0.06%) analyst Allen Lutz adjusted the firm’s price target for Hims & Hers by $1 to $22 — notably $12 below the stock’s opening price that day. Lutz maintained an “underperform” (sell) rating. Lutz noted that while overall sales grew 124% year over year in February, GLP-1 medications now make up about 45% of the company’s online revenue. Meanwhile, growth outside of GLP-1s has slowed, with core sales increasing just 30% in February — down from 40% in the fourth quarter and 47-50% in the third. “Slowing core growth is an important barometer as semaglutide could exit the model at any time and now represents close to 50% of sales,” Lutz wrote.

March 18, 2025 15:13 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC—NVIDIA today announced a major release of new NVIDIA Cosmos™ world foundation models (WFMs), introducing an open and fully customizable reasoning model for physical AI development and giving developers unprecedented control over world generation. NVIDIA is also launching two new blueprints — powered by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ and Cosmos platforms — that provide developers with massive, controllable synthetic data generation engines for post-training robots and autonomous vehicles. Industry leaders including 1X, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, Foretellix, Skild AI and Uber are among the first to adopt Cosmos to generate richer training data for physical AI faster and at scale. “Just as large language models revolutionized generative and agentic AI, Cosmos world foundation models are a breakthrough for physical AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Cosmos introduces an open and fully customizable reasoning model for physical AI and unlocks opportunities for step-function advances in robotics and the physical industries.” Cosmos Transfer for Synthetic Data GenerationCosmos Transfer WFMs ingest structured video inputs such as segmentation maps, depth maps, lidar scans, pose estimation maps and trajectory maps to generate controllable photoreal video outputs. Cosmos Transfer streamlines perception AI training, transforming 3D simulations or ground truth created in Omniverse into photorealistic videos for large-scale, controllable synthetic data generation. Agility Robotics will be an early adopter of Cosmos Transfer and Omniverse for large-scale synthetic data generation to train its robot models. “Cosmos offers us an opportunity to scale our photorealistic training data beyond what we can feasibly collect in the real world,” said Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer of Agility Robotics. “We’re excited to see what new performance we can unlock with the platform, while making the most use of the physics-based simulation data we already have.” The NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for autonomous vehicle simulation uses Cosmos Transfer to amplify variations of physically based sensor data. With the blueprint, Foretellix can enhance behavioral scenarios by varying conditions like weather and lighting for diverse driving datasets. Parallel Domain is also using the blueprint to apply similar variation to its sensor simulation. The NVIDIA GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation combines Omniverse and Cosmos Transfer to generate diverse datasets at scale, benefiting from OpenUSD-powered simulations and reducing data collection and augmentation time from days to hours. Cosmos Predict for Intelligent World GenerationAnnounced at the CES trade show in January, Cosmos Predict WFMs generate virtual world states from multimodal inputs like text, images and video. New Cosmos Predict models will enable multi-frame generation, predicting intermediate actions or motion trajectories when given start and end input images. Purpose-built for post-training, these models can be customized using NVIDIA’s openly available physical AI dataset. With the inference compute power of NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 systems and their large NVIDIA NVLink™ domain, developers can achieve real-time world generation. 1X is using Cosmos Predict and Cosmos Transfer to train its new humanoid robot NEO Gamma. Robot brain developer Skild AI is tapping into Cosmos Transfer to augment synthetic datasets for its robots. Plus, Nexar and Oxa are using Cosmos Predict to advance their autonomous driving systems. Multimodal Reasoning for Physical AI Cosmos Reason is an open, fully customizable WFM with spatiotemporal awareness that uses chain-of-thought reasoning to understand video data and predict the outcomes of interactions — such as a person stepping into a crosswalk or a box falling from a shelf — in natural language. Developers can use Cosmos Reason to improve physical AI data annotation and curation, enhance existing world foundation models or create new vision language action models. They can also post-train it to build high-level planners to tell the physical AI what it needs to do to complete a task. Accelerating Data Curation and Post-Training for Physical AIBased on their downstream task, developers can post-train Cosmos WFMs using native PyTorch scripts or the NVIDIA NeMo™ framework on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud. Cosmos developers can also use NVIDIA NeMo Curator on DGX Cloud for accelerated data processing and curation. Linker Vision and Milestone Systems are using it for curating large amounts of video data to train large vision language models for visual agents built on the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization. Virtual Incision is exploring it to be deployed in future surgical robots, while Uber and Waabi are advancing autonomous vehicles development. Driving Responsible AI and Content TransparencyIn line with NVIDIA’s trustworthy AI principles, NVIDIA enforces open guardrails across all Cosmos WFMs. In addition, NVIDIA is collaborating with Google DeepMind to integrate SynthID to watermark and help identify AI-generated outputs from the Cosmos WFM NVIDIA NIM™ microservice featured on build.nvidia.com.

March 18, 2025 15:08 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a portfolio of technologies to supercharge humanoid robot development, including NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1, the world’s first open, fully customizable foundation model for generalized humanoid reasoning and skills. The other technologies include simulation frameworks and blueprints such as the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for generating synthetic data, as well as Newton, an open-source physics engine — under development with Google DeepMind and Disney Research — purpose-built for developing robots. Available now, GR00T N1 is the first of a family of fully customizable models that NVIDIA will pretrain and release to worldwide robotics developers — accelerating the transformation of industries challenged by global labor shortages estimated at more than 50 million people. “The age of generalist robotics is here,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1 and new data-generation and robot-learning frameworks, robotics developers everywhere will open the next frontier in the age of AI.” GR00T N1 Advances Humanoid Developer CommunityThe GR00T N1 foundation model features a dual-system architecture, inspired by principles of human cognition. “System 1” is a fast-thinking action model, mirroring human reflexes or intuition. “System 2” is a slow-thinking model for deliberate, methodical decision-making. Powered by a vision language model, System 2 reasons about its environment and the instructions it has received to plan actions. System 1 then translates these plans into precise, continuous robot movements. System 1 is trained on human demonstration data and a massive amount of synthetic data generated by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform. GR00T N1 can easily generalize across common tasks — such as grasping, moving objects with one or both arms, and transferring items from one arm to another — or perform multistep tasks that require long context and combinations of general skills. These capabilities can be applied across use cases such as material handling, packaging and inspection. Developers and researchers can post-train GR00T N1 with real or synthetic data for their specific humanoid robot or task. In his GTC keynote, Huang demonstrated 1X’s humanoid robot autonomously performing domestic tidying tasks using a post-trained policy built on GR00T N1. The robot’s autonomous capabilities are the result of an AI training collaboration between 1X and NVIDIA. “The future of humanoids is about adaptability and learning,” said Bernt Børnich, CEO of 1X Technologies. “NVIDIA’s GR00T N1 model provides a major breakthrough for robot reasoning and skills. With a minimal amount of post-training data, we were able to fully deploy on NEO Gamma — furthering our mission of creating robots that are not tools, but companions that can assist humans in meaningful, immeasurable ways.” Among the additional leading humanoid developers worldwide with early access to GR00T N1 are Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Mentee Robotics and NEURA Robotics. NVIDIA, Google DeepMind and Disney Research Focus on PhysicsNVIDIA announced a collaboration with Google DeepMind and Disney Research to develop Newton, an open-source physics engine that lets robots learn how to handle complex tasks with greater precision. Built on the NVIDIA Warp framework, Newton will be optimized for robot learning and compatible with simulation frameworks such as Google DeepMind’s MuJoCo and NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab. Additionally, the three companies plan to enable Newton to use Disney’s physics engine. Google DeepMind and NVIDIA are collaborating to develop MuJoCo-Warp, which is expected to accelerate robotics machine learning workloads by more than 70x and will be available to developers through Google DeepMind’s MJX open-source library, as well as through Newton. Disney Research will be one of the first to use Newton to advance its robotic character platform that powers next-generation entertainment robots, such as the expressive Star Wars-inspired BDX droids that joined Huang on stage during his GTC keynote. “The BDX droids are just the beginning. We’re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn't seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, NVIDIA and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,” said Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president at Walt Disney Imagineering Research & Development. “This collaboration will allow us to create a new generation of robotic characters that are more expressive and engaging than ever before — and connect with our guests in ways that only Disney can.” NVIDIA and Disney Research, along with Intrinsic, announced an additional collaboration to build OpenUSD pipelines and best practices for robotics data workflows. More Data to Advance Robotics Post-TrainingLarge, diverse, high-quality datasets are critical for robot development but costly to capture. For humanoids, real-world human demonstration data is limited by a person’s 24-hour day. Announced today, the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation helps address this challenge. Built on Omniverse and NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer world foundation models, the blueprint lets developers generate exponentially large amounts of synthetic motion data for manipulation tasks from a small number of human demonstrations. Using the first components available for the blueprint, NVIDIA generated 780,000 synthetic trajectories — the equivalent of 6,500 hours, or nine continuous months, of human demonstration data — in just 11 hours. Then, combining the synthetic data with real data, NVIDIA improved GR00T N1’s performance by 40%, compared with using only real data. To further equip the developer community with valuable training data, NVIDIA is releasing the GR00T N1 dataset as part of a larger open-source physical AI dataset — also announced at GTC and now available on Hugging Face. AvailabilityNVIDIA GR00T N1 training data and task evaluation scenarios are now available for download from Hugging Face and GitHub. The NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation is also now available as an interactive demo on build.nvidia.com or to download from GitHub. The NVIDIA DGX Spark personal AI supercomputer, also announced today at GTC, provides developers a turnkey system to expand GR00T N1’s capabilities for new robots, tasks and environments without extensive custom programming. The Newton physics engine is expected to be available later this year.

German equities closed higher on Tuesday, lifting European markets in general after the parliament approved plans for a large spending surge, while investors awaited details from a call between US and Russian leaders with a potential Ukraine peace deal on the line. The blue-chip index closed up 1 per cent after hitting an intraday record high. The domestically-exposed small-cap index climbed 3 per cent to a more than three-year high, while mid-caps were up 1.6 per cent. Germany’s Bundestag approved the reforms that include a major rollback of the so-called debt brake to increase defence spending, and a €500 billion fund for infrastructure. They will be presented to the upper house on Friday. The optimism around the reforms has resulted in a rally in defence stocks, the euro and euro zone yields in recent weeks, although they all pared gains after the vote. “It’s probably been a case of buy the rumour and sell the facts, where the German market has done so much better than everything else. There’s a little bit of profit taking,” said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter. Dublin Ires Reit fell 0.9 per cent after the State’s largest private residential landlord said it had refinanced its existing €500 million revolving credit facility in a deal that will leave its annual interest rate at 3.8 per cent, unchanged from 2024. AIB and Bank of Ireland trended up – by 1.4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively – along with many of Europe’s financials. Glanbia in contrast was down again, closing the session at €10.40. The Kilkenny-based food giant, which has a large US operation, has been struggling since an earnings downgrade last month. Home builder Glenveagh was up again – rising by 1.6 per cent – following on from last week’s positive results. Europe The pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.6 per cent with European banks leading gains, up 2.5 per cent. The banks index touched its highest level since February 2011, on higher spending prospects. Energy and automobile and parts shares followed, with most sectors ending the day in the green, as the European benchmark index outperformed Wall Street. Investors also awaited details from a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as the U.S. attempts to convince Moscow to accept a ceasefire in its war with Ukraine. Computacenter jumped 11 per cent after the technology and services provider said it was well placed for progress in 2025, with a strong order backlog across all regions. Bollore lost 5.4 per cent after the French conglomerate reported full-year results. Siemens gained 1.2 per cent after the engineering company said it would cut 5,600 jobs from its flagship digital industries business. London The FTSE 100 rose on Tuesday while US stocks slipped, as markets looked ahead to interest rate calls from both countries’ central banks later in the week. The Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve are poised to announce their latest decisions on interest rates, with traders expecting both to hold rates at their current levels. In the UK, policymakers have been gradually cutting borrowing costs since August last year, easing pressure on some borrowers who have seen lower mortgage rates enter the market. But the bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has stressed a “gradual and careful approach” to reducing rates. London’s blue-chip index rose 25 points to finish the day at 8,705, a 0.3 per cent rise. In company news, Close Brothers said it swung to a loss after setting aside £165 million (€196 million) in provisions for the motor finance commission scandal. Shares in the company slumped by 21.8 per cent after it posted a statutory pretax loss of £103.8 million for the six months to January 31, against profits of £87 million a year ago. New York Wall Street’s main indexes were lower on Tuesday on worries about the economic impact of US tariff policies ahead of a monetary policy decision from the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s two-day rate-setting meeting kicks off on Tuesday, and expectations are that the central bank will keep interest rates steady, according to data compiled by LSEG. Several US central bank officials have cautioned against hasty moves and said they would wait for data to see the impact of tariffs before making any policy shifts. “I don’t think they (Fed) know exactly how this (trade policy) is going to play out,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. Markets were taking a pause after all three major indexes gained more than 2 per cent each over the past two sessions as investors capitalised on discounted US equities following last week’s sell-off. The S&P 500 had tumbled more than 10 per cent from its February peak, signsignalling benchmark index entered a correction phase. The blue-chip Dow is trading close to correction levels, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq confirmed it is in a correction on March 6th. In company news, Alphabet fell 3 per cent after the company said it would buy Wiz for about $32 billion (€29 billion) in its biggest deal as the Google parent doubles down on cybersecurity. Nvidia declined 2.3 per cent. The company is expected to reveal details of its latest AI chip at its annual software developer conference. Tesla fell 4.2 per cent after brokerage RBC trimmed its price target on the EV maker’s stock, flagging the company is losing market share in China and Europe. Other megacaps slid, with Amazon losing 1.8 per cent and Meta down 4.3 per cent. – Additional reporting by Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Investors have met Google's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security startup Wiz with a collective yawn. Shares of parent-company Alphabet dropped as much as 5% on Tuesday following the deal announcement. The deal is seen as an attempt by Google to close the gap between itself and mega-cap cloud competitors like Amazon and Microsoft. But rather than react to a potentially transformative deal, investors elected to focus on economic-slowdown fears. These concerns stem largely from President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war, with uncertainty around tariffs clouding forecasts for corporate activity and economic expansion. Rumblings of a possible recession have gotten louder, leading to risk-off sentiment that recently pushed the benchmark S&P 500 into correction territory. Alphabet's share decline comes alongside a sell-off for the so-called Magnificent Seven. Tesla fell 5% to pace the group's losses, while Meta fell 4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1.8%. Investors will be watching the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting to determine how the central bank feels about the state of the economy. Virtually no investors expect an interest-rate cut at this meeting, though this could become a possibility down the road if the economic stimulus is needed. Jump to

March 18, 2025 14:17 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today unveiled NVIDIA Dynamo, an open-source inference software for accelerating and scaling AI reasoning models in AI factories at the lowest cost and with the highest efficiency. Efficiently orchestrating and coordinating AI inference requests across a large fleet of GPUs is crucial to ensuring that AI factories run at the lowest possible cost to maximize token revenue generation. As AI reasoning goes mainstream, every AI model will generate tens of thousands of tokens used to “think” with every prompt. Increasing inference performance while continually lowering the cost of inference accelerates growth and boosts revenue opportunities for service providers. NVIDIA Dynamo, the successor to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™, is new AI inference-serving software designed to maximize token revenue generation for AI factories deploying reasoning AI models. It orchestrates and accelerates inference communication across thousands of GPUs, and uses disaggregated serving to separate the processing and generation phases of large language models (LLMs) on different GPUs. This allows each phase to be optimized independently for its specific needs and ensures maximum GPU resource utilization. “Industries around the world are training AI models to think and learn in different ways, making them more sophisticated over time,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “To enable a future of custom reasoning AI, NVIDIA Dynamo helps serve these models at scale, driving cost savings and efficiencies across AI factories.” Using the same number of GPUs, Dynamo doubles the performance and revenue of AI factories serving Llama models on today’s NVIDIA Hopper™ platform. When running the DeepSeek-R1 model on a large cluster of GB200 NVL72 racks, NVIDIA Dynamo’s intelligent inference optimizations also boost the number of tokens generated by over 30x per GPU. To achieve these inference performance improvements, NVIDIA Dynamo incorporates features that enable it to increase throughput and reduce costs. It can dynamically add, remove and reallocate GPUs in response to fluctuating request volumes and types, as well as pinpoint specific GPUs in large clusters that can minimize response computations and route queries. It can also offload inference data to more affordable memory and storage devices and quickly retrieve them when needed, minimizing inference costs. NVIDIA Dynamo is fully open source and supports PyTorch, SGLang, NVIDIA TensorRT™-LLM and vLLM to allow enterprises, startups and researchers to develop and optimize ways to serve AI models across disaggregated inference. It will enable users to accelerate the adoption of AI inference, including at AWS, Cohere, CoreWeave, Dell, Fireworks, Google Cloud, Lambda, Meta, Microsoft Azure, Nebius, NetApp, OCI, Perplexity, Together AI and VAST. Inference Supercharged NVIDIA Dynamo maps the knowledge that inference systems hold in memory from serving prior requests — known as KV cache — across potentially thousands of GPUs. It then routes new inference requests to the GPUs that have the best knowledge match, avoiding costly recomputations and freeing up GPUs to respond to new incoming requests. “To handle hundreds of millions of requests monthly, we rely on NVIDIA GPUs and inference software to deliver the performance, reliability and scale our business and users demand,” said Denis Yarats, chief technology officer of Perplexity AI. “We look forward to leveraging Dynamo, with its enhanced distributed serving capabilities, to drive even more inference-serving efficiencies and meet the compute demands of new AI reasoning models.” Agentic AI AI provider Cohere is planning to power agentic AI capabilities in its Command series of models using NVIDIA Dynamo. “Scaling advanced AI models requires sophisticated multi-GPU scheduling, seamless coordination and low-latency communication libraries that transfer reasoning contexts seamlessly across memory and storage,” said Saurabh Baji, senior vice president of engineering at Cohere. “We expect NVIDIA Dynamo will help us deliver a premier user experience to our enterprise customers.” Disaggregated ServingThe NVIDIA Dynamo inference platform also supports disaggregated serving, which assigns the different computational phases of LLMs — including building an understanding of the user query and then generating the best response — to different GPUs. This approach is ideal for reasoning models like the new NVIDIA Llama Nemotron model family, which uses advanced inference techniques for improved contextual understanding and response generation. Disaggregated serving allows each phase to be fine-tuned and resourced independently, improving throughput and delivering faster responses to users. Together AI, the AI Acceleration Cloud, is looking to integrate its proprietary Together Inference Engine with NVIDIA Dynamo to enable seamless scaling of inference workloads across GPU nodes. This also lets Together AI dynamically address traffic bottlenecks at various stages of the model pipeline. “Scaling reasoning models cost effectively requires new advanced inference techniques, including disaggregated serving and context-aware routing,” said Ce Zhang, chief technology officer of Together AI. “Together AI provides industry-leading performance using our proprietary inference engine. The openness and modularity of NVIDIA Dynamo will allow us to seamlessly plug its components into our engine to serve more requests while optimizing resource utilization — maximizing our accelerated computing investment. We’re excited to leverage the platform’s breakthrough capabilities to cost-effectively bring open-source reasoning models to our users.” NVIDIA Dynamo Unpacked NVIDIA Dynamo includes four key innovations that reduce inference serving costs and improve user experience: NVIDIA Dynamo will be made available in NVIDIA NIM™ microservices and supported in a future release by the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform with production-grade security, support and stability.

March 18, 2025 13:47 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today unveiled partnerships with industry leaders T-Mobile, MITRE, Cisco, ODC, a portfolio company of Cerberus Capital Management, and Booz Allen Hamilton on the research and development of AI-native wireless network hardware, software and architecture for 6G. Next-generation wireless networks must be fundamentally integrated with AI to seamlessly connect hundreds of billions of phones, sensors, cameras, robots and autonomous vehicles. AI-native wireless networks will provide enhanced services for billions of users and set new standards in spectral efficiency — the rate at which data can be transmitted over a given bandwidth. They will also offer groundbreaking performance and resource utilization while creating new revenue streams for telecommunications companies. “Next-generation wireless networks will be revolutionary, and we have an unprecedented opportunity to ensure AI is woven in from the start,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Working with leaders in the field, we’re building an AI-enhanced 6G network that achieves extreme spectral efficiency.” Open Ecosystems Drive Innovation Research-driven breakthroughs harnessing the power of AI are necessary to maximize the performance and benefits of AI-native wireless networks. To drive innovation, NVIDIA is collaborating with telco and research leaders to develop an AI-native wireless network stack based on the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform, which provides software-defined radio access networks (RANs) on the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. Developers across the globe are building AI-RAN as a precursor to AI-native 6G wireless networks. AI-RAN is a technology that brings AI and RAN workloads together on one platform and embeds AI into radio signal processing. To deliver enhanced spectral efficiency and lower operational complexity and costs, AI will be fully embedded into the network stack’s software and hosted over a unified accelerated infrastructure, capable of running both network and AI workloads. Also at the solution’s core will be end-to-end security and an open architecture to foster rapid innovation. T-Mobile and NVIDIA will expand their AI-RAN Innovation Center collaboration announced last year with the goal of providing additional research-based concepts for AI-native 6G network capabilities, working alongside these new industry collaborators. “This is an exciting next step to the AI-RAN Innovation Center efforts we began last September at our Capital Markets Day in partnership with NVIDIA,” Mike Sievert, CEO of T-Mobile. “Working with these additional industry leaders on research to natively integrate AI into the network as we begin the journey to 6G will enable the network performance, efficiency and scale to power the next generation of experiences that customers and businesses expect.” As the founding research partner, MITRE, a not-for-profit research and development organization, will research, prototype and contribute open, AI-driven services and applications, such as for agentic network orchestration and security, dynamic spectrum sharing and 6G-integrated sensing and communications. “MITRE is working with NVIDIA to help make AI-native 6G a reality,” said Mark Peters, president and CEO of MITRE. “By integrating AI into 6G in the beginning, we can solve a wide range of problems, from enhancing service delivery to unlocking required spectrum availability to fuel wireless growth. Through all of our collaborations with NVIDIA, we look forward to creating impact in 6G, AI, simulation, transportation and more.” Cisco plans to take a lead position in this collaboration as the provider of mobile core and network technologies and will tap into its existing service provider reach and expertise. “With 6G on the horizon, it’s critical for the industry to work together to build AI-native networks for the future,” said Chuck Robbins, chair and CEO of Cisco. “Cisco is at the forefront of developing secure infrastructure technology for AI, and we are proud to work with NVIDIA and the broader ecosystem to create an AI-enhanced network that improves performance, reliability and security for our customers.” ODC, a portfolio company of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., will deliver cutting-edge layer 2 and layer 3 software for distributed and centralized units of virtual RAN as part of the AI-native radio access stack. Tapping into decades of experience in large-scale mobile systems, ODC is pioneering next-generation AI-native 5G open RAN (ORAN), surpassing existing networks and seamlessly paving the way for 6G evolution. “The mobile industry has always taken advantage of advances in other technology fields, and today, no technology is more central than AI,” said Shaygan Kheradpir, chairman of the advisory board of ODC. “ODC is at the forefront of developing and deploying AI-native ORAN 2.0 networks, enabling service providers to on-ramp seamlessly from 5G to 6G by taking advantage of the vast AI ecosystem to redefine the future of connectivity.” As a leader in AI and cybersecurity to the federal government, Booz Allen will develop AI RAN algorithms and secure the AI-native 6G wireless platform. Its NextG lab will conduct functional, performance integration and security testing to ensure the resiliency and security of the platform against the most sophisticated adversaries. The company will lead field trials for advanced use cases such as autonomy and robotics. “The future of wireless communications starts today, and it’s all about AI,” said Horacio Rozanski, chairman and CEO of Booz Allen. “Booz Allen has the technologies to make AI-native 6G networks a reality and revolutionize secure communications for an entirely new generation of intelligent platforms and applications.” Expanded Aerial Research PortfolioThese collaborations build on NVIDIA’s AI-RAN and 6G research ecosystem, supported by advancements in the NVIDIA Aerial™ research portfolio for developing, training, simulating and deploying groundbreaking AI-native wireless innovations.

March 18, 2025 13:19 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=136582&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until March 25, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Update: March 18, 2:37 p.m. ET: Huang announced the Vera Rubin GPU, which has twice the performance of its Grace chips with more memory and bandwidth. Rubin is expected in the second half of next year. Huang said the following Rubin Ultra is slated for the second half of 2027. Update: March 18, 2:35 p.m. ET: Huang says Blackwell Ultra NVL72 is coming in the second half of the year. Earlier in his keynote, Huang said Blackwell is in full production. Blackwell Ultra has one-and-a-half times more memory and more bandwidth. Update: March 18, 2:16 p.m. ET: Huang announced Nvidia Dynamo — “essentially the operating system of an AI factory” — for the future of AI agents. All eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA-1.05%) chief executive Jensen Huang today as he shares more about the chipmaker’s next artificial intelligence chips. In February, Huang said he would discuss the chipmaker’s Blackwell Ultra AI chip, next-generation Vera Rubin platform, and plans for following products at the annual GPU Technology Conference, also known as the GTC. Huang said the company has “some really exciting things to share” at the developer conference about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The chipmaker introduced its highly anticipated Blackwell AI platform at last year’s GTC, which has “successfully ramped up” large-scale production, and made “billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Huang said on the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call. Analysts at Bank of America (BAC+0.06%) said in a note last week that they “expect Nvidia to present attractive albeit well-expected updates on Blackwell Ultra,” with a focus on inferencing for reasoning models, which major firms such as OpenAI and Google are racing to develop. The analysts are also anticipating more information on Nvidia’s next-generation networking technology, and what the chipmaker’s long-term opportunities are in autonomous cars, physical AI such as robotics, and quantum computing. Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said Nvidia is likely to talk more about its Project DIGITS personal AI supercomputer at the GTC, in comments shared with Quartz. “I’ve been saying for years that Nvidia GPU systems are ‘like the iPhone cycle, but better,’” Cook said. “What I mean is that enterprises will pay for the latest, better, and faster from Jensen, but they can still use their old hardware, too, because it’s all integrated and updated by CUDA software.” Cook said he thinks DIGITS will give smaller developers the ability to build their own physical AI models and agentic AI applications. Follow along for live updates as Huang’s keynote begins at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) and runs for approximately two hours.

Title: The Wiretap: CISA Staff Are Cautiously Optimistic About Trump’s Pick For Director

ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster , Forbes Staff. The Wiretap is your weekly digest of cybersecurity, internet privacy and surveillance news. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images) President Trump has chosen the new head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Sean Plankey will take the helm, having previously served in the last Trump administration as director of cyber policy at the National Security Council, security positions at the Energy Department and Cyber Command and chief information officer for the Navy. Three employees inside the agency told Forbes they were cautiously optimistic about the new CISA director, who will be looking to steady a ship rocked by swift layoffs that hit a number of key projects, from securing elections to protecting AI systems from cyberattack. Over recent weeks, CISA employees, all speaking on the condition of anonymity, had told Forbes morale was low and concerns were high that important work was being hampered by the cuts. Two staffers and a recently-departed employee pointed to the Secure By Design initiative, which had major tech companies like Amazon and Google agree to implement procedures to ensure security in their products before they’re released to the public. While it remains active, a number of those who led the project have departed, leading to concerns that it is now understaffed, two insiders said. AI and open source security work has also been hit, as Wired recently reported. Plankey will be replacing the interim chief Bridget Bean over the coming weeks, should he pass through Senate confirmation, and two staffers said they’re happy someone with a long history in security is taking over. That Plankey is largely “non-controversial” and has worked across both the Pentagon and DHS should stand him in good stead, said one staffer. “I think most people are optimistic that we got a serious person with experience,” they added. The new director has yet to meet CISA staff. For now, one staffer said programs are getting ready to pitch themselves to Plankey to make sure they survive an “impending reorganization.” Many remain unsure how severe the downsizing will be, another said, only that it is coming this year. Meanwhile, after a restraining order was put on the Trump administration’s firings, CISA is having to re-hire any probationary staff laid off after January 20.

Mamadi Doumbouya for Forbes In some astonishing allegations filed in a northern California court this week, workforce management provider Rippling accused rival Deel of a corporate espionage campaign. The former alleged that the latter co-opted a Rippling employee to spy on its comms channels to look out for signs of customers switching away from Deel. The suit claims that Rippling set a trap to catch the rogue employee, saying it sent a letter detailing a Slack channel of interest to specific Deel execs. Within hours the suspected insider was searching for the make-believe channel. Deel has denied all wrongdoing. Apple has challenged a U.K. order that it open up a backdoor into users’ encrypted iCloud backups, but had to do so in a closed-door meeting at the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal. American lawmakers have raised concerns about the secretive, privacy-invading move. A sonic weapon was allegedly used against Serbian protesters over the weekend, as footage showed crowds fleeing what sounded like a low-flying jet. The government has denied any such anti-protest weaponry was deployed. Such tools have been used to deter demonstrations for years and the best known devices are the Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRADs), which are manufactured by Genasys. From March 28, Amazon is taking away Alexa users’ ability to prevent voice recordings being sent off to the tech giant’s servers. The reason? It needs to train its Alexa AI, reports Ars Technica. Google announced the acquisition of cloud cybersecurity provider Wiz in a $32 billion deal. A previous attempt to buy the company at $23 billion faltered last year. It’s Google’s biggest acquisition ever by quite a lot– the second largest was its purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion in 2011. Rostislav Panev, a 51-year-old Russian and Israeli dual national, has been extradited from Israel to the U.S. to face charges he helped develop the LockBit ransomware. Per a Department of Justice release, “Panev and his LockBit coconspirators grew LockBit into what was, at times, the most active and destructive ransomware group in the world. The LockBit group attacked more than 2,500 victims in at least 120 countries around the world, including 1,800 in the United States.”

March 18, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, March 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming April 14, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Merck & Co (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022, to February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR MERCK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2024, Merck released its second quarter 2024 financial report and disclosed a significant reduction in Gardasil vaccinations, resulting in an overabundance of inventory at Merck’s Chinese distributor. The Company announced that its shipments of Gardasil to China may fall below contracted levels for 2024. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $12.53, or 9.8%, to close at $115.25 per share on July 30, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 4, 2025, Merck disclosed that it would entirely cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory,” citing a continued over-inflation of channel inventories as demand in China had “not recovered to the level [the Company] had expected.” Merck also announced that it would no longer achieve its long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030. On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Merck securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than April 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Streaming Viewers Are Willing to Accept Ads, But Not If They're Paying for it, Tubi Finds

Time Published: 2025-03-18T13:53:43Z

As more and more streamers pile into advertising-led subscription services there are signs of a potential backlash among consumers with nearly 80% agreeing that if they’re paying for a streaming service, they expect no ads at all. That’s according to a new survey by Tubi, which also found that nearly half of Gen Z viewers found ads that seem misaligned with their own preferences to “significantly disrupt” their enjoyment of the streaming experience. Worth noting upfront that Tubi’s research, conducted as it is with The Harris Poll, is self-serving. The Fox-owned streamer, which claims more than 97 million monthly active users mostly in the U.S, is a largely free ad supported service. Nonetheless, the warning is there for streamers like Netflix or Amazon Prime as they ramp up ads and charge $6.99 and $8.99 a month for the basic with-ads service respectively. For instance, 81% of consumers told Tubi that watching ads is a fair trade-off for access to free streaming content and encouragingly for ad buyers 59% of viewers say they'd consider taking action after seeing interesting ads while streaming. This figure leaps up to 81% among Gen Z but there’s a catch: most ads miss the mark. 73% of Gen Z viewers though the ads they see when streaming “seem misaligned with my personal preferences.? This highlights a major missed opportunity for brands to create more relevant, impactful advertising. “Overwhelmingly, consumers see paid platforms with ads as a bad deal,” the report states. “Let’s face it, ads can feel disruptive, but they’ll be a more welcome interruption if they are relevant to the viewer and serve as a fair trade-off for free content.” The survey also reinforced the budget concerns of a subscription saturated target audience. Streaming is a sizable chunk of consumers' monthly entertainment budget – On average, consumers are spending $129 per month on streaming + cable which is $20 more than they spend on clothes each month $109. 56% of consumers say they monitor streaming services carefully, so as to not overspend, and Gen Z viewers are particularly cost-sensitive: 76% say they have or would end their streaming subscription over increased price. On average, viewers are juggling nearly 7 streaming services, with a mix of paid streaming services (3.9 on average) and free services (2.6 on average). Other frustrations that cause subscription switch-offs: removal of content (66% agree), irrelevant content (63% agree), tiered memberships (63% agree) and password crackdowns (45%, up 5% YoY). Two-thirds (67%) of Gen Z watchers have ended a streaming subscription because they finished watching the show or movie they were interested in – and there was no other relevant programming on the platform for them. A significant portion of Gen Z are looking to downsize their streaming use: 29% say they use more services now than they plan to in the future. It also found that password sharing is becoming a tricky social dilemma. Seven in 10 viewers told the survey that they wouldn't share their streaming login with a romantic partner unless they were seriously dating. “Why? Because like a toothbrush, once it's shared, there's no going back,” the report states. 44% of Gen Z admit that they've continued using an ex's streaming platform login even after they broke up. The unspoken rules of password sharing haven't got easier. More than half (53%) of Gen Z viewers think that password sharing has made relationships with family & friends more complicated, and 38% confess that they've stopped dating someone because their taste in TV / movies was so different. Tubi's conclusion: “Perhaps the era of the password pass around is over with viewers opting to keep their streaming relationships strictly professional.” In terms of content, Tubi found viewers favoring indies over remakes. 70% of US streamers want to see more TV shows & movies on platforms that are independent or from smaller creators (a 4% increase YoY). 73% of Gen Z says they prefer to watch original content over franchises/remakes; and 72% of Gen Z streamers wish they had more of a say in the type of content that gets made for streaming services. Tubi, the free streaming service owned by Fox, flew under the radar for years, but now the industry has taken note of its surging popularity. At NAB New York, Peter Kafka, Business Insider's chief correspondent about the TV/streaming landscape, talked with Tubi CEO Anjali Sud about the TV/streaming landscape and how her company is changing the ways that people watch. In the pursuit of catalyzing profit, large video streaming companies have been radically altering their approach to growing top-line revenue and curtailing costs for some time now, be it through layoffs, password-sharing crackdowns, licensing of catalog content to rival streamers, and, notably, the introduction of advertising tiers.

Title: Amazon Layoffs: AI likely to claim 14,000 corporate jobs by early this year as firm eyes cost cuts

Amazon Layoffs: E-commerce major Amazon Inc. is set to lay off 14,000 managerial jobs by early 2025 as the trillion-dollar company aims to cut costs. While this may not be a fresh round of firing, it may be recalled that back in September 2024 Amazon's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andy Jassy announced his plans to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15 per cent by the end of March 2025. A message from CEO Andy Jassy to the employees dated 16 September 2024 noted that he feels that the company can have a better organizational structure to drive the level of ownership and speed it desires. "We want more of our teammates feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time," Andy said. LiveMint has reached out to Amazon for an official comment to get an update on any recent changes to this decision. "We’re asking each s-team (senior-team) organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day," he added. Speaking on the issue of improving efficiency, Andy batted for returning to work from office. "To address the second issue of being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business, we’ve decided that we’re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID. When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," the CEO's message read, adding that “having the right culture at Amazon is something I don’t take for granted.” Reportedly, the company seeks to save between ₹210 crore and ₹360 crore annually after the said workforce reduction. These managerial job cuts will bring down the number of managers in the firm to 91,936 managers, compared to the current level of 1,05,770 managers. As of 2024, 15.5 lakh employees work at Amazon, compared to its previous levels of nearly 15.3 lakh employees, according to Business Insider.

The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models. That's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia. Huang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it. Here's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background. Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington. His uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University. Huang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland. Before founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985. At a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation. In 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU. Today, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models. Interest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights. In one notable milestone, Nvidia's market cap passed $3 trillion in 2024 to briefly overtake Apple as the world's most valuable company. Huang's net worth is $105.4 billion, according to Forbes. Huang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day. Current and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes. Huang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays. He has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share. Huang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product. Nvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang. Priem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia. After Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023. Huang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company. Huang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins. He has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Huang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award. In past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people. As of March 2024, Huang owned roughly 3.79% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder. Jump to

SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

March 17, 2025 18:49 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, March 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. AppLovin Corporation engages in building a software-based platform for advertisers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their content in the United States and internationally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that AppLovin (APP) Misled Investors Regarding its Profitability According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The complaint alleges that while defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors, they were concealing material adverse facts related to AppLovin’s manipulative practices to force unwanted apps on customers using a “backdoor installation scheme,” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn its profitability. Plaintiff alleges that the truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. On this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Liquid Mercury, a renowned provider of professional crypto trading and digital asset marketplaces, has announced a strategic partnership with dVIN Labs to launch an investment-grade wine trading platform collaboratively. The partnership will see Liquid Mercury provide a mechanism capable of powering the global order book for trading tokenized wine on the dVIN Protocol. With its design, the dVIN protocol seeks to leverage a combination of data, DePIN, DeFi, and tokenization to bring wine on-chain. Notably, dVIN’s mission to revolutionize the wine industry with blockchain-powered transparency and unified liquidity aligns greatly with Liquid Mercury’s decision to debut wine as an investment and tradable asset to millions of new investors. dVIN is a great fit for this partnership because it can solve the authenticity, verification, and provenance challenges that have relegated wine investment to an inefficient, niche activity that appeals to the well-connected uber-wealthy. David Garrett, co-founder and co-CEO of dVIN, commented on the partnership, saying, “The $300 billion investment-grade wine market is ready to be exposed to new investors and to become a liquid, tradable asset.” “Our goal is to make investing in wine as easy and efficient as investing in your favorite stock, cryptocurrency, or other favorite asset. We chose Liquid Mercury as our partner to create a liquid, global marketplace because our expertise in the wine market is matched by their team’s expertise in financial markets, laying the groundwork to unlock this exciting new digital asset class,” he added. The partnership will see Liquid Mercury, and dVIN join efforts to release a platform that will unify previously fragmented liquidity and turn investment-grade wine into a scalable asset class with democratized tools and access for retail investors and institutions alike. Furthermore, Liquid Mercury will provide white-labeled platforms for dVIN channel partners to onboard individual investors. These investors can gain instant access to wine from their favorite winemakers and exclusive wines held at bonded warehouses around the world. Also, Liquid Mercury will provide support for the dVIN global order book, which aggregates regional marketplaces and utilizes trading technology purpose-built to get the best price for buyers and sellers. Liquid Mercury CEO Tony Saliba also commented on the development saying; “Liquid Mercury is thrilled to partner with dVIN to unlock wine as an investment and tradable asset to millions of new investors…Our thesis for real-world assets has been that investing in culture is a powerful secular trend, and we know our battle-tested technology can reliably power new digital marketplaces, so we see massive potential in this partnership.”

Title: How Trump and Musk built their own reality

See our ethics statement. The presidents of the United States have gotten lost in the illusions they created. by Elizabeth Lopatto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The putative president of the United States, Donald Trump, stood on the White House lawn. In his hand, he held a sales pitch for Tesla cars. The most powerful man in America, Elon Musk, attired for a very casual funeral and looking miserable, stood next to Trump. As Trump spoke, promising to buy a Tesla, Musk stood with his arms folded over his chest, giving the undeniable impression of a sulking toddler. Later, Trump threatened to label anyone vandalizing Teslas or Tesla dealerships domestic terrorists. The entire incident was, in its way, revelatory. A series of protests had targeted Tesla dealerships and owners, as Americans expressed their distaste for Musk, the unelected leader of the US. The instinct, in response to real behavior, was to create a media moment: a Tesla ad. One of the bizarre hallmarks of the Trump era is a set of elected officials who increasingly cannot tell apart spectacle and reality — as well as a group of voters who seem similarly confused. Take the Trump voter insisting that government agencies get tax cuts for DEI initiatives, as a baffled Sam Seder attempts to explain that, in fact, government agencies are what taxes are for, and thus are not taxed themselves. It seems the conservative mind cannot comprehend that DEI is, in fact, actually popular. To avoid acknowledging that, the voter summoned up a conspiracy theory that flies in the basic facts of governance, which he either does not know or does not care about. Confronted with a choice between a truth he doesn’t like and a fantasy, he has chosen the fantasy. The break with reality has been a long time coming — QAnon and Pizzagate preceded it — but in the pre-pandemic era, it was largely the fringes of the conservative movement. Now it is the main event. Faced with the horrors of mass death in 2020, a great many people have since apparently chosen to make a break with reality. That is now the basis of the conservative movement, as Mark Zuckerberg tacitly acknowledged when he abandoned fact-checking on Meta platforms. Requiring Trump supporters to stick to truth on social media would mean they could not post. And what has replaced truth? Spectacle. The proclivity for spectacle is the thing Musk and Trump truly have in common, though the media they target is different: Musk is an online guy, and Trump was forged in reality TV. Trump’s media instincts hew closer to professional wrestling — he has hosted two WrestleManias — and he appears to approach his cabinet as a kind of casting for Fox News. Is noted drunkard Pete Hegseth good at his job? Who cares, he looks good on television. Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, originated on The Real World, after all. Musk has similarly created an online profile of himself, largely as a marketing gimmick for Tesla. (Hey, did you hear that Robert Downey Jr modeled his portrayal of Tony Stark on Elon Musk?) In less dire times, he posted about mixing wine and Ambien as readily as he did about SpaceX missions — creating a fandom in the process. He is optimized for the attention economy; Musk may be outrageous, he may be insulting, he may be juvenile, but he is not boring. I am one of many journalists who had to follow his entire charade of taking Tesla private — which played out on Twitter, rather than in any boardroom. The spectacle works because pseudo-events are more exciting than reality; a normal budgetary meeting is a snooze, and normal diplomatic relations rely on closed doors, occurring out of sight of the average voter. Reality TV doesn’t work on this level — and keeping the viewers hooked is the main source of Trump’s and Musk’s respective power. The question is how long the spell will last. Is it possible for reality to be more interesting than the spectacle? Is there a point at which the horrors stop being entertainment? One of the basic problems of the modern world, and of mass media, is that most news events occur at a distance to a normal person and appear only through representation. The Tesla protests, for example, occur on TV or on TikTok for most people, side by side with fiction, and given equal epistemic weight. TV news itself allowed its seriousness to erode beginning in the 1970s, chasing ratings through entertainment. The main innovation of Fox News, besides its propagandistic tendencies, was Roger Ailes’ focus on making sure the channel was titillating rather than useful. (Ailes’ formula included a “leg cam” and plenty of blondes.) Fox News — the “news” part is best thought of as a dark joke — is a ratings bonanza because its primary focus is entertainment. The formula is adapted for television but is roughly the same as that detailed by David Foster Wallace’s 2005 profile of right-wing talk radio “Host”: keep the audience enraged, keep the audience engaged. This runs parallel to reality TV, which is not especially reality-based. Trump jumped to Fox News from The Apprentice and WWE with his instincts for keeping an audience fully formed. His first term was marked by a preoccupation with ratings — not approval, but television. Trump has long had a propensity to call into his favorite Fox News shows to ramble away — and his schedule during his first term was crammed full of “executive time,” which one might presume was his TV habit. “This is going to be great television.” This focus on TV hasn’t changed. Trump’s disastrous meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ended with Trump telling Zelenskyy, “This is going to be great television.” Great television, of course, is not the same as great statecraft, and as a result of the meeting, European leaders pledged support for Ukraine. Trump is obsessed with invading Canada, and it appears to be because he doesn’t like seeing a wayward line on a map. This saber-rattling has got our mild-mannered northern neighbors boycotting US products. The maker of Jack Daniel’s says that Canada pulling US alcohol from store shelves to express their displeasure is “worse than tariffs.” Previous US leaders — starting with President John F. Kennedy — have also skillfully commanded television as a medium to suit their political ends. But those leaders seemed aware of the distinction between television and reality. For Trump, reality is whatever he says it is, which is then broadcast by Fox News back to him to confirm its truth. In his last term, even as Trump himself was sickened by the novel coronavirus, he insisted the pandemic was no big deal. After being taken by helicopter to a hospital, he made a series of public appearances where he was obviously ill and pretending not to be. Almost 400,000 people died from covid that year, according to death certificate information compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This may be the only way of explaining the bizarre economic policy coming from the White House. I don’t think Trump understands money — he’s filed for bankruptcy six times, hardly the sign of a successful businessman. But thanks to The Apprentice, he knows how to play a successful businessman on TV — by appearing domineering and decisive. The economy, however, occurs in reality rather than on TV, and in just 20 days of Trump’s flailing, the stock market has gone from all-time highs to an atmosphere of pure fear. The tariff threats, which Trump thinks make him sound powerful, are part of the problem, alienating trading partners and jacking up the price of ordinary goods. So, too, are Musk’s random firings of government workers under the guise of “efficiency.” Federal spending cuts also threaten everyone from farmers to retirees. Four airlines have cut their forecasts because they fear consumer confidence is waning. Sure, some of the economy — the stock market in particular, about which, more in a minute — can be shaped by narrative. The problem is a conflict of interest: the things that Trump thinks make him look strong to his voters also make the business community skittish. Consider his tariffs. They target some of America’s biggest imports and stand to make it harder to get your car repaired, assuming you can buy one at all. If the stock market continues to plunge, it’ll hit baby boomers squarely in their retirement savings, which will mean less spending overall. So, Trump is destroying the economy so he can look and feel tough — the sign of a man who’s confused about the difference between television and reality. His main source of funding, Musk, who has signaled he wants to buy more influence, is similarly confused. Musk’s problem isn’t TV, though. It’s the internet. Musk spent the last 10 years or so as the internet’s premier financial influencer, memeing Tesla’s stock to a bizarrely high price-earnings ratio through his Twitter antics. (Indeed, the platform was so important to him that he eventually bought it.) And while he has enough sense of reality to ransack the federal government in order to benefit SpaceX, meet with foreign leaders, and cut oversight of his companies, he is also striking poses for the benefit of X. Take, for instance, telling the foreign minister of Poland, “Be quiet, small man” on X. Poland has been paying for Starlink terminals used in Ukraine and has threatened to find another provider. As Trump and Musk blunder around the EU, alienating allies in order to cozy up to Russia, Musk’s Twitter fingers escalate the sense of panic. Not exactly what you want when the EU is considering rearming itself. Musk’s power is very real. He has control of the US Treasury — because while the courts have repeatedly ruled against him, those court orders need to be enforced to matter, and on several occasions, Musk and his goons have reportedly “vetoed” payments Trump has ordered. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts happen at his whim. That means that Republican officials call Musk directly to grovel. But they also publicly perform for Musk on X. Take Ed Martin, the US attorney, who has promised an X account claiming to be DOGE-affiliated that he will take action on “doxing.” Or Oklahoma senator James Lankford publicly begging for his pet ammunition plant to be spared DOGE cuts. Even the mothers of Musk’s children resort to X performances to get his attention. Even the mothers of Musk’s children resort to X performances to contact him Rather than attempting to reassert their constitutional power and decapitate DOGE, Republicans have chosen to abase themselves. “What we got to do as Republicans is capture their work product, put it in a bill and vote on it,” said Lindsey Graham, the senator from North Carolina, according to CNN. He is the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, which, before Musk, was actually a fairly powerful position. Now it seems his job is to rubber-stamp Musk’s decisions. Musk’s key obsession appears to be “wokeness,” a smokescreen for dismantling the Civil Rights Movement. The weird conspiracy theories Musk is ingesting on X are guiding his cuts in the government, which have been haphazard and have, at times, resulted in the rehiring of fired employees after officials belatedly realized they were crucial. The cuts, which have not delivered Musk’s promised cost savings, have been justified through lies Musk and DOGE have promoted, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency housing migrants in luxury hotels. Musk is not so far gone that he can’t raid the government to suit himself. Appealing to the Trump base gives him cover to target agencies that will benefit him directly, such as NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Musk is effectively trying to create his own political reality, using X as a staging ground. The more noxious and viral the claims, the more useful they are to Musk. He is also attempting to destroy anything that might contract his constructed reality — which explains his war on Wikipedia. Wikipedia, a largely volunteer-run nonprofit, is a remarkably accurate encyclopedia — at least as accurate as the Encyclopedia Britannica, and maybe more so. It is a reference source available to anyone. And Musk loathes it. As long as it remains, anyone can check what he says and discover when he is wrong. He has hated that for a very long time. Despite Musk’s increasingly batshit public performance, which now includes a gesture that looks suspiciously like a Nazi salute, Republicans are too scared to criticize him. They know Musk can fund a primary challenge against them without breaking a sweat. So they’re stuck with Musk, who has been posting increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories to his X account. When X went down earlier this week, Musk claimed with no evidence that Ukraine was behind the company’s outage. Instead, hacking collective Dark Storm has taken credit for the disruption. Once upon a time, this all served a business purpose Musk has a long history of manipulating attention online — well before his chainsaw antics at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), his jumping jack at a Trump rally, or the alleged Sieg Heil. Twitter, when it was still called that, was how he created a fan base that hung on his every word. For at least the last decade, he’s been creating a reality-distortion field. Sometime around 2018 — I’d pinpoint it at his “pedo guy” defamation trial — Musk stopped being able to distinguish between his performances and reality. As this happened, the amount of time he spent posting on Twitter started to climb. Once upon a time, there was a business purpose: Twitter meant he didn’t have to do traditional advertising for Tesla; eventually, he built a profile big enough that he could just show up on TV shows like Saturday Night Live, while his competitors had to buy ads. But it seems Musk has become increasingly isolated, since his fame has made it difficult to appear in public. That means Twitter, now X, has been his main social outlet for some time, and it appears to have seriously warped him. At CPAC, when Musk, apparently zooted, mumbled something about “I am become meme,” he really, really meant it. It is, at times, difficult to know if Musk can distinguish fantasy from reality. Twitter is a far more poisoned well than cable news, and as Musk’s use has increased, his public statements have gotten increasingly weird. Musk has repeatedly suggested that Fort Knox’s gold is gone — never mind that in the last Trump administration, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited the gold. Is this just red meat to the base? Does Musk want an excuse to be let into Fort Knox, to visit or even pocket the gold? Or did he read something on the darker recesses of Twitter and take it as truth? Musk has also claimed that there is wild fraud in Social Security, targeting it for the latest round of DOGE cuts. Musk has said that Social Security is “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” which will doubtless be news to the many retirees who rely on it. Looks like Musk is attempting to create the conditions that would allow him to slash Social Security by inventing fraud wholesale. But it is possible, I suppose, that he is so brainrotted he really believes what he’s saying. The White House is currently claiming that Musk’s intent to meddle with Social Security won’t affect payments. We’ll see. The guy who’s posting memes calling people who receive it “the parasite class” doesn’t seem like he’s a careful steward of the program. And stiffing Social Security beneficiaries could add to Trump’s economic woes — as, once again, retirees cut spending. TV and X reproduce events that happen at a distance, which makes it easier for distortions to take hold. If someone tells me it is raining while I am standing in the sun, I know I am being lied to. But if someone tells me that the gold in Fort Knox has been stolen, I cannot check that directly. I have to trust intermediaries — the soldiers who guard the gold, the Treasury auditors who annually count it. As trust in institutions has been eroded, partly through the institutions’ own mistakes, conspiracy theories have run wild. Conspiracy theories are usually more entertaining than reality — a secret gold heist is so sensational that multiple movies have been made about it — but they also flatter the conspiracist, who now has secret knowledge. The flattering part, the secret knowledge, is what allows conspiracy theorists to continue to believe lies even in the face of actual, verifiable events. I’m not convinced Trump and Musk are tracking reality anymore, in part because, in reality, they look pretty ugly. Better to imagine themselves as their fans do: bold heroes, fighting for America — rather than gross authoritarians ransacking the country for personal benefit. As for their supporters, the erratic behavior, tariffs, abrupt firings, and tensions with Canada have some Michigan swing voters expressing reservations. These people are at least aware of economic reality. But right now, true believers in DOGE and Trump feel they are part of a community that is “saving” the US from, uhhhh, woke? Usually, lie-based belief systems are fragile — it’s hard to make the initial dent in the worldview, but once it happens, the whole thing shatters. The attacks on Tesla threaten Trump and Musk, and might be enough to shake some of their followers loose. They are also, and this is important, entertaining in a way that works against the pair. It is funny to listen to Cybertruck owners whine. It is even funnier to see the Cybertruck get stuck or have parts fall off. Tesla’s plunging stock price threatens Musk’s reputation and spending power Tesla’s plunging stock price threatens Musk’s business reputation — particularly since he’s supposedly the company’s CEO and yet is spending all of his time in the White House, securing fun new payouts for SpaceX. It also threatens his spending power, since most of Musk’s net worth is tied up in Tesla stock. Worse, a lot of that stock is pledged as collateral for loans. As of a 2024 SEC filing, about a third of Musk’s Tesla shares were pledged. If Tesla’s share price falls low enough, Musk has to pony up more shares or pay back some of his loans, which leaves him with less spending money for Trump and the Republicans. That loosens some of his grip on power. No wonder he’s panicking. The little demonstration on the White House lawn shows how much power Musk still has over Trump — because if Trump wanted to apply pressure to Musk, he wouldn’t make a public show of support. You can see, if you squint, what’s happening. Trump and Musk are trying to reframe the protest against Tesla dealerships (and indeed, Teslas themselves) as the “woke mob” — substituting into the roles that “antifa” and “Black Lives Matter” played in Trump’s last presidency. Footage of people protesting Tesla and leaving bags of dog shit on Cybertrucks can create a new enemy for Musk and Trump’s enemies to hate, letting them dodge anger for their actions that harm the economy and Social Security. The question is whether it’ll work. Cuts to Social Security and Medicaid have the potential to be dangerous to Musk — and therefore also to Trump. Both programs are popular, even with Republicans. Musk says he’s going to cut $700 billion, which may mean putting up new hurdles for people to receive their benefits — requiring more paperwork, say. Or it may mean cutting payments to doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes. Either way, it’ll hit people who rely on both programs pretty quickly, as they are increasingly unable to access care. And it’s hard to blame that on former President Joe Biden when Musk is out here already taking credit for it. If grandma suddenly can’t see her doctor, we all know who’s to blame — Elon Musk, and the guy who put him in office, Donald Trump. I’m not sure any amount of “woke mob” posturing can undo that.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Amazon plans to lay off 14,000 managerial positions to save $3.5B yearly
URL: https://techstartups.com/2025/03/17/amazon-to-lay-off-14000-managerial-positions-to-save-3-5-billion-annually/
Time Published: 2025-03-17T21:50:22Z
Full Content:
Amazon is set to cut around 14,000 managerial positions by early 2025, aiming to save between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion annually. This reduction marks a 13% drop in Amazon’s global management workforce, shrinking the number of managers from 105,770 to 91,936. This move follows recent layoffs in Amazon’s communications and sustainability units, as the company pushes to streamline operations and restructure teams. According to Business Insider, the job cut is part of CEO Andy Jassy’s strategy to simplify decision-making and speed up processes. Last month, Jassy announced plans to boost the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. He emphasized that reducing managerial layers would streamline operations and enable Amazon to make faster decisions without getting bogged down by bureaucracy. In a note released Thursday, Morgan Stanley projected that Amazon’s plan could cut around 13,834 managerial roles by early next year, saving the company between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion. The estimate is based on the assumption that managers make up 7% of Amazon’s workforce. “Morgan Stanley estimated that this effort could lead to the elimination of roughly 13,834 manager roles by early next year, resulting in cost savings of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion,” Business Insider reported. As part of this plan, Amazon has launched a “bureaucracy tipline,” encouraging employees to flag inefficient procedures that slow down work. Managers have also been instructed to increase their direct reports, limit senior hires, and review pay structures to support the shift toward a leaner management model. This layoff wave continues Amazon’s cost-cutting efforts that saw over 27,000 job cuts in 2022 and 2023. The company has also pulled back on projects that didn’t yield profits, including its “Try Before You Buy” clothing initiative and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery service. Amazon’s workforce saw significant growth during the pandemic, swelling to over 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in late 2019. Although numbers have dipped since then, the company is still recalibrating its staffing needs. Earlier this year, Amazon mandated that corporate employees return to the office five days a week. Some staff were asked to relocate to designated office hubs, prompting some to leave rather than move. Management restructuring is another key part of Jassy’s approach, with efforts to reduce layers between employees and leadership. This move places Amazon alongside other tech companies trimming their workforce. Layoffs.FYI, a site tracking job cuts in tech, reports that 81 tech companies have eliminated 22,692 jobs so far this year.

Title: Klarna, nearing IPO, plucks lucrative Walmart fintech partnership from rival Affirm
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/klarna-nearing-ipo-plucks-lucrative-walmart-fintech-partnership-rival-rcna196764
Time Published: 2025-03-17T18:44:39Z
Full Content:
Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Swedish fintech firm Klarna will be the exclusive provider of buy now, pay later loans for Walmart, taking a coveted partnership away from rival Affirm, CNBC has learned. Klarna, which just disclosed its intention to go public in the U.S., will provide loans to Walmart customers in stores and online through the retailer’s majority-owned fintech startup OnePay, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the partnership. OnePay, which updated its brand name from One this month, will handle the user experience via its app, while Klarna will make underwriting decisions for loans ranging from three months to 36 months in length, and with annual interest rates from 10% to 36%, said the people. The new product will be launched in the coming weeks and will be scaled to all Walmart channels by the holiday season, likely leaving it the retailer’s only buy now, pay later option by year-end. The move heightens the rivalry between Affirm and Klarna, two of the world’s biggest BNPL players, just as Klarna is set to go public. Although both companies claim to offer a better alternative for borrowers than credit cards, Affirm is more U.S.-centric and has been public since 2021, while Klarna’s network is more global. Shares of Affirm fell 13% in morning trading Monday. The deal comes at an opportune time for Klarna as it readies one of the year’s most highly anticipated initial public offerings. After a dearth of big tech listings in the U.S. since 2021, the Klarna IPO will be a key test for the industry. The firm’s private market valuation has been a roller coaster: It soared to $46 billion in 2021, then crashed by 85% the next year amid the broader decline of high-flying fintech firms. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has worked to improve Klarna’s prospects, including touting its use of generative artificial intelligence to slash expenses and headcount. The company returned to profitability in 2023, and its valuation is now roughly $15 billion, according to analysts, nearly matching the public market value of Affirm. The OnePay deal is a “game changer” for Klarna, Siemiatkowski said in a release confirming the pact. “Millions of people in the U.S. shop at Walmart every day — and now they can shop smarter with OnePay installment loans powered by Klarna,” he said. “We look forward to helping redefine checkout at the world’s largest retailer — both online and in stores.” As part of the deal, OnePay can take a position in Klarna. In its F-1 filing, Klarna said it entered into a “commercial agreement with a global partner” in which it is giving warrants to purchase more than 15 million shares for an average price of $34 each. OnePay is the partner, people with knowledge of the deal confirmed. For Affirm, the move is likely to be seen as a blow at a time when tech stocks are particularly vulnerable. Run by CEO Max Levchin, a PayPal co-founder, the company’s stock has surged and fallen since its 2021 IPO. The lender’s shares have dipped 18% this year before Monday. Affirm executives frequently mention their partnerships with big merchants as a key driver of purchase volumes and customer acquisition. In November, Affirm’s chief revenue officer, Wayne Pommen, referred to Walmart and other tie-ups including those with Amazon, Shopify and Target as its “crown jewel partnerships.” An Affirm spokesman had this statement: “We win business when merchants want superior performance and maximum value, given our underwriting and capital markets advantages. We will continue our long-term strategy of competing on our products and entering into sustainable partnerships.” The deal is no less consequential to Walmart’s OnePay, which has surged to a $2.5 billion pre-money valuation just two years after rolling out a suite of products to its customers. The startup now has more than 3 million active customers and is generating revenue at an annual run rate of more than $200 million. As part of its push to penetrate areas adjacent to its core business, Walmart executives have touted OnePay’s potential to become a one-stop shop for Americans underserved by traditional banks. Walmart is the world’s largest retailer and says it has 255 million weekly customers, giving the startup — which is a separate company backed by Walmart and Ribbit Capital — a key advantage in acquiring new customers. Last year, the Walmart-backed fintech began offering BNPL loans in the aisles and on checkout pages of Walmart, CNBC reported at the time. That led to speculation that it would ultimately displace Affirm, which had been the exclusive provider for BNPL loans for Walmart since 2019. OnePay’s move to partner with Klarna rather than going it alone shows the company saw an advantage in going with a seasoned, at-scale provider versus using its own solution. OnePay’s push into consumer lending is expected to accelerate its conversion of Walmart customers into fintech app users. Cash-strapped consumers are increasingly relying on loans to meet their needs, and the installment loan is seen as a wedge to also offer users the banking, savings and payments features that OnePay has already built. Americans held a record $1.21 trillion in credit card debt in the fourth quarter of last year, about $441 billion higher than balances in 2021, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data. “It’s never been more important to give consumers simple and convenient ways to access fair credit at the point of sale,” said OnePay CEO Omer Ismail. “That’s especially true for the millions of people who turn to Walmart every week for everything.” Next up is likely a OnePay-branded credit card offered with the help of a new banking partner after Walmart successfully exited its partnership with Capital One. “We’re looking forward to going down this new path where not only can they provide installment credit ... but also revolving credit,” Walmart CFO John David Rainey told investors in June. — CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos and Melissa Repko contributed to this report. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Title: The cost of GLP-1s needs to come way down for benefits to be worth it, study says
URL: https://qz.com/glp-1s-wegovy-zepbound-study-health-benefits-cost-1851770425
Time Published: 2025-03-17T17:21:54Z

While weight-loss drugs like Zepbound (LLY-0.16%) and Wegovy (NVO-2.35%) offer significant health benefits, their high costs make them economically inefficient under current U.S. healthcare standards, according to a new study published Friday in JAMA Health Forum. Researchers analyzed national survey data to assess the long-term impact of four anti-obesity medications, including tirzepatide and semaglutide — the active ingredients in Zepbound and Wegovy, respectively. They found that these drugs could help prevent obesity-related complications such as heart disease and diabetes. However, their high price tags — $12,648 per year for tirzepatide and $13,618 per year for semaglutide — exceed the typical cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 to $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). QALY is a standard benchmark in healthcare used to evaluate whether a medical treatment provides good value for its cost, essentially how much a healthcare system or insurance provider is generally willing to pay for each additional QALY or year of perfect health gained under a treatment. In the U.S., treatments are generally considered cost-effective if they fall below the $100,000–$150,000 per QALY range. To meet that threshold, the study found, tirzepatide’s price would need to drop by 30.5%, while semaglutide would require an 81.9% reduction. “Efforts to reduce the net prices of new anti-obesity medications are essential to ensure equitable access to highly effective anti-obesity medications,” the study authors wrote. The findings come as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) moves forward with efforts to lower drug costs. Earlier this year, CMS announced it had selected 15 additional drugs for its second round of price negotiations, including Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy. The new lower Medicare prices are set to take effect in 2027. For their part Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly — the maker of Zepbound — have both launched direct-to-consumer pharmacies that offer the drugs at lower prices for patients that pay without insurance.

Title: You can't split a payment on Airbnb directly — here's what you can do instead
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-split-payment-on-airbnb
Time Published: 2025-03-17T16:46:37Z
Full Content:
Up until 2018, Airbnb offered a feature that was a favorite among users: split rental fees. With a few extra clicks of your mouse or taps on your phone, you could invite everyone staying at a rental to pay their share of the fee and avoid those awkward conversations about who owed who how much cash or who already sent money through Venmo. However, you can no longer split payments on Airbnb. So, if you want to split the cost of an Airbnb rental, you have to do it the old-fashioned way — with a few exceptions. The simplest way to split the cost of an Airbnb is for one person to handle the entire payment via the Airbnb site or app and then have everyone else pay their fair share through Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, Apple Pay, or any other preferred payment app. Most rentals will also allow you to pay a down payment when booking and then pay the rest in installments, giving you time to collect payments from everyone else staying at the Airbnb. If you choose to pay in installments, you can use a different credit card for each payment, which may be a good option if there are just two of you splitting the bill. If you're renting a long-term Airbnb, you also have the option of using a different payment method for each recurring monthly charge. If you're the one to lay down your credit card, you can also collect a large number of points, especially if you use a travel credit card. Unfortunately, Airbnb doesn't make it easy to split payments for a reservation if you're traveling with a group. Your best option is for one person to pay and then use an electronic payment service like Venmo, PayPal, CashApp, or Apple Pay to collect reimbursements from the other travelers.

Title: Five reasons to expect a US equity recovery

Time Published: 2025-03-17T13:21:54Z

It appears US equities are getting caught up between Sino-US geopolitical tensions. Ironically, it is the under owned stocks in export sensitive economies, like China and the EU, that have prospered on expectations of greater fiscal spending brought about by Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda. On the US side, it seems that Trump’s trade protectionism agenda has backfired. The mighty US tech sector has seemingly lost its sheen, and the risk of a US recession has increased. The Atlanta Fed’s early read on real GDP for the first quarter of 2025 estimates a contraction of 2.4% at an annualised rate, the biggest decline since the pandemic-led lockdown. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Much of that decline comes from imports brought forward ahead of expected US tariff increases, which led to a large drag on GDP. It is not yet clear if this is just a temporary stalling in growth or something more significant. Final sales to domestic producers, a more specific measure of domestic private consumer demand that excludes exports, is still growing at a 0.8% rate, which is probably a better read of the health of the underlying economy. Trump may be placing greater importance on keeping the cost of government borrowing down at the expense of the equity market. That’s because Trump’s party, the Republicans, will be asking Congress over the coming months to raise the debt ceiling limit by over $4trn as part of a comprehensive legislative package to deliver on his domestic priorities. Trump will want to show that the US public debt market is stable ahead of a likely “Birthday Summit” with President Xi in June when both presidents celebrate their birthdays. Trump will want the Chinese to commit to buy more US Treasuries at that meeting. Furthermore, in an interview on Fox News on March 10, Trump appeared to talk down long-term interest rates by saying the US economy is experiencing a “period of transition”. That’s because he wants a weaker US dollar to support the competitiveness of US manufacturing. Indeed, Trump made this point in a speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4 when he said, “We need a weaker dollar to bring back our manufacturing jobs. A strong dollar makes it difficult for our companies to compete globally”. Trump is also using the war in Ukraine, and the threat of removing financial and military support, as leverage to get European nations to step-up fiscal spending on defence and ideally, US military hardware. Following the recent German election, there is a desire from the leadership of the new incoming government to raise fiscal spending by reforming the so-called “debt brake” – a mechanism to ensure budget deficits are kept down on a structural basis. This includes more German public expenditure on infrastructure and an open-ended commitment to raise defence procurement. Essentially, this expansionary fiscal policy could narrow the US-European growth gap and give impetus for the euro to appreciate against the dollar. On the China side, Beijing is using a subtle response to Trump’s trade tariffs. President Xi’s recent meeting with Jack Ma, the co-founder of tech giant Alibaba, was choreographed to show the Tech sector has implicit approval from the Chinese political leadership. In addition, the release of DeepSeek (an AI model by a Chinese startup) in January did not help the US tech sector either. DeepSeek raises questions on whether US companies should be spending so much money on computing hardware. China is using its “soft power” to weaken US dominance in financial markets and its economy down a notch to strengthen the country’s negotiation hand ahead of an inevitable President Trump-Xi summit to discuss trade and investment. Arguably, the key takeaway for investors from recent Sino-US geopolitical tensions is that the US dollar has depreciated. This adds support for US stocks in several ways. First, they become cheaper for non-US investors. Second, fundamentally, a weaker US dollar should boost US multinationals’ profits from overseas when translated back home. And third, dollar weakness indicates that there is a greater supply of the currency than demand. Potentially, this creates favourable financial conditions for equities to recover from oversold levels should money flows back to risky assets. The recent US equity price falls mean valuations for the so-called US ‘Magnificent Seven’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) look more favourable. For instance, their aggregate forward price-to-earnings ratio is at a 40% premium compared to the rest of the US S&P 500, its lowest level since 2018.[1] Nvidia is trading on a valuation of 24 times earnings, which looks relatively attractive considering its high profit margins and potential for rapid growth in expected sales over the coming years from AI demand. The US 30-year Treasury yield is currently at 4.6%, down 0.4% points from a peak in mid-January. Fundamentally, given US mortgage rates are priced-off the long-term cost of government borrowing, less money is being spent on making interest payments, potentially giving a boost to the housing market to drive economic growth. Lower Treasury yields also support stocks by making equity valuations look more attractive to government bonds. Although it is early days, the ructions seen in equities does not appear to have dampened consumer expenditure. That’s because with inflation slowing and jobs being created, annual real take-home pay grew nearly 2% in January. Moreover, deregulation and expected tax cuts should drive hiring. The National Federation of Independent Business survey (a barometer of small business sentiment) shows that hiring intentions are at their highest level in over a year. Importantly, this should give consumers the confidence to shop. Providing the US economy continues to grow at a relatively healthy clip, this increases the chances that companies can deliver on consensus earnings’ expectations. As it stands the consensus expects MSCI USA earnings-per-share (EPS) growth of 12.1% in 2025, a modest downgrade from 14.5% at the start of the year. However, in early January, EPS for 2026 has been revised up to 14.5% from 13.2%.[2] Overall, there has been little change in company earnings’ expectations when averaging out this year and next. To summarise, US equities have felt the brunt of uncertain China-US geopolitical tensions. On the upside, the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stock valuations have adjusted to more reasonable levels. The US dollar appears to have peaked to create favourable financial conditions for stocks. Moreover, the economic outlook remains encouraging, supported by consumption and the labour market, but with increased downside risks from policy uncertainty. Trump appears willing to tolerate volatile markets in the short term to achieve his longer-term goals of weakening the dollar and keeping the cost of government borrowing down to fund his domestic priorities. For that he will still need to find common ground with President Xi in the summer. Daniel Casalii is the Chief Investment Strategist at Evelyn Partners

Title: BI spoke with federal workers who voted for Trump — some have come to regret it

Good morning. The backlash Tesla owners are facing over Elon Musk has crossed the pond. Here in London, a man says he was aghast when he was confronted about his vehicle in a parking lot.In today's big story, BI spoke with 10 federal workers who voted for Trump. Months later, some of them now regret it. What's on deck Markets: Rob Arnott thinks the market's tech stock sell-off isn't over. Tech: BI reviewed a leaked ByteDance document showing TikTok staff being evaluated on their "ByteStyle" and more. Business: Needy hospitals are trapped in a cycle of corporate plunder, Bethany McLean writes. But first, some voters feel hoodwinked. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "I feel betrayed. This is not what I wanted, to let everybody lose their job." That's what a two-time Trump voter who works for Veterans Affairs told BI. "You're fired. You're fired. You're fired. This is not 'The Apprentice.'" So far, tens of thousands of workers have already lost their jobs as a result of DOGE's efforts to reshape the federal workforce. With Elon Musk as de facto leader, the DOGE office initiatives have ranged from dismantling agencies like USAID to slashing budgets and sweeping layoffs — some of which have been reversed by court order. Just a few months ago, some of the workers impacted by the cuts may have been celebrating Trump's election victory. They voted for a better economy, lower prices, or more stringent border controls. What they didn't expect was an existential threat to their careers. BI spoke to current and former federal workers who voted for Trump — and some have come to regret it. "If I knew I was going to lose my job because Trump became president, no, I would not vote for him," one worker said. Betrayal. Anger. Regret. You can read what all the workers told BI here. For federal workers hoping to now pivot to the private sector, things might be tricky. Lackluster corporate hiring, a shrinking middle-management job market, and pullbacks by universities are making the route to employment beyond federal agencies trickier to navigate, BI's Tim Paradis writes. Federal workers also face a unique hurdle. Recruiters and career coaches told BI that many federal workers have the know-how to succeed in private industry, yet they might struggle to make that clear. Adopting a key new skill might help them: translation. 1. Rob Arnott says the sell-off in tech stocks isn't over. "We're seeing the unwinding of a bubble," Arnott, the founder of Research Affiliates, told BI. He compared the current market to the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and warned that the Magnificent Seven stocks are set to slide further. 2. Why China looks investible again. Just a year ago, investors fled the country in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, with the CSI 300 dropping over 45%. Now, the country's stocks are rallying, thanks to a pro-tech shift from Beijing — and analysts are paying attention. 3. Follow these leaders for sharp insights on recessions. Leading economists are bracing for a recession, although there's been no official call yet. BI compiled a list of the best commentators on recessions, and the warning signs they're watching. 1. Amazon's DeepSeek scramble. When DeepSeek debuted in January, customer demand was so high Amazon rushed to add the AI to its development tool Bedrock. Now, Amazon wants to promote its products as an alternative to DeepSeek and is telling employees to point out its privacy and security issues, according to internal guidelines seen by BI. 2. Meet the Palantir Mafia. The software company's alumni have collectively raised more than $6 billion for their own startups, which include the social-gathering app Partiful and the defense-tech company Anduril. See BI's list of 30 Palantir alums who struck out on their own. 3. How TikTok scores employees. It's performance review season for TikTok employees, and BI viewed a rubric to see how they're scored. Workers are measured on Output, Leadership Principles, and ByteStyles — i.e. a set of workplace values. If an employee receives a low rating, though, they could end up on a PIP. 1. How wealthy investors keep bankrupting needy hospitals. As Steward Health Care closed hospitals and cut corners on care, its top officers got richer, and the profits kept flowing to its private-equity owner Cerberus. Now, its bankruptcy reveals a deeper flaw in America's healthcare infrastructure: Facilities that have been plundered can only be sold to others who are likely to continue the plundering, Bethany McLean writes. 2. Older Americans on the shifting job market. Some are taking blue- collar jobs, while others are navigating unemployment. Many told BI that ageism, technology changes, and economic shifts have affected their retirement plans. 3. The ghosted generation. College app rejections. No-show dates. Job apps sent into the void. No one has been more rejected in both their personal and professional lives than Gen Z, writes Delia Cai. It's led young people to adopt a blasé attitude in order to protect themselves — and it could turn them into a generation of incredibly risk-averse adults. It's St. Patrick's Day.

Title: The weight loss drug shortage is over — and some patients are 'panicking'

Time Published: 2025-03-17T09:00:00Z

For Maria Rising, managing her health felt like chasing a phantom. The 30-year-old Lansing, Mich. consultant has for years battled polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — a hormonal disorder that can cause weight fluctuations, insulin resistance, and in some cases debilitating pain. “It’s like hitting a moving target,” Rising said, describing the endless treatments that never quite worked. Then came a glimmer of hope: In January 2024, her gynecologist suggested Zepbound (LLY), one of the GLP-1 medications proving remarkably effective at treating a host of conditions, including managing PCOS symptoms. The drugs worked so well they’d become victims of their own success — Rising found herself at the back of a very long line. “I was calling pharmacies. I was calling all over the state. I was like, ‘I’ll drive and go get it if you have it.’ But nobody had it,” she said. When Rising couldn’t find Zepbound at any pharmacy, she explored alternatives, in consultation with her doctors, and eventually turned to compounded tirzepatide — an off-brand version of the active ingredient in Zepbound. Rising currently pays $287 a month for her compounded medication, a steep discount compared to the branded drug’s nearly $1,000 price tag. Since being on the drug, she has lost 40 pounds and other symptoms have eased. But that might all change very soon. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced the end of shortages that have plagued popular weight-loss drugs, like Zepbound and Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) Wegovy. With branded options now deemed “fully available,” the agency plans to crack down on compounded GLP-1 medications as soon as this month — a regulatory pivot that could reshape access for patients like Rising overnight. Soaring demand for weight-loss drugs has turned Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly into the world’s most valuable pharma companies. At the same time, shortages have created a lucrative market for compounders and telehealth companies. But for patients, the situation is far less fortunate. These changes could cut off access to affordable alternatives for thousands of people, including Rising. “There’s a lot of folks really panicked right now about it. I don’t want to go back to having crazy pain every day from PCOS either,” Rising said. Rising now has few options. She could switch to an expensive branded medication or — what she intends to do — continue her treatment with a customized, clinically necessary compounded version of tirzepatide that meets stricter regulatory standards. But that path is more uncertain. Recent FDA decisions are reshaping the market for compounded (or off-brand) versions of GLP-1 drugs, which have served as a workaround during supply shortages. The move has also intensified a battle between Big Pharma and compounding pharmacies over control of GLP-1 sales in the U.S. Compounding involves modifying FDA-approved drugs to meet individual patient needs, such as adjusting dosages, changing administration methods, or removing allergens — the kind of customization Rising is now relying on to access tirzepatide. Typically, the FDA prohibits compounding drugs that are exact copies of commercially available medications. However, when a drug is in shortage, these types of compounded versions are allowed. This regulatory loophole has proved lucrative for compounding pharmacies. Olympia Pharmaceuticals, which entered the GLP-1 market just 18 months ago, has seen demand surge by 15-20%. The company’s CFO, Joshua Fritzler, said in a February media roundtable that Olympia’s phones now ring constantly with doctors and patients “panicking” about where they’ll obtain medication when the FDA’s new restrictions take effect. Olympia is a member of the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA) trade group that sued the FDA twice over the removal of tirzepatide and then semaglutide (Ozempic’s active ingredient) from its shortage list. The group argued that the shortages persist and that the FDA’s decision will harm patients by limiting access to affordable alternatives. A judge recently sided with the FDA in the tirzepatide case and the agency has issued a clarification on its policies regarding compounded GLP-1s. The FDA will begin enforcing rules against outsourcing facilities making compounded tirzepatide on March 19. Smaller pharmacies (503A’s) are already past their deadline. For compounded semaglutide, 503A pharmacies have until April 22 and 503B facilities have until May 22 — or until there is a court decision in the semaglutide case, whichever date comes later. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly have both contended that compounded versions of their medications are unsafe. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,” Novo Nordisk said in a statement when the FDA declared the end of the semaglutide shortage. Eli Lilly made a similar statement: “FDA was also clear that compounders must immediately begin transitioning patients taking compounded tirzepatide knockoffs to FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines.” However, both companies have a big financial interest in limiting the sales of compounded GLP-1s. Eli Lilly’s stock price has climbed more than 50% since the FDA approved Zepbound in November 2023, pushing its market cap above $800 billion. Novo Nordisk has similarly seen its stock rise 86% since Wegovy launched in 2021. Novo Nordisk’s U.S. executive vice president, David Moore, recently told investors in February that compounded drugs were cutting into the company’s sales more rapidly than expected. Meanwhile, some compounders have also made a killing with GLP-1s. The millennial-targeted telehealth company Hims & Hers started offering compounded semaglutide last May. The company’s total sales grew 69% last year to $1.5 billion. “Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims CEO Andrew Dudum wrote in a post on X in February. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages.” Fritzler said GLP-1 medications make up about half of Olympia’s business by volume, with the company producing tens of thousands of vials each week. Despite this, he emphasized that Olympia will comply with regulations and will not attempt to circumvent the law by creating customized compounded GLP-1s. Fritzler told Quartz that he expects that most patients will transition to branded medications, while others might switch to liraglutide — an older and less effective GLP-1 drug that requires daily injections rather than the weekly regimen of newer medications. For others, the cost and inconvenience has become too overwhelming. Michelle Pierce, 25, is a patient from Austin who also has relied on a compounded semaglutide to treat her PCOS. She first tried metformin, a common type 2 diabetes medication, but it wasn’t effective for her. Her doctor then recommended a GLP-1 drug, but getting insurance coverage was a challenge, requiring an extensive pre-authorization process and two appeals. Even after approval, the $600 monthly cost for Ozempic was too high, so her doctor suggested compounded semaglutide as a more affordable alternative. Now, however, she fears she won’t be able to afford treatment moving forward. Instead, she plans to taper off the medication over the next few months, despite concerns that stopping it could affect her insulin levels and carries the risk of regaining weight. “I have great insurance — private Aetna (CVS) insurance — and I still can’t get a medication that has changed my life,” Pierce said.

Title: Rocket Lab boosts Varda's space manufacturing with third successful orbital mission

This deployment follows closely on the heels of Varda's W-2 mission, which concluded with a successful reentry and landing just 15 days prior. Like its predecessor, the W-3 mission is powered by Rocket Lab's advanced Pioneer spacecraft platform. Pioneer provides critical support to Varda's 120kg manufacturing capsule in orbit, supplying power, communication links, propulsion, and attitude control throughout the mission. The capsule enables Varda to conduct pharmaceutical production in microgravity, a unique environment that cannot be replicated on Earth and is particularly advantageous for certain drug development processes. The Pioneer spacecraft incorporates Rocket Lab's comprehensive suite of in-house designed components and subsystems. These include propulsion units, flight control software, avionics, star trackers, reaction wheels, separation mechanisms, solar arrays, communication systems, composite structures, and propellant tanks. Upon completion of the manufacturing operations in orbit, Rocket Lab manages the deorbit process, executing maneuvers to guide the capsule back toward Earth. The mission plan concludes with reentry and landing at the Koonibba Test Range in South Australia, which is managed by Southern Launch. This marks Rocket Lab's third successful mission for Varda; the inaugural W-1 mission ended with a landing in Utah in February 2024, while W-2 concluded with a touchdown in South Australia on February 27, 2025. "The W-1 mission was the first in-space manufacturing mission to happen outside of the International Space Station. Now, just over a year later, we have a third mission on orbit after bringing another one safely back home. We're immensely proud to have supported our mission partner Varda to usher in a new era of rapid, reliable, and innovative commercial in-space manufacturing and hypersonic reentry capability," said Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab Founder and CEO. "It's remarkable that we have been able to launch our third mission in such rapid succession after the reentry of our second. High cadence launch and return will soon be commonplace, and reentry of materials from space to Earth will go from being novel to being normal," said Wendy Shimata, VP of Autonomous Systems at Varda. Rocket Lab's fourth Pioneer spacecraft for Varda is nearing completion, with final assembly taking place at the company's Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

Now, just over a year later, we have a third mission on orbit after bringing another one safely back home. We're immensely proud to have supported our mission partner Varda to usher in a new era of rapid, reliable, and innovative commercial in-space manufacturing and hypersonic reentry capability," said Sir Peter Beck, Rocket Lab Founder and CEO. "It's remarkable that we have been able to launch our third mission in such rapid succession after the reentry of our second. High cadence launch and return will soon be commonplace, and reentry of materials from space to Earth will go from being novel to being normal," said Wendy Shimata, VP of Autonomous Systems at Varda. Rocket Lab's fourth Pioneer spacecraft for Varda is nearing completion, with final assembly taking place at the company's Spacecraft Production Complex and Headquarters in Long Beach, California.

The mission, named "The Lightning God Reigns," lifted off from Launch Complex 1 at Mahia, New Zealand, on March 15, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. NZDT (00:00 UTC). The Electron rocket delivered iQPS' QPS-SAR-9 satellite into a circular orbit 575 kilometers above Earth. This launch follows a December 2023 mission in which Rocket Lab deployed another SAR satellite for iQPS, supporting the development of its radar imaging satellite network. This successful deployment is the first of eight planned launches for iQPS under one of Rocket Lab's largest launch contracts. The agreement includes five more missions in 2025 and two in 2026, all contributing to iQPS' vision of a 36-satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation. The system is designed to deliver high-resolution, all-weather, day-and-night Earth observation capabilities worldwide. Rocket Lab's next mission for iQPS is targeted for no earlier than May 2025. The company's founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, emphasized the significance of Electron's role in enabling constellation missions: "Congratulations to the Rocket Lab and iQPS teams on yet another successful mission together. Every Electron launch in 2025 so far has been to expand a satellite constellation and with this latest mission success, you can see why. Electron provides our customers with total flexibility and control over their schedule, orbit, and other critical mission elements to create their constellation exactly as they need it. We're looking forward to continuing our constellation build out for iQPS this year and next." Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, CEO of iQPS, highlighted the collaboration's efficiency: "I sincerely appreciate the dedication and hard work of the teams at iQPS and Rocket Lab in making this launch mission a success, and I am truly impressed by the short timeline from QPS-SAR-9's departure from Fukuoka, Japan, through its journey via Mahia Peninsula, to its successful deployment into LEO. As we prepare for the launch of seven more QPS-SARs between this year and next year, I am reassured by the reliability and efficiency of Electron in executing missions like this one." Rocket Lab is set to launch its next mission from Launch Complex 1 in just three days, with liftoff scheduled for March 18, 2025 NZDT.

March 16, 2025 21:48 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: Developing the future workforce

Time Published: 2025-03-16T22:56:00Z

Large-scale layoffs have continued in recent months, indicating ongoing economic challenges. Contributing factors include a decline in domestic purchasing power and growing external pressures, caused by the trade war. As the job market remains uncertain, businesses are calling on the government to accelerate the development of a workforce better suited to meet both global and local demands. More manufacturers, especially those in the car and auto parts industries, are likely to lay off workers or close this year as they succumb to a plunge in domestic sales, worsened by the impact of the new tariff policy and trade war triggered by US President Donald Trump, said Tanit Sorat, vice-chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry. More than 100 factories were shuttered monthly last year for the second year in a row, according to Kasikorn Research Center. This rate will certainly continue in 2025, said Mr Tanit. "We should see a number of factory closures near the end of the second quarter," he said. The shutdowns will mainly be in the automotive industry, which has experienced sluggish sales since 2023, said Mr Tanit. Last year domestic vehicle sales plunged by 26.1% year-on-year due mainly to banks and financing companies' strict criteria for auto loans, concerned about non-performing loans given the high level of household debt, according to the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI). "This is a very serious situation for automakers when one-fourth of total sales disappears," said Mr Tanit. "Some auto manufacturers have avoided layoffs for two years, but they will let a number of workers go this year, with Trump's policy the catalyst." Trump announced last month he would impose a 25% tariff on car imports on April 2, but the levy on shipments from Canada and Mexico was paused for one month after taking effect on March 4. The FTI earlier warned of the negative impact on passenger cars and commercial motor vehicles exported to the US, while local auto parts makers are worried the new tariff policy will affect their exports to Japanese auto companies invested in Mexico. "We also export auto parts to the US, especially tyres popular among American customers," he said. Other industries, especially plastics, garments and furniture, will also be affected by Trump's tariff policy as the US-China trade war will worsen the influx of low-cost Chinese products, dealing a blow to local manufacturers and workers, warned the FTI. Mr Tanit said he does not expect an alarming increase to the overall unemployment rate in Thailand this year. However, roughly 420,000 people will graduate from academic institutions this year, adding more pressure to job-seekers in a highly competitive labour market. "We've been trapped at a low employment level for 10 years, stuck at this bottom level," he said. (photo credit : Somchai Poomlard) Prasert Taedullayasatit, president of the Thai Condominium Association, said many residential developers have trimmed their organisations for a while based on weak market signals over the past few years. "The layoffs this year stemmed from poor performance the previous year," he said. "Reducing staff is one way to cut costs. Some companies reduced employees in investment businesses that did not meet expectations." According to the 2024 financial statements of 24 listed developers primarily engaged in residential development, only three reported a year-on-year rise in net profit margin as a percentage of revenue, while 14 posted a decline and seven reported losses. One of the two companies that were reported to have laid off up to 40% of their staff saw their net profit margins plummet, falling from more than 22% in 2023 to just 11% last year. Another firm experienced a nosedive from 8.9% to just 2.3%. Mr Prasert, also chief operating officer of SET-listed Ananda Development, said it has frozen new hires for a while, and when employees leave it does not hire replacements. Therdsak Thaveeteeratham, executive vice-president of Asia Plus Securities, said the layoffs by property developers are a response to the market slowdown. "Layoffs are one strategy to cut costs and reduce expenses. There is no cause for concern," he said. This strategy of managing costs through workforce reduction reflects how developers are adjusting to a challenging real estate market, focusing on operational efficiency during times of uncertainty. Sutee Ketsiri, managing director of homebuilder Built To Build Group, said residential development has been unfavourable for two years, with a decline in sales prompting contractors to take on construction jobs from clients other than developers. "The number of home construction jobs, even from large developers, has shrunk significantly, causing many contractors to increasingly take on self-built home jobs over the past year," he said. Jackie Wang, country director of Google Thailand, said Thailand is experiencing a rapid technological shift across several industries. While some jobs may evolve in response to the automation of certain tasks, the greater potential of artificial intelligence (AI) lies in augmenting skills humans perform well, she said. AI can be leveraged to amplify human strengths in creativity, empathy and critical thinking at work, said Ms Wang. "For the tech industry, we continue to see strong demand for roles specialising in AI development, cloud computing and cybersecurity, to name a few. At Google, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas, such as AI and cloud," she said. Ms Wang said for students or those looking to prepare for the AI-driven future, foundational skills such as communication, problem solving and critical thinking will be even more important in this dynamic environment. People should also have a good understanding of AI tools, she said. "We have recommended governments invest in building an AI-ready workforce by adapting skills programmes across sectors, developing national AI training and support programmes, and establishing public-private partnerships to scale these programmes and make them accessible to all workers," said Ms Wang. "We are committed to working with partners on this issue. For instance, our digital training programme Samart Skills has trained 13,000 students and job-seekers in Thailand thus far." She said over the past five years, Google trained more than 3.6 million Thais, including students, educators, small and medium-sized enterprises and developers. "AI presents incredible opportunities for us to evolve and create a more productive and fulfilling work environment, while boosting local economic growth," said Ms Wang. "I encourage people to approach AI with curiosity and optimism, and I am excited for the opportunities it will open up." Prae Dumrongmongcolgul, country director of Facebook Thailand, said the integration of AI has revolutionised the IT industry, driving a significant surge in demand for professionals skilled in AI programming languages such as Python, machine learning, data engineering and data science. This transformation is not unique to the IT industry, as AI has touched companies and organisations worldwide in different ways, she said. "However, we believe human-AI collaboration remains crucial to advancing this technology. By showcasing how AI can augment human capabilities rather than replace them, we can unlock its full potential," said Ms Prae. She said Meta has developed tools that enhance productivity, such as AI assistants that help write basic code blocks, allowing engineers to focus on more advanced tasks. Ms Prae said rather than replacing jobs, AI supplements them, offering endless possibilities. For example, AI can enhance medical diagnoses with accurate and efficient tools, or help business owners predict customer purchases, as well as create new professions, just as the internet gave rise to web development, she said. "As technology evolves, jobs change and new ones emerge," said Ms Prae. "Ultimately the future of work is not about replacement but augmentation, and we are committed to developing AI solutions that empower humans to achieve their full potential." Somchai Sittichaisrichart, managing director of SiS Distribution (Thailand), said the local tech industry still faces a shortage of workers, particularly in cybersecurity, cloud and AI. He said youngsters are not interested in learning tech skills, while emerging technology evolves all the time. The tech industry will likely continue to face a worker shortage, said Mr Somchai. Regarding concerns that AI will replace human workers in Thailand, he said it will not happen soon, but could start in two years. Vatsun Thirapatarapong, country manager of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Thailand, said the tech industry has robust demand for people with AI skills, which should continue to increase. AWS regularly updates courseware to train AI skills in the tech and non-tech sectors. The company aims to produce 100,000 AI-ready workers by 2026. Maneerut Anulomsombut, chief executive of Sea (Thailand), a Singaporean internet tech firm, said the economic uncertainty is causing cautious talent acquisition among Thai companies, including those in the tech sector. Every organisation prioritises recruiting individuals skilled in tech fields, she said. A group of former employees of Alpha Spinning, AMC Spinning and Body Fashion (Thailand) staged a protest demanding the government urgently help laid-off workers last week. (photo credit: Chanat Katanyu) Pun Paniangvait, general manager of Thai President Foods Plc, the manufacturer of Mama instant noodles, said the company expects to expand its workforce in line with the growth of its manufacturing operations. The company employs more than 6,000 staff and consistently implements new technologies including robotics to reduce the workload in certain areas of production, such as heavy lifting of ingredients. The use of robots lifts productivity and improves labour welfare, he said. For example, once the instant noodles are produced, robots handle the packing process and arrange the products on pallets, reducing the reliance on staff for various stages of production. A typical production line now operates with about 25 workers, a decrease from 30 in years past. The company also integrated AI to improve efficiency in administrative tasks such as summarising reports. The use of labour-saving machinery could help the company remain resilient amid rising labour costs, said Mr Pun. "The main goal is to keep the labour cost per unit of Mama manageable," he said. "By using labour-saving machinery, we can enhance worker productivity and potentially reduce the average labour cost per unit." Mr Pun said the company usually raises the daily minimum wage annually, regardless of government policy. He said the positions most often in demand are mechanics with vocational or higher vocational certificates who possess the skills and experience necessary to begin work immediately. Mr Pun said the government should offer more support for vocational education. Furthermore, he encouraged local businesses to collaborate with vocational colleges to provide on-the-job training, which could create a pool of skilled workers in specific areas and reduce labour migration to industrial cities such as Rayong. This could increase economic growth in the provinces and distribute wealth across the country, said Mr Pun. Thaniwan Kulmongkol, president of the Thai Restaurant Association, said restaurant operators with sufficient resources are more inclined to invest in automation technologies. She pointed to the rising trend of restaurants adopting self-service systems, like ordering through tablets or kiosks and implementing self-pickup stations. This shift not only decreases reliance on manpower, but also opens avenues for restaurant growth without the stress of workforce shortages, said Mrs Thaniwan. There are still many opportunities within the restaurant industry to incorporate technology, especially in back-end systems that help with managing raw materials and calculating food costs, she said. However, the industry will continue to hire staff, as the cost of implementing technology in restaurants remains high, said Mrs Thaniwan. "Even in restaurants that embrace automation, there is still a need for employees to monitor these systems," she said. "Workers must develop the necessary skills to operate and maintain this technology." Labour shortages are a persistent challenge for restaurants, leading some operators to offer daily wages that exceed the minimum wage, said Mrs Thaniwan. Thai workers are often hesitant to accept jobs in restaurants based on the demanding nature of the work and relatively low wages, she said. In contrast, foreign workers are more willing to take these positions, as earning 10,000 baht is a substantial income for them, said Mrs Thaniwan. She proposed restaurant operators restructure their pay systems to offer wages aligned with educational qualifications, though this may result in higher food prices. Mrs Thaniwan emphasised the need for a significant overhaul of Thailand's educational system to ensure the workforce is equipped with the technological skills necessary for the evolving industry. Sanan Angubolkul, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said total employment tallied 40.1 million in 2024, including 19.5 million in services and trade, 11.8 million in agriculture and 8.72 million in manufacturing. The unemployment total is roughly 390,000. Labour Ministry data indicates 19.2% of surveyed businesses, totalling 2,254 enterprises, are actively seeking workers. The sectors with the highest demand include wholesale and retail trade, automotive and motorcycle repair services, accounting for 36% of demand from 812 enterprises; manufacturing comprised 17.9%, with 403 enterprises hiring; and construction, making up 11.3% or 254 enterprises. Mr Sanan said the challenges include an ageing population, declining birth rates, low labour productivity, decreased worker skills, and a gap between labour market needs and worker quality. "The quality of education, both formal and vocational, needs improvement," he said. Given these challenges, the integration of AI in the workforce has become increasingly relevant, especially in the industrial and service sectors, said Mr Sanan. AI is recognised for its potential to enhance efficiency and reduce labour costs. He pointed to China's initiative to introduce AI courses in primary and secondary education in Beijing, aimed at positioning the nation as a future technological superpower. "This approach offers a valuable model for the Thai government to consider when formulating labour and education policies that can enhance Thailand's labour productivity in line with future demands," said Mr Sanan. "Establishing AI training institutes in provinces is an essential step to equip the future workforce." Employers will continue to rely on human talent, as qualities like creativity, craftsmanship, effective communication and the ability to solve intricate problems remain beyond the reach of AI, he said.

Title: Microsoft's 1986 IPO

David L. Farquhar on technology old and new, computer security, and more Home » Retro Computing » Microsoft’s 1986 IPO On March 13, 1986, Microsoft shook up the financial world, and to some degree, we are still feeling the reverberations from that 40 years later. That was the day of Microsoft’s very successful IPO. The hunt for the next Microsoft began immediately, leading directly to the dotcom bubble of the turn of the century. Microsoft’s IPO initially valued company at $21.00 per share. It raised $61 million for the company, and put its market capitalization at $777 million. The price peaked at $35.50 per share before settling to $27.75 at the end of the day. Microsoft expected it to take weeks to reach $27.75. Bill Gates owned 45% of the company’s stock, which meant on March 14, 1986, he was worth almost $350 million. He had not yet turned 31. The next year, he became the youngest person to become a billionaire, before he had turned 32. Founded in 1975, Microsoft was an 11-year-old company at the time it went public. They waited so long because Bill Gates wanted to maintain control over the company as long as he could. By 1986, Microsoft had to go public. This wasn’t because they needed money. Their profit margins were enviable, at 34% of their pre tax revenue. Microsoft didn’t need the $61 million the IPO raised. The reason Microsoft had to go public in 1986 was because Bill Gates had been using stock to attract talent. Microsoft projected that by sometime in 1987, they would have 500 shareholders, which would require Microsoft to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effectively turning them into a publicly traded company, but without the benefits of going public in the conventional way. Backed into this corner, Gates agreed in late 1985 to pursue an IPO. Motley Fool greatly oversimplifies Microsoft’s early years, as do others. They’re better at SEO than analysis. Microsoft’s best known products in 1986 were PC DOS and MS-DOS, the text-based operating systems for IBM and IBM-compatible PCs. In 1986, Microsoft Windows existed, barely, but wasn’t yet successful. Microsoft’s secret was that virtually every computer on the market was running some Microsoft product. Its operating system powered the booming PC market. But Excel was the most popular spreadsheet on the Macintosh. Its predecessor, Multiplan, was a reasonably popular spreadsheet on other platforms. Microsoft Word was an up and coming word processor. Microsoft Basic was one of the most popular programming languages, and ran on virtually every platform. Sometimes Microsoft licensed software on a royalty basis and sometimes for a flat rate up front. Getting the flat rate up front shielded Microsoft from losing profits to piracy early on. But once Microsoft could afford to risk some loss to piracy, it was more profitable to take a royalty per unit sold. There were 60 million IBM and IBM-compatible PCs sold in the 1980s, and Microsoft collected a royalty on virtually every single one. Then in 1991, it discovered it could sell new versions of MS-DOS as upgrades and make money on each unit sold a second time. When Windows 3.0 hit the market in May 1990, the game was essentially over. Microsoft could sell you an operating system, a graphical environment, and versions of Word and Excel that ran in that environment, all running on commodity hardware that was getting cheaper by the quarter, if not the month. Although it would be a few years before other companies would give up, a monopoly in operating systems and office suites was inevitable before 1990 was over. The more successful Microsoft became, the more afraid of failure and anticompetitive it became. This led to legal issues in the late 1990s. Microsoft reformed to a degree and is more tolerant of certain competing products continuing to exist than it was in the 90s. Today, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (formerly Google) are larger than Microsoft, but the four companies are the only technology firms in the 2024 Fortune 20 list. The fifth largest technology firm is Meta, the social media company everyone loves to hate, at #30. To this day, young ambitious people enroll in school to get technical degrees in hopes of becoming the next Bill Gates, and venture capitalists like Kevin O’Leary and Marc Andreessen (himself a cofounder of a failed dotcom) prey on them. These ambitious programmer/entrepreneurs rarely get rich, but the venture capitalists have figured out how to make money even as the businesses they fund fail. Today’s entrepreneurs would do well to note that Microsoft made minimal use of venture capital. Microsoft’s only VC only owned 6.2 percent of the company. Gates didn’t trust them. If you’re thinking of trying your hand at being the next Bill Gates, keep that in mind. Another direct consequence of the Microsoft IPO was the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and the subsequent recession. Fear of missing out on the next Microsoft drove up the value of anything tech- or Internet-related. Investors believed the next Microsoft would come out of that generation of companies. In the end they were kind of right. Two companies from that wave ended up matching and eventually eclipsing Microsoft. But it wasn’t exactly clear until a few years after the dotcom bust that Amazon and Google would be the ones to do it. Short-lived randos like VA Linux, Geocities, Cyberrebate, and Internet America were able to come along for the ride while the market shook out.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round.

Title: Gensol fast-charged Blu-Smart. But their ties are a governance puzzle

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Bengaluru: On 16 January, Refex Industries Ltd, a manufacturer of refrigerant gases, informed the stock exchanges that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Refex Green Mobility, had agreed to buy 2,997 electric cars from Gensol Engineering Ltd. Refex Green Mobility would take over Gensol’s existing loan of ₹315 crore as part of this transaction. Gensol Engineering Ltd also informed the same to the exchanges. Shares of Refex ended 1.6% higher the next day, while shares of Gensol remained unchanged. This transaction came under the spotlight after Gensol, a solar engineering, procurement and electric vehicle (EV) financing company, saw two rating agencies downgrade its borrowing to default earlier this month. Rating agency Icra even said Gensol is falsifying statements. Gensol denies any wrongdoing and claims that this sale should help reduce its debt, from ₹1,146 crore to ₹831 crore. So, why is there a problem? Many unanswered questions linger, particularly around the company’s ties with the privately held Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd, the electric cab-hailing service. Blu-Smart was co-founded by Anmol Singh Jaggi; the 39-year-old is also the chairman and managing director of Gensol. In Gensol’s EV financing business, the company buys cars and then leases them to other companies. Gensol acknowledges that it owns 2,997 EVs that are part of Blu-Smart’s fleet. But that’s not the complete story—Blu-Smart’s fleet consists of 8,000 cars and Gensol, according to people Mint spoke to, owns a meaty share of this number. While Gensol didn’t disclose the overall number of cars it owns, and the number it leased to Blu-Smart, a spokesperson for Blu-Smart stated that multiple lessors lease out vehicles to the ride hailing company. According to two investors courted by Blu-Smart, two board members, and one proxy advisory firm executive, Gensol’s lack of transparency about its close ties with the cab-hailing company, particularly around the money spent on cars and loans granted, raises questions around Gensol’s corporate governance practices. Essential details, including the terms of lease partnerships, remain shrouded in mystery. Above all, a Mint investigation reveals that Gensol’s balance sheet has been used to build Blu-Smart’s business even as the cab-hailing company continues to be a privately owned one. Mint reviewed Gensol and Blu-Smart’s financials, including an investment proposal made by the electric cab-hailing service to prospective investors in October last year. We also spoke with seven executives to piece together this story. Growing togetherJaggi founded Gensol in 2012 as a strategic advisory firm. By 2017, he started a solar engineering and procurement business. Two years later, in 2019, Gensol went public. The same year, Jaggi started a new business division, Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd, to finance EVs. Outside of Gensol, in 2019, Jaggi also set up Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd. View Full Image A file photo of Anmol Singh Jaggi, CMD of Gensol and co-founder, Blu-Smart. (Mint) First, let us examine Gensol’s EV lease business and Blu-Smart’s journey to understand the ties between the two firms better. Up until 2022, Gensol’s EV lease business was almost a non-starter. According to Gensol’s investor presentations, the business reported ₹4 crore in revenue in FY20; ₹3 crore in FY21, and ₹5 crore in FY22. By the end of March 2022, the EV business owned a little over 700 cars, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. According to the same executive, Blu-Smart started with 70 cars in 2019. In its early days, it received a $3 million investment from angel investors. By March 2021, it had 400 cars and hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million. The number of cars on its platform more than doubled to 900 in FY22, when its ARR touched $8 million. Gensol’s EV business showed its first real growth in FY23 when it reported ₹41 crore in revenue, followed by ₹134 crore in FY24. Growth at Blu-Smart also picked up during this time. It ended FY23 with 3,100 cars and an annual revenue rate of $29 million, while the number of cars more than doubled to 7,300 last year. Its ARR totalled $60 million. In April-December 2024, 72.3%, or ₹764 crore, of Gensol’s ₹1,056 crore revenue was generated from the solar EPC business. The remaining 27.7%, or ₹294, came from the EV leasing arm, according to the company’s latest investor presentation. Gensol was, and continues to be, Blu-Smart’s largest car supplier, accounting for over 87% of its 8,000 fleet, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. Consequently, Blu-Smart has emerged as Gensol’s largest customer for its EV lease business, accounting for over 90% of the ₹294 crore business it received in the first nine months of the current financial year, the executive further mentioned. The fuelSo, where did Gensol get the money from to expand its EV leasing business, which, in turn, fuelled Jaggi’s privately held electric cab business? In 2021, Gensol first received ₹35.55 crore from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (Ireda), a state-owned company, for its EV lease business. In August 2022, Gensol told investors that it had received Ireda’s nod to buy 3,000 EVs. In January last year, Gensol said that Ireda had sanctioned a fatter loan— ₹513 crore—one that would allow the company to finance 3,800 EVs. An Ireda spokesperson told Mint that Gensol has utilized the loans given to finance cars for Blu-Smart Mobility. This implies that Ireda knew Gensol was building an EV ride-hailing business through Blu-Smart. At the end of December 2024, Ireda had unpaid loans of ₹470 crore from Gensol, according to Icra, the ratings agency. The modelWhy couldn’t Ireda give loans to Blu-Smart directly? Probably because Blu-Smart always wanted to remain an asset-light business. “No Asset Ownership Burden—Company Managed Cars", Blu-Smart claims on the third page of its 25-page investment deck sent to prospective investors in October 2024. Mint reviewed a copy of this document. The privately-held firm is yet to file its financials with the ministry of corporate affairs for the year ending March 2024. According to this investor presentation, Blu-Smart had 8,000 cars as on 31 September 2024. Gensol, meanwhile, didn’t tell Mint how many cars it owns overall, limiting its commentary to the transaction it inked with Refex in January this year. “Gensol is the owner of these 2,997 cars and post the transaction, Refex would be leasing the same vehicles to BluSmart," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. “Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL), was an early supporter of BluSmart’s EV mission and as BluSmart has increased its presence, multiple more lessors have now leased vehicles to BluSmart," the spokesperson added. Apart from Gensol (which owns over 87% or about 7,000 of Blu-Smart’s fleet), other leasers include state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd and Quiklyz, the vehicle leasing and subscription business of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd.

The important thing which has not been reported until now is that Gensol spent ₹568 crore in the three years to March 2024 to buy electric cars, according to a review of the company’s annual reports by Mint. In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively. Simply put, Gensol spent over ₹500 crore last year to build Blu-Smart, considering that most of the cars bought by the firm in 2024 ( ₹352.14 crore) were also leased to the ride hailing firm. This is not a small amount considering that on 3 March, Care Ratings Ltd downgraded Gensol’s ₹716 crore bank loan to default, citing delays in “servicing of term loan obligations". Subsequently, Gensol termed it a temporary financial crunch and assured investors it would tide over these problems. The company’s shares closed at ₹262.25 on 13 March, down 67% from a year ago. The questionsThe close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. Nonetheless, some large investors appear to be keeping a distance from the two firms given their close ties. “In our due diligence of Gensol, we saw the close ties. This was one of the reasons why we decided not to invest in the company," said the head of a Mumbai-based portfolio management services firm who didn’t want to be identified. The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies. This came in the aftermath of the financial crime investigation agency probing an alleged small-cap stock market manipulation fraud. A puzzling nature of the ties between Gensol and Blu-Smart is that even though Gensol describes transactions with Blu-Smart as ‘related-party transactions’, Blu-Smart hasn’t reported its financial ties with Gensol as ‘transactions with connected parties’ in its filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. “Gensol is a listed company. Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore). It is unclear if Gensol and Refex have received approval from the creditors to transfer this loan. “The specific transaction is under the process of getting all necessary approvals," said a spokesperson from Blu-Smart. Anmol Jaggi’s plans to do things too fast (take on Uber and change the face of India’s cab hailing market) may have landed Gensol in a difficult spot for now, Subramanian of InGovern said. Jaggi founded Gensol in 2012 as a strategic advisory firm. By 2017, he started a solar engineering and procurement business. Two years later, in 2019, Gensol went public. The same year, Jaggi started a new business division, Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd, to finance EVs. Outside of Gensol, in 2019, Jaggi also set up Blu-Smart Mobility Ltd. First, let us examine Gensol’s EV lease business and Blu-Smart’s journey to understand the ties between the two firms better. Up until 2022, Gensol’s EV lease business was almost a non-starter. According to Gensol’s investor presentations, the business reported ₹4 crore in revenue in FY20; ₹3 crore in FY21, and ₹5 crore in FY22. By the end of March 2022, the EV business owned a little over 700 cars, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. According to the same executive, Blu-Smart started with 70 cars in 2019. In its early days, it received a $3 million investment from angel investors. By March 2021, it had 400 cars and hit an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million. The number of cars on its platform more than doubled to 900 in FY22, when its ARR touched $8 million. Gensol’s EV business showed its first real growth in FY23 when it reported ₹41 crore in revenue, followed by ₹134 crore in FY24. Growth at Blu-Smart also picked up during this time. It ended FY23 with 3,100 cars and an annual revenue rate of $29 million, while the number of cars more than doubled to 7,300 last year. Its ARR totalled $60 million. In April-December 2024, 72.3%, or ₹764 crore, of Gensol’s ₹1,056 crore revenue was generated from the solar EPC business. The remaining 27.7%, or ₹294, came from the EV leasing arm, according to the company’s latest investor presentation. Gensol was, and continues to be, Blu-Smart’s largest car supplier, accounting for over 87% of its 8,000 fleet, according to a former Gensol executive who didn’t want to be identified. Consequently, Blu-Smart has emerged as Gensol’s largest customer for its EV lease business, accounting for over 90% of the ₹294 crore business it received in the first nine months of the current financial year, the executive further mentioned.

In FY24 alone, Gensol spent ₹352.14 crore to buy cars. Gensol granted ₹148.33 crore as loans to three Blu-Smart subsidiaries in the year ended March 2024: Blu-Smart Fleet Pvt. Ltd received ₹138.87 crore while Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd and Blu-Smart Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd received ₹9.19 crore and ₹0.27 crore, respectively. Simply put, Gensol spent over ₹500 crore last year to build Blu-Smart, considering that most of the cars bought by the firm in 2024 ( ₹352.14 crore) were also leased to the ride hailing firm. This is not a small amount considering that on 3 March, Care Ratings Ltd downgraded Gensol’s ₹716 crore bank loan to default, citing delays in “servicing of term loan obligations". Subsequently, Gensol termed it a temporary financial crunch and assured investors it would tide over these problems. The company’s shares closed at ₹262.25 on 13 March, down 67% from a year ago. The questionsThe close ties between the two firms have raised questions over corporate governance. “What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? What is the underlying security backing these loans?" asked Nitin Mangal, a Mumbai-based analyst who runs Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. Ltd, a Sebi-registered research firm. Gensol didn’t answer Mint’s questions on the nature of the loans given to Blu-Smart. “All material relationships between Gensol and BluSmart have been appropriately disclosed to both the Boards, the statutory auditors, lenders and the shareholders," said a spokesperson for Blu-Smart. Nonetheless, some large investors appear to be keeping a distance from the two firms given their close ties. “In our due diligence of Gensol, we saw the close ties. This was one of the reasons why we decided not to invest in the company," said the head of a Mumbai-based portfolio management services firm who didn’t want to be identified. The executive met with Anmol Jaggi and the senior management team in July 2021. What is the nature of these loans given to Blu-Smart (by Gensol)? Are these loans secured or unsecured? —Nitin Mangal Jaggi and his family owned 62.65% of Gensol (at the end of December 2024). Retail investors or individuals owning less than ₹2 lakh worth of shares owned about a fourth or 23.44%, while individuals owning more than ₹2 lakh worth of shares own 7.1% in the company. Non-resident Indians, corporate bodies and family offices own 5.44%. No foreign institutional investor, mutual fund or insurance company is an investor in Gensol. The Enforcement Directorate has taken control of the remaining 1.37% shares—they were previously owned by Hari Shankar Tibrewala, along with 13 other companies. This came in the aftermath of the financial crime investigation agency probing an alleged small-cap stock market manipulation fraud. A puzzling nature of the ties between Gensol and Blu-Smart is that even though Gensol describes transactions with Blu-Smart as ‘related-party transactions’, Blu-Smart hasn’t reported its financial ties with Gensol as ‘transactions with connected parties’ in its filings with the ministry of corporate affairs. “Gensol is a listed company. Transparency and trust are more important, and the audit committee chair, along with independent directors, should come clean and provide all information to investors," said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys Ltd and founder of Exfinity Ventures, a venture capital fund. “All these transactions, including giving loans to Blu-Smart and Matrix Gas and Renewables ( ₹231.85 crore in loan in 2023-24), are reminiscent of how Vijay Mallya used the cash of the liquor business for the aviation business. The problematic issue in Gensol’s case is that the lease conditions under which Gensol is leasing out its cars to Blu-Smart have not been disclosed, and so minority shareholders of Gensol are the ones losing out," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm. Listing dreamsSuch disclosures are especially needed since Blu-Smart has listing dreams. Beginning September 2024, Blu-Smart has been looking to raise $50 million ( ₹418 crore) at a pre-money valuation of $335 million. It told investors it expects to go public in the second half of next year. Gensol’s current problems could cripple that plan of going public. It is important to mention that weeks before Gensol’s issues surfaced publicly, Blu-Smart defaulted on ₹30 crore worth of bonds—in early February. This brings us back to the transaction of Refex buying 2,997 cars from Gensol. Refex Industries is a Chennai-based public company that trades coal, handles ash, and manufactures and re-fills refrigerant gases. Refex Green buys 2,997 cars and immediately leases them to Blu-Smart Mobility. Why? “[W]e have acquired the vehicle from Gensol and we will be giving it to BluSmart only. So, for us, it will be a monthly payment of lease rental for these vehicles," Refex’s managing director Anil Jain told analysts in a post-earnings interaction dated 27 January. It is unknown whether Blu-Smart, which defaulted on a ₹30 crore bond last month, can service the contract with Refex. “This essentially is an asset (2,997 cars) and liability ( ₹315 crore loan) transaction through which Gensol is looking to clean up its book. Gensol could have sold these cars to Blu-Smart. But we don’t know the financial position of Blu-Smart, and for this reason, Refex steps in," said Mangal. A questionnaire sent to Refex’s chief financial officer, Dinesh Kumar Agarwal, went unanswered. Refex said it is buying these 2,997 cars at book value. At ₹315 crore, the average price of a car is ₹10.5 lakh. Book value is the difference between the cost of a car and the depreciation that has occurred over time. Most new electric vehicles sell between ₹10 and ₹15 lakh. Even assuming a 20% depreciation in the first year, it is unclear how Gensol and Refex arrived at ₹10.5 lakh for the cars running under the Blu-Smart brand. In addition, there is little clarity on whose loan Refex is taking over. There is no cash involved in the transaction—Refex takes on Gensol’s ₹315 crore loan. A spokesperson from Ireda told Mint that its loan to Gensol is not being transferred. Other creditors include Power Finance Corp. Ltd (loans of ₹334.8 crore); HDFC Bank Ltd ( ₹26.4 crore); Tata Motors Finance Ltd ( ₹18.3 crore); and Axis Bank Ltd ( ₹15 crore). It is unclear if Gensol and Refex have received approval from the creditors to transfer this loan. “The specific transaction is under the process of getting all necessary approvals," said a spokesperson from Blu-Smart. Anmol Jaggi’s plans to do things too fast (take on Uber and change the face of India’s cab hailing market) may have landed Gensol in a difficult spot for now, Subramanian of InGovern said.

(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Last week, the S&P 500 hit correction territory, which is defined as a 10% decline from a previous high. Stocks rebounded on Friday. So, the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of former President Joe Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at 21 U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer. Consumer spending is crucial to U.S. economic growth, and January retail sales fell month-over-month. As noted, most of the weaker economic data has been of the soft variety, like consumer sentiment. Two months of tepid retail sales in a row would raise concerns about the durability of the consumer. Retail sales are inexorably linked with employment since income generally drives the ability to spend. Cracks are beginning to show in the employment picture. So, there are downside risks, but retail sales should see some increase month-over-month for February. Consumer Spending & Jobs As the growth scare unfolded and policy uncertainty increased, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to between two and three cuts, with the first cut expected in mid-June. The Fed meets on Wednesday, and while no changes to monetary policy are expected, Chair Jerome Powell’s statements will be closely followed. Markets will be keen to judge the timing of the next cut and the committee’s views on inflation and the health of the U.S. economy. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts There are no sure things when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks. For example, one thing we can learn from the past is that dreadful consumer confidence, high policy uncertainty, and stock market corrections don’t automatically spell doom for the future of stock returns. Long-term, stocks have been the best-performing investment, with an annualized return of 9.9%. The price for this ability to outrun inflation by a sizable margin and compound wealth has been periods of painful and unforeseeable declines. Recent stock declines reinforce the timeless advice to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term expenses. While stocks compound wealth over long periods, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, making them unreliable for short-term liability needs. Unlike in recent years with ultra-low bond yields, high-quality bonds have returned to their historical function of providing income and a safe haven as stocks and other risk assets have declined. Holding a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses can help cushion the impact of any stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to ride out stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership.

So, the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of former President Joe Biden’s term. Last Friday’s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party Trump’s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at 21 U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer.

Title: On the anniversary of the dot-com bubble bursting, is history repeating itself?

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. What would you do if you won $10 million? The winner of MrBeast's "Beast Games" told us he immediately started estate planning and exploring tax strategies. On the agenda today: But first: 25 years since the bubble burst. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. The sheer timing of the market's recent sell-off has an eerie precedent. As my colleague Matthew Fox reports, this month marks the 25th anniversary of the peak of the dot-com bubble. Back then, a burgeoning technology called the World Wide Web lit a fire under the markets. Stock valuations soared to dizzying levels. The boom times eventually gave way to an epic bust. In March 2000, the party stopped. The tech-heavy Nasdaq would lose nearly 80% of its value over the next few years. There are parallels between then and now. Today's AI mania looks much like the internet excitement of the late 1990s. Yet few expect a similar decline this time around. The IPO market is dormant and deal activity hasn't picked up. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told BI's Fox that the stock market is nowhere near a bubble. "In a bubble, everybody makes money," Belski said. Regardless, the market's high-fliers have been hit hard. Tesla has lost roughly half its value and warned the Trump administration that it could suffer from increased costs due to a trade war. Shares of Nvidia and Apple are teetering and the so-called Magnificent 7 suddenly doesn't look so magnificent anymore. While Trump's trade policies have fueled much of the market's recent declines, the Trump administration doesn't seem too perturbed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Thursday that the White House is unconcerned about "a little" market volatility. That isn't a ringing endorsement of things turning around anytime soon. Friday's rally alleviated some concerns and pulled the S&P 500 out of correction territory. But it is still in the red for the year. Here's to hoping we're not headed for dot-com déjà vu. Has the market sell-off gone too far? Or do you expect it to go down even more? Let me know your thoughts: today@businessinsider.com. Read the full story. Amazon's five-day return-to-office hit some speedbumps early on, with reports of office theft, a shortage of desks, and overflowing parking lots. Ten weeks into the rollout, we're checking in with Amazon employees across corporate departments and the country to see how they've adjusted. Eleven people told us their experiences, which ranged from energized and connected to depressed and demoralized. Plus, two employees explained why they left. Even before the stock market's whirlwind week, recession fears had been gripping Wall Street. BI spoke to financial planners who shared what you can do now to prepare for a possible recession. Their biggest advice? Do not panic. Fear can be a powerful motivator to take drastic measures. And if you haven't already, now is the time to build your emergency fund. Actions you can take now. Layoffs are the new normal in Big Tech, but is turning up the heat on "low performers" really the best strategy? Research says otherwise. Demanding versus demeaning — BI's Aki Ito doesn't think every tech exec is getting it right. Why firing them doesn't "raise the bar." Private equity is one of the most sought-after careers in the finance industry. These firms are increasingly driving the world of corporate dealmaking as investors flock to the sector. BI pulled publicly available data for 12 firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. Salaries for entry-level analysts start at $100,000, and for partners and managing directors, those salaries can soar up to $500,000. How much those in PE make. This week's quote: "No one in America should feel threatened or targeted simply for driving a vehicle." — A Cybertruck owner spoke to BI about facing growing hostility and verbal harassment. More of this week's top reads: A photographer took a shot of Trump's notes — and they read like a Tesla sales pitch. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.
