The “majority” of 138 children who are currently on an “active” waiting list for spinal surgery will have had their surgery performed or will have a date for their surgery before the end of 2024, according to Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly. A spokeswoman for the health minister said: “The Minister for Health expects the majority of those currently on the active waiting list to have received a date for surgery / have had their surgery before the end of the year.” The Minister’s office was asked to clarify the position following comments made by Limerick Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins, who said that the Minister told him that the waiting list would be reduced by at least 100 patients by the end of this year, leaving 38 patients on the active list. When asked for clarity on the figures Minister Donnelly’s office replied that “as of September 27th, 362 spinal surgeries have been completed this year to date”. It explained that while “there are currently 138 children actively waiting for a date for their surgery”, a total of “38 children are currently confirmed for outsourced initiatives in Ireland and abroad”, which included “16 children (who) have received a date to come in for surgery at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh”. According to CHI newly published figures, there were 248 children on the spinal surgery waiting list as of September 27th, including 138 patients who were ready for surgery and waiting for a date; 18 patients who were assigned a surgery date; 35 patients who had “an initial episode of care” and required a further procedure; and 57 patients who were suspended from the waiting list due to clinical reasons (11 patients), personal reasons (8 patients), or patients who were confirmed to have their surgery in a non CHI hospital under a CHI initiative (38 patients). “A number of international outsourcing initiatives have been finalised for children waiting on spinal surgeries. While this option is not suitable for all children waiting on spinal surgeries, dozens of children and families will be able to avail of the option to get their surgery abroad - They include Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in New York and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London,” Minister Donnelly’s office. “National outsourcing of spinal patients to Blackrock Clinic and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is already in progress.” The Minister’s office said: “CHI has implemented an extended operating theatre day and a ring-fenced theatre for spinal surgery to increase the number of procedures that are being carried out”. A Paediatric Spinal Taskforce, set up by the health minister, is being chaired by senior counsel Mark Connaughton, and includes patient advocacy groups, representatives from CHI, the HSE, the Ombudsman for Children, and the Department of Health. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Reality bites: Is Generation X in denial about its own impending retirement?
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/19/generation-x-retirement-denial/75731069007/

Is Generation X in denial about its own impending retirement? Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980, will be next to retire after the baby boom. It’s a generation largely defined by financial uncertainty: Generation X was the first to cope without ubiquitous workplace pensions, relying instead on a new savings tool called the 401(k). The Great Recession of 2008 stands as the generation’s defining economic event. Now, with the oldest Gen Xers pushing 60, the cohort may not be ready for its next life stage. A Wealth Watch survey from insurer New York Life is one of several recent reports that portray much of Generation X as woefully unprepared for their looming retirement. Fewer than half of Generation X, or 46%, are “actively planning for retirement,” New York Life found, even as they approach the milestone. Most of Generation X, or 70%, think they will retire “later than expected,” the survey found, “or not at all.” Only one-quarter of Gen-Xers believe they will retire on time. The survey, released in September, reached 2,230 adults. “There are a whole lot of Gen Xers who are finding themselves resigned to the fact that they’re basically going to be working forever,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, the personal finance site. Generation X’s retirement fears are not unwarranted. Gen Xers ages 45 to 54 had a median net worth of about $247,000 in 2022, according to the federal Survey of Consumer Finances. That’s less money than baby boomers had at the same age. Boomers in the 45-54 age group had a median net worth of about $265,000 in 2007, after adjusting for inflation. The contrast suggests Generation X has struggled more than other age groups to recover from the Great Recession of 2008. “I think there’s this cumulative wear and tear of different circumstances Gen X has had throughout their lives,” said KC Boas, head of retirement thought leadership and marketing at BlackRock, the global investment firm. Many in Generation X entered the workforce around the time of the dot-com bubble, the tech-stock boom that went bust in 2000, sending the stock market tumbling. Several years later, many Gen Xers were in their prime earning years when the Great Recession hit. Every generation suffered in 2008, but economic research suggests Gen X suffered more than most. “Older generations were hit much harder, in some ways, because they had more to lose,” said Catherine Collinson, CEO of the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. Late baby boomers, born between 1960 and 1965, were also in their top earning years when the Great Recession descended. Today, the “Beatlemania boomers” have much less retirement savings than Americans born in the 1950s or earlier. They and Gen X suffered a similar fate. Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, have fared better. The millennial generation is in a stronger financial position now than Gen X was at the same age, according to a new LendingTree analysis. As of 2022, millennials had a median net worth of $84,941, LendingTree reports. Generation X had a lower net worth at the same age: $78,333, after adjusting for inflation. Millennials are also better-off financially than boomers were at the same age. But boomers are much more likely than Gen X or millennials to have workplace pensions, a guaranteed source of retirement income. Generation X entered the workforce as workplace pensions were fading, leaving most workers to build their own retirement savings with 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts. But 401(k) plans were few and far between in the early years. Partly for that reason, many Gen Xers got a late start in retirement saving. “This all happened without access to education and guidance,” said Jessica Ruggles, corporate vice president of financial wellness at New York Life. “It wasn’t until much later that we did things like auto-enrollment and auto-contribution,” innovations that encourage higher rates of retirement saving. Schulz, of LendingTree, is 52: a quintessential Gen Xer. He got his first real job around 1995, in his early 20s. “I didn’t even really think of retirement, or anything like that, at that age,” he said. The typical Gen Xer began saving for retirement at age 30, half a decade later than millennials, according to the Transamerica Center. Today, the median Gen X household has $93,000 in retirement savings: Not nearly enough, in the eyes of many retirement planners. As a result, Transamerica found, most Gen Xers plan to keep working in retirement. Those figures come from the 2024 Transamerica Retirement Survey of Workers, which reached 5,730 workers. Other retirement surveys concur that Generation X faces a unique struggle in preparing for retirement. Only 60% of Gen Xers feel “on track” for retirement, the lowest share of any generation, according to the 2024 BlackRock Read on Retirement report. Three-fifths of Gen Xers worry they will outlive their retirement savings, BlackRock found. Only two-fifths of Gen Xers use a financial adviser, the lowest rate of any generation. Generation X also seems to have a credit card problem. More than one Gen X cardholder in four, or 27%, have maxed out their credit, Bankrate reported on Thursday. Gen-Xers are more likely than millennials or boomers to have exhausted their credit, the survey found. The finding is worrisome, retirement experts say, because consumers should be paying down their debt as they approach retirement, not charging it up. The Bankrate survey covered 3,576 adults. Meet the 'Beatlemania boomers.'They face a looming retirement crisis But here’s some good news, at least from a retirement perspective: Generation X is spending less on discretionary purchases in 2024, Bank of America reports. “Discretionary” is a category that covers non-essentials. And discretionary spending among Gen Xers is down 2% in the year ended August, according to internal Bank of America card data, the biggest drop of any generation. At the same time, Gen X is investing a larger share of its paycheck than other generations, according to a September report from Bank of America Institute. “Bottom line, they’re spending less and they’re investing more,” said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute. “It’s certainly a sign that Gen X is hopeful for the future. They think they will retire, and they think that in the future, those investments are going to pay off.”

Title: Mistral's models, Lightmatter's big raise, and Soniox debuts Omnio: This week in new AI launches

Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies. Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry. French AI startup Mistral announced two state-of-the-art edge models this week. Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B, dubbed les Ministraux, are for “on-device computing and at-the-edge use cases,” or devices such as smartphones and laptops. The models were developed “to provide a compute-efficient and low-latency solution” to companies working on applications such as “on-device translation, internet-less smart assistants,” and autonomous robots, Mistral said. Lightmatter, a startup that builds photonic tech for chips used in data centers, announced a $400 million Series D funding round this week that values the company at $4.4 billion. The round, which brings Lightmatter’s total capital raised to $850 million, was led by T. Rowe Price Associates. With the funding, Lightmatter said it plans to deploy its Passage technology to data center partners, “enabling the scaling required for sustained AI innovation.” “We’re not just advancing AI infrastructure — we’re reinventing it,” Lightmatter co-founder and chief executive Nick Harris said in a statement. “With Passage, the world’s fastest photonic engine, we’re setting a new standard for performance and breaking through the barriers that limit AI computing. This funding accelerates our ability to scale, delivering the supercomputers of tomorrow today.” Soniox, a startup focused on voice AI, debuted its multimodal AI model, Omnio, which the company claims can “understand” audio and text inputs. Omnio “excels at identifying speakers, their roles, and even the nuances of their interactions, including emotions, sentiment, and speaking styles,” Soniox said. The startup says its model is “on par” with OpenAI’s GPT-4o and other language models on benchmarks for text. The company was co-founded by Ambroz Bizjak and Klemen Simonic, formerly of Meta. Xscape Photonics, a startup using silicon photonics in data centers, announced a $44 million Series A funding round this week, which included investors such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Cisco (CSCO). The startup plans to use the funding to accelerate development of its ChromX platform, which is used for AI data center fabrics. “Historically, performance and scalability challenges have been addressed by building bigger data centers to train large language models,” Vivek Raghunathan, co-founder and chief executive of Xscape Photonics, said in a statement, adding that the process is unsustainable and leads to issues with cost and energy consumption. “At Xscape Photonics, we are on a mission to help our customers completely reimagine how they solve these challenges,” Raghunathan said. “This funding validates our mission and positions us for future growth to support next-generation AI data centers.” Boston Dynamics (HYMTF) announced a research partnership with Toyota Research Institute (TM) this week to use the institute’s large behavior models to accelerate development of its general-purpose humanoid robots. The robotics company also plans to use its electric Atlas robot to accelerate the humanoids. “There has never been a more exciting time for the robotics industry, and we look forward to working with TRI to accelerate the development of general-purpose humanoids,” Robert Playter, chief executive of Boston Dynamics, said in a statement. “This partnership is an example of two companies with a strong research-and-development foundation coming together to work on many complex challenges and build useful robots that solve real-world problems.” Tako, an AI search engine that visualizes information, announced a $5.75 million seed funding round this week. The startup uses the “world’s most authoritative data sources” to generate visuals that provide factual, up-to-date information, it said. With the funding, Tako aims to expand its tech’s capabilities, as well as “further its mission to combat misinformation and false narratives [...]” “Tako grounds research and storytelling in reality by turning real-time, authoritative data into visual representations of knowledge,” Alex Rosenberg, co-founder and chief executive of Tako, said. “We’re making it easier than ever to access and share reliable information. We’ll use this funding to accelerate our plan to index all the world’s authoritative data and push the boundaries of how factual information can be visualized and persuasively shared.” The startup was integrated into Perplexity’s search engine in May. Articul8, a software company focused on generative AI for enterprises, announced a collaboration with Amazon Web Services to help customers building on the AWS platform develop and deploy their generative AI applications faster. The software company provides a full-stack generative AI platform that helps developers build, deploy, and manage enterprise-grade applications. “Generative AI has the potential to transform entire industries, but its cost, complexity of deployment, and the required expertise around this emerging technology can be intimidating to customers,” Alan Braun, director of technology partnerships at AWS, said. “This Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Articul8 will expand their ability to provide solutions that enable customers to build and deploy enterprise-grade Generative AI applications on AWS and help customers achieve meaningful business outcomes at scale.”

Investing.com -- It was another busy week of market moves. Given earnings season is underway, we can expect it to get even more hectic. Here are Investing.com's stocks of the week: Netflix shares surged on Friday. At the time of writing, it is up more than 9% for the day. The move is, of course, in response to the streaming giant’s latest earnings release, which saw it report Q3 EPS of $5.40, $0.28 better than the analyst estimate of $5.12. Meanwhile, revenue for the quarter came in at $9.82 billion, above the consensus estimate of $9.77 billion. The company added 5.07 million subscribers during its third quarter versus 8.76 million net new subscribers in the year-ago period. However, the figure topped Wall Street estimates, helping send shares higher in early US trading. Furthermore, Netflix’s Q4 EPS guide of $4.23 topped the consensus of $3.90, with revenue expected to be $10.13 billion, above the consensus of $10 billion. Following the earnings release, analysts at Piper Sandler said Netflix stock is set up for “another strong year.” Taiwan Semi was another big mover this week. Early on Thursday, the company reported strong earnings and guidance, which resulted in a more than 9% rise. The company’s shares gained over 7% in the week. The semiconductor firm reported Q3 EPS of $1.94, $0.15 better than the analyst estimate of $1.79, while revenue for the quarter came in at $23.5 billion versus the consensus estimate of $23.3 billion. Taiwan Semi sees Q4 2024 revenue between $26.1-26.9 billion, above the consensus of $24.9 billion. Other chip stocks also rose on the back of the company’s earnings. For example, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) tapped a new all-time high in intra-day trading Thursday, with TSM stating in its earnings call that AI demand is “real.” Following the earnings release, analysts at Bank of America raised their price target for the stock to NT$1,400 “to reflect TSMC’s stronger 3Q results/4Q guidance, better AI strength, and solid industry leadership.” Nuclear stocks have staged a strong rally in recent weeks. The bullish run began in late September after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a landmark purchase power agreement with Constellation Energy to supply nuclear power for the tech giant's data centers. This week, it was announced that Kairos Power and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have signed a Master Plant Development Agreement to create a path to deploy a U.S. fleet of advanced nuclear power projects totaling 500 MW by 2035. Then two days later, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the latest tech giant to buy into nuclear power after revealing it has signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects—including enabling the construction of several new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). One of those agreements with Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, near Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear power station. The news surrounding nuclear has resulted in a boost for stocks in the sector. Here are just some of the big nuclear stock movers in the last week: While LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:LVMH) shares have managed to regain most of their losses, the stock fell sharply on Wednesday after the luxury group posted a 3% slide in third-quarter sales. The company said its third-quarter sales decline arose primarily “from lower growth seen in Japan, essentially due to the stronger yen.” The company also noted that “Hennessy cognac was held back by weak local demand in the Chinese market.” Despite the headwinds, analysts at Stifel believe an improvement for the company could arrive in H2 2025, driven by stimulus measures in China and a recovery in consumer sentiment. ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML) was one semiconductor stock that took a hit this week. On Tuesday, it declined over 15% as its latest earnings release disappointed investors. Following the report, which seemed to be released a day early in error, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald lowered the price target to EUR 750 from EUR1,000, removing it as a top pick. The firm did, however, maintain an Overweight rating on ASML. “This Q was obviously a disaster given order weakness and cut to the company’s CY25 outlook,” said the firm. “Near term, we view a likely bottom as €600 (25x new mid-point of 2025 target model) — and with shares at €633, we think the sell-off is mostly done. As for positive catalysts, it will take some time.”

Title: ‘Pointless meetings, middling middle managers’: Amazon employees air workplace complaints in viral LinkedIn post

Employee frustrations with Amazon’s culture, usually confined to internal forums, spilled into the public eye this week through a viral LinkedIn post that struck a chord with many current and former employees. Stephanie Ramos, a former Amazon employee, criticised the company’s growing bureaucracy in her post. "Instead of the exciting, fast-paced environment I remember, I experienced a place bogged down in pointless meetings and middling middle managers,” Ramos wrote, explaining why she quit just three months after being rehired. The post, shared on Monday, quickly gained traction. By the end of the week, it had attracted over 100,000 views and more than 200 comments. Around 20 commenters identified as current Amazon employees from various departments, many expressing similar frustrations. Some criticisms were directed at CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos in 2021. “Love him or hate him, Bezos had courage and a vision — he had real all-hands meetings that weren’t prerecorded with hard questions,” wrote Todd Leonhardt, an Amazon Web Services developer based in Virginia. Laura Barry, a nearly 20-year Amazon employee, compared the current work environment to that of a bank, citing the new policy requiring employees to return to the office five days a week. “I’m waiting for a dress code to be implemented after 5 days a week starts,” she joked. “Hide those tattoos!," as quoted by Bloomberg. While employee gripes are common at large companies, the public nature of this week’s LinkedIn discussions stood out. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan declined to comment on specific criticisms but noted that Amazon placed second in LinkedIn’s 2024 Top Companies list, trailing JPMorgan Chase, as per a report by Bloomberg. Jassy’s leadership has been marked by cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, which have pleased investors but upset some employees. In a September memo, Jassy himself criticized the company’s structure, saying that additional management layers had slowed progress. He argued that the five-day office return policy, starting in January 2024, would help restore Amazon’s fast-paced culture, the report added. Most employee backlash to the return-to-office mandate had previously remained on anonymous platforms like Blind. Ramos, however, decided to go public. Ramos, who worked at Amazon for six years before being laid off in 2023, was rehired earlier this year but left after finding the culture frustrating. Although she didn’t oppose the return-to-office requirement, the internal environment made her decide to quit, as per the report. Initially hesitant to post her thoughts, Ramos said she felt relieved when others responded to her post. "I’m not alone,” she said.

Title: Decoding Netflix Inc (NFLX): A Strategic SWOT Insight
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decoding-netflix-inc-nflx-strategic-050158579.html
Time Published: 2024-10-19T05:01:58Z

Netflix Inc showcases robust subscriber growth and revenue expansion. Strategic ad-supported plans introduced to tap into new revenue streams. Comprehensive SWOT analysis reveals key strengths and potential risks. Financial data indicates solid net income growth amidst competitive market. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), the leading streaming service provider, recently released its 10-Q filing on October 18, 2024, offering a detailed glimpse into its financial performance and strategic positioning. With a subscriber base surpassing 275 million globally, Netflix Inc has demonstrated significant growth, particularly in its net income, which rose to $2.36 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.68 million for the same period in the previous year. This financial overview sets the stage for a deeper SWOT analysis, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions. Global Subscriber Dominance: Netflix Inc's strength lies in its massive subscriber base, which is the largest among television entertainment providers worldwide. The company's consistent focus on expanding its content library with diverse genres and languages has contributed to its global appeal. This strategy has not only solidified its market dominance but also provided a substantial recurring revenue stream, as evidenced by the impressive growth in net income reported in the recent 10-Q filing. Financial Resilience: The financial tables from the 10-Q filing underscore Netflix Inc's robust financial health. The company's strong balance sheet is reflected in its increased net income and comprehensive income, indicating a resilient financial position that supports strategic investments and content development. This financial resilience provides Netflix Inc with the flexibility to navigate market fluctuations and invest in growth opportunities. Content Amortization Costs: Despite its financial strengths, Netflix Inc faces challenges with the high costs associated with content amortization. As the company invests heavily in acquiring, licensing, and producing content to maintain its competitive edge, these costs significantly impact its cost of revenues. The 10-Q filing reveals a $126 million increase in content amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the previous year, highlighting the need for efficient content cost management. Foreign Currency Exchange Risks: Netflix Inc's international presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange risks, which can affect its revenue and earnings. The 10-Q filing indicates that the company utilizes derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage these risks. However, the complexities of global financial markets mean that Netflix Inc must continuously refine its hedging strategies to mitigate potential adverse impacts on its financial performance. Ad-Supported Subscription Plans: The introduction of ad-supported subscription plans represents a significant opportunity for Netflix Inc to diversify its revenue streams. By tapping into the advertising market, the company can attract a broader audience base, particularly price-sensitive consumers, and generate additional income. This strategic move, as highlighted in the company description, aligns with industry trends and opens up new growth avenues for Netflix Inc. Content Innovation: Netflix Inc's commitment to content innovation presents opportunities to capture emerging market segments and trends. The company's investment in original programming, documentaries, and international content has the potential to attract new subscribers and retain existing ones. By continuously evolving its content offerings, Netflix Inc can maintain its market leadership and drive long-term subscriber growth. Intensifying Competition: The streaming industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Companies like Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Max are investing heavily in content and marketing, posing a threat to Netflix Inc's subscriber growth and retention. The 10-Q filing emphasizes the need for Netflix Inc to innovate and differentiate its service to stay ahead of the competition. Regulatory and Legal Challenges: Netflix Inc operates in a complex global regulatory environment, which can pose legal and compliance challenges. The company's expansion into new markets may be hindered by local regulations, content restrictions, and tax obligations. As indicated in the 10-Q filing, legal proceedings and non-income tax audits, particularly in jurisdictions like Brazil, could have material impacts on Netflix Inc's operations and financial position. In conclusion, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) displays a strong financial and strategic position, with a dominant global subscriber base and a solid balance sheet. However, the company must navigate the challenges of high content amortization costs and foreign currency exchange risks. Opportunities for growth lie in the newly introduced ad-supported plans and ongoing content innovation. Nevertheless, Netflix Inc must remain vigilant against the threats of intensifying competition and regulatory complexities. This SWOT analysis provides investors with a nuanced understanding of Netflix Inc's potential to sustain its leadership in the streaming industry while highlighting areas for strategic focus.

Title: ‘A period piece, a has-been, totally unknown to this generation’: Rediscovering WM Letts

With the surname Letts, it’s not surprising that diaries, letters and memoir form a major part of the literary estate of WM Letts. What is surprising is that the life story and works of this poet, war poet, dramatist, novelist, essayist and children’s writer have been almost forgotten, despite the recent interest in neglected female authors. Winifred Mabel Letts (1882-1972) was the granddaughter of Thomas Letts of Letts Diaries, and of Alexander James Ferrier of Ferrier Pollock & Co, a wholesale textile and haberdashery company whose headquarters were at Powerscourt Town House, off Grafton Street. Her father was Rev Ernest Letts, rector of Newton Heath in Manchester, who also used to officiate as summer chaplain at Holy Trinity Church on the Herberts’ Muckross Estate in Kerry. Her mother was Mary Isabel Ferrier, of Knockmaroon, just outside the gates of the Phoenix Park. It was to Knockmaroon – “to Paradise” – that the family came on holidays each year, to escape from their “smoke-blackened and rather grim” Lancashire parish. At the age of 16, Letts moved from a boarding school in the English midlands to Alexandra College in Dublin, where she studied English language and literature, French language and literature, history, geography and drawing. Following the death of her father in 1904, the family moved from Newton Heath to Blackrock, Co Dublin. The open spaces of Ireland and the open nature of Irish people seem to have released her creative spirit and, for the next 60 years, newspapers, periodicals, publishers and broadcasters regularly featured Letts’s writings – poems, short stories, essays, children’s books, plays, reviews and, in the case of The Irish Times, her letters to the editor. Letts’s first visit to the Abbey Theatre – “a daring move” as the Abbey was regarded suspiciously by her own unionist Protestant circle – was to see Synge’s Riders to the Sea in January 1907. It inspired her to write and submit a play of her own, The Eyes of the Blind, which was accepted and first performed on Easter Monday, along with Yeats’ Deirdre and Lady Gregory’s Spreading the News and The Rising of the Moon. In October 1909, her play, The Challenge, was performed, and thus Letts, as well as being only the second female playwright to have a play performed in the Abbey, is one of the few women – to date – to have had more than one play performed there. Other plays and sketches were broadcast on radio and performed by amateur groups, and a three-act documentary play, Hamilton and Jones, was staged in the Gate Theatre in July 1941. [ What do Irish writers read? Donal Ryan, Mark Tighe, Nuala O’Connor, Claire Hennessy and more give recommendationsOpens in new window ] Letts said, when interviewed in 1969 by Maeve Binchy for The Irish Times’s Women First series, that she never heard anything “memorable or musical” in drawingroom conversation and that all her ideas came “from the back door”, from listening to the talk of people “who came to sell things or to deliver vegetables”. A conversation with a blackberry seller from Glencullen led to the poem, Thim that Thravels on their Feet, which was published in the Spectator in 1910. Letts was then asked to write a cycle of poems which CV Stanford could set to music for Harry Plunket Greene to sing. Many of her best-known poems, including A Soft Day, Tim, An Irish Terrier, and The Bold Unbiddable Child, were published in her first collection of poetry, Songs from Leinster (1913). The two Stanford cycles, A Fire of Turf and A Sheaf of Songs from Leinster, were taken from this collection, and were performed as recently as March 2024 in the National Concert Hall as part of the Stanford Centenary Series. A second and third collection of lyrical poetry followed in 1926 and 1947. Letts was asked to write a cycle of poems which CV Stanford could set to music for Harry Plunket Greene to sing Letts’s work during the first World War as a nursing voluntary aid detachment in Manchester, followed by her training in Baggot Street Hospital as a masseuse (nowadays called a physiotherapist), resulted in her groundbreaking war poetry, published prior to the collections of Sassoon, Owen and Ledwidge. Her early war poems celebrated the young men going off to war, even though they leave their heartbroken families behind. But as the war progressed, Letts exposed the physical trauma, and the barely acknowledged problems of mental trauma, in poems such as To a Soldier in Hospital and What Reward? Her empathy with, and sympathy for, the young soldier who “could not face the German guns” in her poem, The Deserter, makes this one of the most moving of all war poems. The collections, Hallow-e’en and Poems of the War and The Spires of Oxford and Other Poems, were published in 1916 and 1917. As well as writing poetry and drama, essays and short stories, Letts wrote six children’s books (five of which were serialised and broadcast on radio), three books on religious themes, a memoir (Knockmaroon) and seven novels directed at an audience of young women experiencing the freedom brought about by education and employment opportunities. Her verses were used by Elizabeth C Yeats in her Cuala Press prints and cards. A copy of the Cuala Press print St Brigid, with verse by Letts, and illustrated by her stepdaughter, Kathleen Verschoyle, now hangs in Government Buildings. Letts continued her professional work as a masseuse up to the time of her marriage in 1926 to William HF Verschoyle, a widower 23 years older than her, who had lost two of his three sons in the first World War. Letts initially found it difficult to adapt to living in town, at 19 Fitzwilliam Square, but she loved her time on the Verschoyle farmlands in Kilberry, Co Kildare. She relished the company of her step-grandson, her great-nieces, her many godchildren, and the children of those who worked for them. Life was busy with her involvement in the Women Writers’ Club, PEN, Wild Flower Society, and many charities, including the Dublin Auxiliary of the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (DSPCA), to whom she donated royalties and poems, when it was in financial difficulties. [ Sam Thompson: ‘I really don’t think there is a distinction to be made between writing for adults and writing for children’Opens in new window ] After the death of her husband, Letts moved to Kent in 1947 to live with her sisters. She returned permanently to Ireland in 1953, and bought the charming Beech Cottage on Ballinclea Road, Killiney. Fifty years after her death in 1972, President Michael D Higgins attended a ceremony in Rathcoole Church of Ireland marking the addition of her name to the Verschoyle headstone. In a 1957 interview in The Irish Times, Letts described herself as “a period piece, a has-been, totally unknown to this generation”. Two generations later, Letts is, at last, being recognised and remembered – as a groundbreaking poet, an innovative dramatist, an engaging novelist and a talented children’s author. Sing in the Quiet Places of my Heart, a biography of Letts by Bairbre O’Hogan, is published by South Dublin Libraries.

Title: GAA county final previews: Kilmacud-Crokes bidding for four-in-a-row in Dublin

Full Content:
Westmeath SFC final replay: St Loman’s v The Downs, TEG Cusack Park, 3.0 – There was nothing between them in the drawn match, a contest that went back and forth but Loman’s maybe have a little more room for improvement. Verdict: St Loman’s Leitrim SHC final: Carrick Hurling Club v Cluainín Iomáint, Drumshambo, 2.0. Armagh SFC final: Clann Éireann v Clan na Gael, Athletic Grounds, 4.15 – Clann Éireann beat champions Crossmaglen in the semi-final, as they did in the 2021 final when winning their most recent title. That recent pedigree makes them favourites with Armagh All-Ireland winners spread through the field from Barry McCambridge at the back to Conor Turbitt up front. Clan na Gael’s in-form Shane McPartlan and county super sub, Stefan Campbell will ensure it’s not easy but it’s hard to see an upset. Verdict: Clann Éireann Cavan SFC final: Crosserlough v Ramor United, Kingspan Breffini, 4.0 – Crosserlough have impressed on the way to the final, especially in the absence of injured star forward Paddy Lynch. An experienced Ramor will be formidable opponents and can spring a surprise. Verdict: Ramor United. Fermanagh SFC final: Enniskillen Gaels v Erne Gaels, Brewster Park, 2.0 – Former Donegal manager Declan Bonner is in charge of Erne Gaels’ quest for a first title in 43 years and they overcame champions and regular tormentors Derrygonnelly in the semi-final. Enniskillen, champions from two years ago, stand in the way. Verdict: Enniskillen Gaels Dublin SFC final: Cuala v Kilmacud Crokes, Parnell Park, 2.30 [Live, TG4] – Kilmacud, on the trail of a fourth straight title, are hot favourites against their southside neighbours, whose only previous final was in 1988. There have been slight signs of weariness in Crokes but in the past they have always perked up at the right time. Cuala may have the edge at centrefield with Peadar Ó Cofaigh Byrne and Cillian Dunne, brother of county women’s star Jennifer, in fine form. The Dalkey side are 100 per cent for the championship to date – Crokes drew along the way – and Con O’Callaghan has been a consistent menace. What may decide the outcome is the polished Kilmacud defence, which can restrict their opponents’ high-scoring attack and leave an attainable target for Paul Mannion and company at the other end. Verdict: Kilmacud Crokes London SFC final: St Kiernan’s v North London Shamrocks, Ruislip, 2.30. Louth SFC final: Naomh Mairtín v St Mary’s, Haggardstown, 3.30 – St Mary’s are on three-in-a-row and face the team they beat in last year’s final. Despite some indifferent form along the way, they can keep the title in Ardee. Verdict: St Mary’s Longford SFC final replay: Abbeylara v Colmcille, Glennon Brothers Pearse Park, 4.0 – Abbeylara may have missed their chance last week against the experienced former champions. Verdict: Colmcille Mayo SFC final: Ballina Stephenites v Knockmore – Postponed due to the Met Éireann status orange wind warning that has been issued for Mayo. Game will now be played next Saturday, October 26th. Meath SFC final: Dunshaughlin v Wolfe Tones, Páirc Tailteann, 3.0 – A clash between the experience of Wolfe Tones and a rising Dunshaughlin, just a couple of seasons out of intermediate. Managed by Richie Kealy and coached by former Dublin All-Ireland winner Paul Curran, who has returned to his Dunshaughlin roots, the club his father Noel played for when winning an All-Ireland with Meath in 1967. Verdict: Dunshaughlin Roscommon SFC final: Pádraig Pearses v Roscommon Gaels, Dr Hyde Park, 2.0 – Pearses caused a big shock when eliminating St Brigid’s, the Connacht champions, who were unlucky not to win last season’s All-Ireland. Former provincial winners themselves, they are unlikely to let it slip against an emerging but still callow Gaels team. Verdict: Pádraig Pearses Tipperary SFC final: Clonmel Commercials v Loughmore-Castleiney, Semple Stadium, 4.0 – The great dual story of Loughmore continues and both their form in walloping the fancied Moyle Rovers and their momentum as hurling champions gives them a great chance against the formidable Commercials, who are on a three-in-a-row. Verdict: Loughmore-Castleiney Tyrone SFC final: Errigal Ciarán v Trillick, Healy Park, 4.0 – Trillick came out winners in this same fixture a year ago after a thrilling final in which they deposed the then champions. There’s not much in it again but spurred by last year’s reverse, Errigal Ciarán can settle accounts with the champions. Verdict: Errigal Ciarán Waterford SFC final: Ballinacourty v Rathgormack, Fraher Field Dungarvan, 3.0 – Rathgormack annihilated The Nire in the semi-final and are well fancied not to relent in the final against Ballinacourty who will be sterner opponents after a narrow win over Gaultier. Verdict: Rathgormack Wicklow SFC final: Baltinglass v Tinahely, Aughrim, 2.0 – Precedent is against Tinahely, who lost their more recent final to this weekend’s opponents four years ago and were also beaten when the teams met earlier in this season’s championship. Verdict: Baltinglass Antrim SHC final: Dunloy v Ruairi Óg Cushendall, Ballycastle, 2.0 – Conal Cunning’s injury is a major blow for Dunloy, who had an impressive semi-final win over Loughgiel and were on course to reclaim the Antrim title. It’s more complicated now. Verdict: Cushendall Clare SHC final: Sixmilebridge v Feakle – Postponed due to the Met Éireann status orange wind warning that was issued for Clare on Saturday. Game provisionally scheduled for bank holiday Monday, October 28th. Cork SHC final: Imokilly v Sarsfields, Páirc Uí Chaoimh, TG4, 4.15 – A tight, tight extra-time win for Sarsfields was the outcome when the teams met in last year’s semi-final, which should ostensibly give a motivational edge to Imokilly against the champions who again had a tough semi-final this time against Midleton and did well to survive. That may have renewed them for the final after an undemanding earlier season whereas Imokilly were comfortable winners against Blackrock. Séamus Harnedy has maintained his strong Cork form for the challengers as has Ciarán Joyce. Verdict: Imokilly Derry SHC final: Slaughtneil v Banagher, Owenbeg, 4.0 – Banagher approach with hopes high but it’s hard to argue with a team looking for a 12th successive title. Verdict: Slaughtneil Down SHC final: Ballygalget v St Patrick’s, Páirc Esler, 4.0.

Defending champions Kilcormac have been in exceptional form this season and even though Ballinamere are clearly on the rise, the breakthrough may have to wait.

Title: Des Cahill having the time of his life as Cuala’s footballers finally get their day in the sun

Cuala are in the Dublin football final for only the second time in their history, so what do you do? You get on to Des Cahill. And you ask Des Cahill who in Cuala should you be talking to about the club’s football story. You’d like, if possible, to hear from somebody who was around for all the bad times. A person who, while being delighted for the hurlers throughout their All-Ireland-winning success in the late-2010s, still flew the flag for the football side of the house. A Cuala big ball lifer. Des Cahill thinks about it for half an hour and replies by suggesting ... Des Cahill. “In terms of this team ... that’s probably me!” reads the WhatsApp reply. “I was with them since we won the Under-21 title 14 years ago until 2 years ago. Ironically the Under 21 win – against the odds – was against Crokes ... on my 50th birthday. A day of days!” And so here we are, a few afternoons later, walking down through the village of Glasthule with red and white flags hanging from every lamp-post. Keep going and you’ll arrive on to Main Street in Dalkey, where it’s impossible to go 10 yards without seeing some sign of the county final. This part of Dublin’s southside knows plenty about success in rugby and in hurling too. But a county football final? Not in this neighbourhood. “The joy of it is brilliant,” Cahill says. “We’re probably getting more joy out of it than most teams, I’d imagine. People say, ‘Oh Cuala, sure you won two All-Irelands’. Fantastic. And it really was, everyone was so happy for the hurlers. But for the likes of me now, this justifies years and years of sticking at it.” Cuala is a flipside club in Dublin. In most cases, being a dual club means one of two realities – you’re either stubbornly 50/50 or you’re a football club with a hurling section fighting its corner. In Cuala, it’s always been the other way around. Not outwardly, not officially – but everyone knows what’s what. Cahill tells a story about Vinny Holden, brother of Mick, son of Cuala founding father Tommy. Holden hurled for Dublin for 20 years and was a mainstay of the first Cuala teams to win senior Dublin titles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Spin the tape on and he and Cahill were in cahoots the day after the minor footballers won their first county championship in 2006. [ ‘We’re a long time on the road’: Michael Fitzsimons ready to tick senior club title off the list with CualaOpens in new window ] “Mick Fitzsimons was in that group,” Cahill remembers. “But you had Paul Schutte there, David Treacy, Oisin Gough – all those lads who went on to hurl for Dublin. We beat Vincent’s in the final and we were elated. For us owl’ lads, beating Vincent’s was huge. The young lads didn’t think that was a big deal but it was for us. “Anyway, we were all out after it and it went late and sure then we all had to ring home to explain where we were. And Vinnie rang his wife Marion and went, ‘Marion, you know the minor hurlers? They’re after winning the football championship!’ “They weren’t even called the minor footballers. So that sort of sums up Cuala for me, when people ask are we a hurling club or a football club.” Over the past four decades, Cahill has been the club’s best known member, give or take Con O’Callaghan. When Cuala reached their only Dublin football final away back in July 1988, he was out of the country on a summer-long work adventure that took in Euro 88, the Tour de France and the Seoul Olympics. He has waited 36 years for them to get back here. [ My Club: Des Cahill on Cuala Opens in new window ] For long stretches of Cuala’s footballing life, they have lived in the shadow of bigger concerns. That goes for their own club, where hurling has reigned. But it goes too for the schoolyard world of southside Dublin GAA, where Kilmacud Crokes have always been the biggest boys in the flashiest kits. “We would have resented Kilmacud years ago for being the big ogres and us being the small guys,” Cahill says. “We had a fellah, John O’Callaghan, who was a sub on the Dublin 1995 team that beat Tyrone to win the All-Ireland. He’s a great lad. “But Dublin said to him, ‘You can’t be playing intermediate, you need to be playing senior’. And he came to us and said, ‘Lads, do you mind if I go to Kilmacud?’ And we were going, ‘Eh, obviously!’ But we were only messing – no one minded because he was a great lad and you were happy to see him do well. But that’s who we were, basically.” As time went on and the GAA took more of a hold around the area, Cuala were never short of talent and certainly haven’t struggled for numbers. Eventually, that translated into an unprecedented level of hurling success. Five Dublin titles in six seasons between 2015 and 2020. Back-to-back Leinster and All-Ireland champions. A golden time. In a way, it all started in 2009. The backbone of those teams came from the side that won the under-21 hurling championship in Dublin 15 years ago. What got lost along the way though is the fact Cuala did the under-21 double in 2009 and that a huge chunk of them were on the football team as well. “That under-21 final was the start of this team,” Cahill says. “The final was just before Christmas and we beat Kilmacud against the odds. On the back of that, we had a lot of promise going forward. But the hurling took over. “I’m convinced, with the talent on that team, that we could have had great success in football. The lads on that team were really good underage footballers. Paul Schutte was at least two years as a Dublin minor footballer as a full-forward. Oisín Gough and the Treacys were good underage footballers. “But Anthony Daly took them in straight away and didn’t want them playing football. We won the Dublin intermediate championship one year and we were going into Leinster. But they were going in training with Dublin in November. And I’m friends with Daly and I was going, ‘Dalo, come on’. But he was trying to make his mark as well and he was just going, ‘Des, they have to put in the work now to be ready for next summer’. “So I lost out there. They went for Dublin, which was fair enough. We had seven in the Dublin squad at one stage. Then Matty [Kenny] came along as senior hurling manager in the club. And Matty was going, ‘This group has huge potential’. The first year or two, we didn’t do anything in the hurling. But he said, ‘You cannot be hurling only every second week. You’ve no chance’. “And he was a very good salesman to the lads. He said: ‘You have to hurl every week if you’re going to do anything in the championship’. And he did that – and he was right! I thought at the time that we could win the football and the hurling in Dublin but he was right and I was wrong. We wouldn’t have won an All-Ireland in hurling if the lads had all played football as well.” If it was anything, it was a first-world problem. Cuala were winning All-Irelands in hurling and the name of the club was going far and wide. The footballers chipped away with what they had – and when Con O’Callaghan came along, what they had was enough to keep them in or around the top ranks. Peadar Ó Cofaigh-Byrne arrived, big and broad and taking no nonsense from anyone. Plenty more as well. “We had James Power, who was a very good rugby player. He’s the oldest by a long way. Him and Mick Fitz and Luke Keating have been there all the way. Power is 37 or so now, he’s kind of a posh boy, you know? A good Blackrock boy. “He called the referee ‘Sir’ once! And everyone, including the referee, thought he was taking the piss. The opposition were laughing. But no one messes with him. He’s also the most physical player we have, he’s our toughest, hardest player as well. But yeah, he called the referee ‘Sir’ in a game and Jesus Christ the ref turned against us completely. “For the likes of him and Luke Keating, this is so great. Luke would have made those hurling teams but he chose to stay with the football. And I felt so guilty. For those lads to be in a county final now, it’s great. It’s just brilliant.” Cuala will travel across Dublin Bay in style, naturally. They will march through the village en masse on Sunday afternoon and climb aboard the DART they’ve hired for the occasion. It will leave Dalkey station and go directly to Killester – very pointedly not stopping in Blackrock or Seapoint or any of the other necklace of stations from which rogue Kilmacud Crokes might sneak aboard. Then they will march on Parnell Park, a football day of days finally upon them. And though they are underdogs and though they face a Crokes team going for four-in-a-row, they won’t be put off by the odds being stacked against them. Why would they? It’s all they know. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Gold topped $2,700 an ounce for the first time as concerns over escalating conflicts in the Middle East and a tight US election race prompt investors to flock to safety. Bullion climbed as much as 1% to $2,720.17 an ounce, beating the all-time high set in the previous session. The bullish sentiment spilled over to the wider precious metals complex, with silver jumping as much as 5.5% to the highest since 2012. BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Silver Trust, the largest exchange-traded product tracking the metal, saw a large increase of call options as investors bet on higher prices. Markets are focused on increasingly fraught geopolitical developments after Israel said it killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the Palestinian group’s attack on southern Israel that triggered a yearlong war in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would keep fighting until all the hostages captured by Hamas last year are free, even as US President Joe Biden said it was time for the war to end. Investors typically seek safety in gold in times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Investors were also repositioning portfolios ahead of the US election on Nov. 5. “Traditional polls and decentralized betting polls have diverged significantly, even as we get closer to elections,” said Christopher Wong, FX strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “Trump hedges — long gold — may still gather traction given the fluidity of election developments and geopolitical uncertainties.” Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2%, snapping a four-day rally. A weaker greenback makes bullion cheaper for many buyers, as it is priced in the US currency. Gold is about 2.4% higher for the week, with haven demand outweighing other macro headwinds that would normally weigh on the precious metal after US reports on Thursday diminished bets on the scale of Federal Reserve easing. Bullion is one of 2024’s strongest performing commodities, with gains of more than 30% so far this year. Rate-cut optimism fueled the most recent gains as the Fed kicked off its easing cycle last month. Robust central bank buying has also been a long-standing pillar of support for gold prices. Read More: Gold Investors See Gains in Rate-Cut Era From ETFs, Haven Buying Western investors have also helped drive prices higher, after largely remaining on the sidelines in the first half of the year as Asian demand surged. The US central bank’s pivot to looser monetary policy has bolstered the appeal of exchange-traded funds backed by bullion, with holdings on course for a fifth monthly expansion in October — the longest run of inflows since 2020. For many in the industry, the outlook from here is even more bullish. Traders, refiners and miners who attended the London Bullion Market Association’s annual gathering this week saw prices rising to about $2,917 an ounce by late October 2025, according to the average forecast from a survey of delegates. Silver will gain more than 40% in the coming year to reach $45 an ounce, according to the survey. Spot gold was trading at $2,718.72 an ounce as of 2:36 p.m. in New York.

(Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has granted "accelerated approval" to 11 exchange-traded funds to list and trade options tied to spot bitcoin prices on the New York Stock Exchange, according to a regulatory filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in January approved the bitcoin ETFs to track bitcoin, in what was a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF are among funds that received the approval on Friday. The index options - listed derivatives offering a quick and inexpensive way to amplify exposure to bitcoin - on a bitcoin index would give institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Options are listed derivatives that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset, such as a stock or exchange-traded product, at a predetermined price by a set date. The regulator last month approved listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s, exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq.

This is this week’s ForbesWomen newsletter, which every Thursday brings news about the world’s top female entrepreneurs, leaders and investors straight to your inbox. Click here to get on the newsletter list! US President Barack Obama applauds Lilly Ledbetter before signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, January 29, 2009. The wage discrimination bill, which allows employees more time to file a claim, is named after Lilly Ledbetter, a retired worker at a Goodyear factory in Alabama who discovered she was paid less than her male counterparts. AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) On Saturday, groundbreaking pay equity advocate Lilly Ledbetter passed away at the age of 86. Ledbetter never set out to be an activist—she was a factory worker in Alabama who just wanted to do her job and get paid fairly for doing it. But after an anonymous note informed Ledbetter that she was being paid significantly less than all 15 of her male colleagues, including those with less seniority, Ledbetter set out on a path that would ultimately lead to a change in American law. “It’s important to remember that she was a manager in a tire plant in Alabama in the 80s. She was a force in the workplace, a woman ahead of her time,” Noreen Farrell, the executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, told me in an interview this week. While it’s hard to calculate the exact number of people who’ve benefited from the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act—which President Obama signed in his first act as commander in chief in 2009—Farrell says that Ledbetter’s work touches tens of thousands of pay discrimination cases every year. However, as entrepreneur LIz Elting notes in her remembrance of Ledbetter for ForbesWomen, the future Ledbetter fought for may still be on uncertain ground, with recent research from the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) estimating that the gender pay gap may never close. “So many women, this writer included, have Ledbetter to thank for igniting this fight so that we can one day make that future a reality,” Elting says. “In her own words, ‘This fight, which began as my own, is now our fight.’” Cheers to that!

There’s a common stereotype in the modern working world that women are less confident than men. It’s sometimes used to excuse gender and pay disparities at the leadership level. But new research suggests that the opposite is true: in 2024, female business leaders are significantly more confident that they have the right skills to be successful at work than their male counterparts. 1.

Title: BlackRock eyes crypto derivatives market with BUIDL as collateral

The move could boost significantly the nearly $550 million market cap presented by BUIDL, the largest tokenized US treasuries fund. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is reportedly in discussions with several centralized exchanges to allow its BUIDL fund to be used as collateral for derivatives trades As reported by Bloomberg on Oct. 18, people familiar with the matter shared that the move includes exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit. This move is part of a broader push by Wall Street firms to deepen their involvement in the digital asset markets. BlackRock’s BUIDL token requires a minimum investment of $5 million and is specifically designed for qualified institutional investors. FalconX and Hidden Road, two major crypto prime brokers, already permit their hedge fund clients to use BUIDL as collateral, while custodian Komainu recently announced its clients would be able to trade via Hidden Road using the token as collateral. Direct acceptance of BUIDL on platforms like Binance and Deribit would significantly increase its market reach. The crypto derivatives market moved nearly $3.5 trillion in September, which is almost four times larger than the spot market, according to data from Coinglass and The Block. While BlackRock has yet to comment on the initiative, Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers acknowledged that the exchange is considering various tokens, including BUIDL. However, Strijers stressed the need for regulatory approvals and a deeper understanding of the token’s technical aspects before moving forward. The report of the world’s largest asset manager moving deeper into crypto coincides with another report about a crypto-native company delving into traditional finance. Tether Limited, the issuer of the Tether USD (USDT) stablecoin, is reportedly considering offering lending to commodities trading companies. The move is a possible alternative the crypto firm found to leverage its $5.2 billion profit registered in the first half. Moreover, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are already considering using BUIDL tokenized shares in financial instruments. On Aug. 26, leading money market platform Aave proposed a new GHO Stability Module (GSM) based on BlackRock’s tokenized fund. GSM is a mechanism created by Aave to help maintain the peg of its ecosystem’s stablecoin, GHO. When users swap USD Coin (USDC) for GHO, the novel module would allow the exchange of USDC for BUIDL. According to the proposal, this would help GHO’s stability while providing value accrual to users through BlackRock’s offered yield. Moreover, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs revealed a new stablecoin fully backed by BUIDL on Sept. 26. The UStb would offer an alternative to Ethena’s USDe, appealing to users with a more conservative appetite for risk.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Netflix Leads Index Higher After Earnings Beat

Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher on the final day of a trading week that included a series of earnings reports from key companies. After major financial firms disclosed mostly upbeat results earlier in the week, Netflix (NFLX) took the spotlight with a strong report that could be a positive signal for the tech and communications giants set to report in the coming weeks. On Friday, the S&P 500 added 0.4% to notch an all-time closing high. The Dow reversed morning losses to end the session nearly 0.1% higher, extending its streak of record closes to three. The Nasdaq was up 0.6%. Netflix shares scored the S&P 500's top daily performance, soaring 11.1% to an all-time high following the video-streaming giant's better-than-expected third-quarter financial results. Although the pace of subscriber additions slowed from the preceding quarters, 14% growth in total active subscribers was enough to edge out estimates. Analysts have indicated that the company's crackdown on password-sharing has helped boost subscriber numbers, but Netflix plans to discontinue the public release of subscriber data starting in 2025. Shares of Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) surged 10.2% after a securities filing confirmed reports that activist investor Jana Partners has acquired a stake of around 5% in the food processing company. Jana reportedly intends to encourage the maker of frozen french fries to consider the possibility of a sale as well as push for changes to its operations and capital allocation strategy. An upbeat earnings report also helped lift shares of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), which jumped 10% after the provider of robotic-assisted systems for minimally invasive medical procedures topped quarterly sales and profit estimates. The company disclosed an 18% uptick in the number of procedures performed using its da Vinci surgical system. In the wake of the strong results, analysts at Piper Sandler lifted their price target on Intuitive Surgical stock to $538 from $495. Agricultural stocks moved lower after Raymond James downgraded Canada-based grain processor Ag Growth International (AGGZF) to "market perform." Analysts said soft crop prices and weak sentiment among farmers amounted to significant headwinds for the global agricultural industry. Shares of fellow grain handler Bunge Global (BG) dropped 6.3%, the steepest decline in the S&P 500 Friday, while peer Archer-Daniels-Midland's (ADM) shares slide 3.8%. Ag Growth International's American depositary receipts (ADRs) were down 10.7%. CVS Health (CVS) shares tumbled 5.2% following the announcement that the pharmacy giant is replacing its chief executive officer (CEO). Company veteran David Joyner, most recently in charge of the firm's pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), Caremark, is stepping into the top role, effective immediately. CVS also issued a lower-than-expected outlook for its third-quarter profit. The company is set to release its next quarterly results before the opening bell on Nov. 6. SLB (SLB), the world's largest oilfield services company, reported mixed third-quarter results, topping profit expectations but falling short of revenue forecasts. The company, formerly known as Schlumberger, cautioned that depressed spending by oil producers in the context of a weak oil price environment could restrain its fourth-quarter revenue growth. SLB shares lost 4.7% on Friday.

Title: The Philosophy of Investing

ERIC KIM Ultimately when people study Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger etc ,,, what all these guys are searching for is wisdom. I think this is good and important because principles wisdom, is resistant to time and technology, but at least for myself, I was born in 1988, searching for practical wisdom has always remained elusive for me. I think difficult thing is that my circumstances were unique. I was born in the states, yet grew up poor; my definition of poor is not being sure whether you would be homeless next month because your dad just gambled away the rent money again, going off to Reno in the middle of the night. I think on two fronts this was useful to me: First, it taught me self independence at a very young age. I knew that if I wanted anything, I had to work for it. This motivated me to pick up lots of part-time jobs when I was like 13, 14 or 15, tutoring English, through my honors program at school, working at the local community center, getting a $200 a month stipend etc. ￼ In fact, my biggest personal pride and joy; essentially, purchasing my first car with my own money! At the age of 15, getting my drivers permit in California, $1000 or maybe $1200 1991 Sentra XE, 5 door sedan, 5 speed manual transmission car — it didn’t even have a tachometer! I learned how to shift gears simply by hearing and feeling the engine? This began my first love affair with manual transmission cars; In fact, another point of pride, every car I have purchased my own money has always been a used manual transmission car, never exceeding $2500 USD. In fact, the last car I purchased one in Providence Rhode Island before Seneca was born was a 2002 Subaru outback, five speed manual transmission, listed on craigslist for 1000 bucks, was able to negotiate down to $900, then $800 in cash! Lying out those eight $100 bills was the most obvious decision I’ve made in my life. ￼￼In terms of my decision-making philosophy, my unorthodox beliefs; obvious decisions are obvious. ￼ What that means is before making any sort of decision life decision etc., you don’t need to think about it too much. Obvious decisions are staring you right at the face, and whenever you have to hesitate before making a certain decision, don’t do it. Why? Your brain is still working out the details, whether or not you should do the thing or not. For example, buying microstrategy stock, MSTR, ￼￼to me is a 100% obvious decision. For the traditional markets, it’s literally the only asset worth purchasing. Why? Essentially they have discovered a free money hack or infinite money hack, which they could leverage their 30-year-old business, which is regulated, and mainstream… And leverage their position, borrowing money at less than one percent to buy bitcoin, which is accretive forever, and continuing the virtuous cycle. Bitcoin is cyber manhattan: 256^3￼ I think the idea of a cyber Manhattan, cyber real estate company is fascinating to me. And the difference between bitcoin, cyber real estate and Cyberman Manhattan is that it is actually backed by real electricity and power. For example, the problems with all these fake virtual worlds is that it is just powered by a computer code, one and zeros, Any nerd can click a button and create a skyscraper in Sim city. But what if, if you wanted to build a skyscraper in Sim city, you actually had to expand $1 billion of real capital in the real world, before transferring it and transporting it to cyberspace? This is the 1000% paradigm shift; The bridge between the physical, embodied reality, ￼ physical world and realm, to the digital cyber realm… Which is still backed with physical electricity? Or it’s a feature, not a bug? I think what a lot of these goody two shoers don’t get or understand is about real life physics in the game, skin in the game, energy in the game. Everyone wants some sort of hidden upside without any real life downside? I’ll give you example, everyone wants to rid the world of suffering pain injustice and the like. However, a life without suffering pain injustice and overcoming is not a life worth living. You cannot have happiness without pain and suffering, nor can you have joy with without sorrow and misery. If we think about this from a Taoist perspective, ￼I think about yin and Yang, you cannot have the good without the bad. You cannot have the virtuous without the evil. For example, obviously being in poor health sucks, and bad weather also sucks. But, when things get much better, you are 1000 times more joyful grateful and happy when things shift! This is why funny enough, I think people on the East Coast, New England, Providence Rhode Island are happier than people in LA because the weather shifts are more extreme. For example, when you’re suffering in the winter time for months on end, no sunshine whatever, and then boom, one day the sun comes out, everyone is overjoyed! It is still 55° and cold, but at least it is sunny; everyone runs out and gets their picnic blankets, And the joy of the sunlight is 1000 times more extreme than in Los Angeles where everyone is trying to hide from the sun, even though they love it? My simple analogy is everyone in LA is like a solid 7.2 out of 10, in terms of happiness, whereas in the East coast, your happiness goes from a -10 to a +500% when the weather is good! ￼ So I suppose, the philosophical question them becomes, is it better or more favorable to have a steady mediocre thing forever, or more extreme highs and lows, which will be a benefit to your happiness? Then a simple thought, the reason why I love bitcoin is because of the extremes; I would prefer an extreme life to a steady and boring one. ￼ I think for me my number one principle in investing ￼￼is yield. I think what a lot of people think is what they’re trying to do with their money is they are trying to securitize it, and make it safe, stored in really really safe assets like treasury bills, bonds, or “safe” investments like Apple Amazon Facebook Google and like. But, my personal thought is life should not be conservative; the point of life isn’t to just conserve your wealth, but rather, to grow it! Even the story of Jesus, you don’t just take your wealth and hide it and bury your talents, your gold talents in the ground because you’re afraid of losing it. No, the virtuous thing is to go out and multiply it! And I also think the same thing is with wealth; the virtuous calling is to multiply it to grow it, not to just bury it, with the fear that it might go down. OK, a lot of these fools, they want quick gains in order to go out and buy the Lamborghini or whatever. But once you find out that only small dick losers drive Lamborghinis, ￼ and also, that the useful lifetime value of a Lamborghini might only be three or four years, that is the point in which the maintenance costs and the insurance costs and fixing it up will destroy the price of it in just three or four years, then it becomes obvious; you wish the Lamborghini onto your worst enemy, you don’t desire one for yourself. ￼ My simple thought is take a stoic spartan approach; essentially live like a super super poor person, the only thing you should ever spend money on is weights barbells and weightlifting equipment, and meet… Everything else should be essentially free. This means, Essentially, the easiest way to become rich is not go broke.￼ So essentially, I’ve literally I think watch every single Michael Saylor interview that he’s ever done everything that he posted to Twitter or YouTube etc. Maybe about 100 of them. Anyways, probably the most fascinating thing that I’ve learned about the value of an asset is the value of an asset is essentially the cost of something or the value is something divided by the maintenance cost. Now I think this is something that people don’t really think about — ￼the maintenance cost. So for example, now that all of my millennial friends are growing up, I’m 36 now, in four years, I’m gonna be 40 years old, everyone’s trying to think about the future buying a single-family home or a condo or property or whatever. And what beguiles a lot of people or shocks people is when they buy a house, all the maintenance costs! Even talking to my friend Anton (congrats on your new kid!) he told me a story while we were in downtown LA about how he bought a house, but the water heater went out, and him having to fix it, and what a nightmare it was. Also simple things that we millennials never think about… You need a new roof and boom, that’s $50,000. That’s $50,000 I would rather put into bitcoin. There are so many things that exist on the planet, in real world, in embody reality which cost a premium in terms of insurance, maintenance, etc. Once again, almost nothing in the physical realm is ever worth it. ￼ If you want a new car, just download some racing game to your iPad, or even PlayStation or whatever; better to spend 50 bucks on a virtual car then drop $50,000 or more on a new one!￼ ￼ Or, just buy an oculus quest, play some racing game, at least this way you want to kill yourself, or another family in a car with two kids or more. –> The worst thing in life isn’t dying or killing yourself, but it is accidentally killing another family, accidentally killing kids in the car seat of another car, and you having to live with the guilt for the rest of your life. ￼￼ Bitcoin is not real, but, if it costs $800 billion to produce, it’s real! Let’s again, things must have a stake in the physical realm, if it doesn’t, it is just air coin, or the foundation is just built on cotton candy. I think we must avoid these fake environmentalists, a bunch of vegan losers. Essentially, if I psychoanalyze a lot of these fake environmentalists; essentially everyone is seeking a new religion, a new godhead which is the “environment“, but ultimately my critical thought is that once again it just comes down to money; For example, Al Gore, I wonder… How much money has he collected from doing his talks on an inconvenient truth, ultimately being funded by taxpayer money? And also, James Cameron, and also Arnold, how much money they have collected from the vegan pea protein powder plant factory, just follow the money. ￼ Much more profitable to sell a $50 container of vegan protein powder, than a meat company to sell beef rib or beef liver. ￼ Also a random aside; if you really wanted to be a real environmentalist, you would actually have a 100% organ meat diet, only beef heart beef liver beef kidneys and intestines, because these parts are typically thrown away. “Being naked is the ultimate sustainable option. We’re number two.” – Reformation marketing copy ￼ The truth is environmentalism is very profitable. For example a lot of these clothing companies, I think also like the new one “Reformation“, a female clothing company, they talk about sustainability and blah blah blah, but once again, is it just another marketing tactic to sell their mediocre clothes. For example, people talk that leather in animal products are evil blah blah blah. Yet the truth is, you’re cheap vegan leather jacket which is made out of petroleum is probably 1 trillion times worse for the planet than a fashionable one made out of 100% real leather. A pleather vegan jacket might only last you a few years, a good leather jacket can you last you 50 or beyond.￼ Because if you critically think about it, things which last, are better for the “environment”. And typically animal products last. I love leather!￼ Also nowadays, people talk about Native Americans and stuff like that, don’t you know that historically the way that natives lived off the land was in harmony with animals, like can you imagine a Native American who didn’t use animal power, ride on horses, or eat meat and bison? Besides maybe virtue signaling America, ￼there is no great civilization that has ever existed without animal products whether food labor etc. ￼ Once again I think the biggest issue is in today’s world, nobody likes risk anymore. Risk is seen as something which is dangerous bad and to be avoided. For example anybody who buys a Mercedes car an Audi, a Porsche a Lamborghini whatever… It is ultimately a risk free option in the sense that no one’s gonna make fun of you for owning those type of cars. So in some ways it is a cowardly act; For example everyone thinks a Porsche 911 is cool, a Lamborghini is cool, a Mercedes or an Audi is cool. Yet ￼ maybe I’m the only one with the big dick in the room, I brag that I drive a Toyota Prius? Everyone is always so shocked and impressed. Real investors and economists must and should drive a Prius! OK, whenever I discover anybody who’s a professor, who teaches in a business school, is an economist, academic or scholar or whatever… Yet just puts all of their money in a boring mutual fund… Or index fund… It is a signal that they are not a real economist, and they are actually not really connected to reality. We need some sort of risk exposure to the real world. For example, easy to be the typical fat American who is drinking beer or wine watching sports and American football, giving their opinion on sports teams and players yet they are not actually exposed to the risk of playing real tackle football? And once again… The more I think about it the more bizarre it is. To watch UFC or mixed martial arts, to watch any sport that you have not yourself played… It kind of like mental masturbation? To sports? Sports is masculine physical sports masturbation pornography? Just think about it the average person eats nachos french fries drink beer or alcohol smoke marijuana before watching the big game. But what a athlete who is actually participating in the sport down a beer really quick before putting on their armor and hitting the field? Obviously not! So why is it that alcohol food beverages is marketed to these individuals, for watching a sport? It is the new risk free premium hedonism; the joy of seeing people get murdered on a field, or in our arena without any real exposure. People are always so surprised that I played real football real American tackle football in high school, they are shocked to hear that I was linebacker, first outside linebacker then inside linebacker. ￼ I think it is actually racism; you never expect an Asian guy to play linebacker because we are not seen as masculine or aggressive enough. But if I were African-American or black, even though I am on the more lean side — you probably would not be shocked, because in America, athletes are always seen as being African-American, never Asian. Even an Asian professional sports athlete is almost seen as a glitch in the system, not the real deal. Even when first deadlifted 465 pounds, sumo style off the floor, and everyone was so shocked, I was talking to my friend Jemal and I asked him — “If I was African-American or black, but people will be asshocked or surprised?” He laughed and said no! So I think the first thing you have to think philosophically is what are you really searching for, and why? My very simple thought is think 300 years ahead, your kids kids kids. The current lifestyle is like the Persian slave lifestyle?￼ I think the issue we are facing today in today’s world is hedonism — the new hedonism. We seek companionship through humans or dogs, yet we don’t want to have children, we want to preserve our freedom travel the world go to Japan eat good sushi whatever. But, your dog cannot inherit your bitcoin. ￼￼ I think maybe in the past life was actually easier and more straightforward people. You got married, you built up a family legacy and empire; this was actually a pretty good strategy in life. And I think people were actually much happier, productive, and joyful! Think about all the modern day melodies of depression anxiety whatever, they are all modern day sociological ills. In fact, the ancient Greeks, thinking about the Iliad; certainly things are natural like courage, cowardice, and fear… But depression anxiety was not. My sociological theory on why so many people are so depressed and anxious is because of YouTube, Spotify, podcast, TikTok Facebook Instagram, Twitter, news, fear porn. ￼ Have a theory; a lot of people are secretly waiting and twiddling their thumbs, they actually want to see the world burn to the floor, to be able to have the indignant feeling; “I told you… I was right all along!” For example, all these people, are during Covid and pre-Covid and post Covid whatever, thought that there was gonna be food riots and blah blah blah, none of it happened. Humans are 1 trillion times more resilient than we make them out to be. ￼This is where also, philosophically I don’t really believe in short selling; even if you could cop a massive profit. For example there are certain things that I am certain which will go down to zero, like Ada Cardano and the like because it is fake. But rather than hoping that something is going to burn the floor, better to just bet on things that you think that will go to Mars! ￼ For example, everyone hates Elon Musk, and they are secretly waiting and plotting for him to fail. Yet doesn’t it take more courage to wish and hope and desire to see people succeed? Even I remember the Tesla model 3; everyone thought it would be impossible, but now, it is certainly the new Ford model T; the coolest, most desirable, most futuristic and affordable car on the road. I personally plan on driving my Toyota Prius until it dies at 1,000,000 miles, but if for one reason or another I was forced to purchase a brand new car, it would definitely be a Tesla, maybe the robotaxi? The reason why I encourage everyone to watch the Robo taxi, Robo van announcement is that it is the ultimate disruptor. For example, the Robo van, the two door coupe, insanely awesome design, with the butterfly McLaren doors… I find like there is no more reason to ever even want to buy a loser Lamborghini, or McLaren or whatever. And I really really love that rose gold, MATTE Rose gold Color on the Robo taxi, and also the rims look awesome! Once again, assuming that you’re a futurist like myself, the trillion dollar questions “why doesn’t the future actually look like the future?“ For example, if you really do believe in the digital transformation of things, like you care about Apple Tesla Amazon Facebook digital media whatever… Why would you ever buy analog property like a single-family home or whatever? Wouldn’t you prefer to buy digital property which is bitcoin? And also, issues with tax, property tax. Also assuming that you’re a libertarian, or some sort of anti-government person, bitcoin makes sense because it is like digital or cyber real estate that can’t be taxed! And I think the truth is that real rich people, know how to do tax deferment, or to avoid taxes, this is a real reason they become and stay rich. “My accountant so good I’m practically living tax-free!” – JAY Z￼￼￼ For example, even if you live in the lowest tax jurisdiction place which is Florida, and nobody wants to live in Florida, still… Under a base case scenario you’re still playing at least 1.1% in taxes. And that means then, the life of your asset is only 70 years; within 70 years Assuming you buy a $1 million property, you’re gonna pay $1 million in taxes in 70 years. Then, if you own a single-family home or whatever, or property the coal is actually trying to rent out your property at a premium, but two people who have never really had experience with property property management… It is a fucking nightmare and headache. Finding good tenants and keeping them; the holy Grail. Too much counterparty risk with properties; people who fuck up your property, end up not paying rent in squatting your place, people who start to grow marijuana inside your property, people who turn your property into a brothel (true story), or just physical wear and tear and decay. Anything in the physical realm in my opinion has too much risk. ￼And this is where still… In my eyes, Tesla is too much of a risk. Why? Having to build all those cyber trucks, Robo taxis, is just in my opinion, too much of a gargantuan physical task. Even if you automate the whole thing with robots, still, extracting lithium from the Earth, making the cars, delivering the cars, my personal estimate is you won’t see Robo taxis on the road for at least another five or seven years? To me that is too long. I think the best investment is something that you have a 100% certainty will go up in 30 years, and you just ignore the volatility and the noise on a day-to-day level. Yes especially if it is digital!￼ Also the funny thing is; bitcoin was the classic the first only immaculate conception; technically Ethereum from Vitalik was just a bitcoin copycat.￼ My very very basic suggestion is just download Coinbase to your phone, buy bitcoin from your traditional bank account, and once you’re done buying it, delete the Coinbase app from your phone, and never check prices. And what you doing instead it’s just go to michael.com, watch all the Michael sailor interviews, and read books on economic theory philosophy etc. I personally believe that the best wisdom is in the past; read Aristotle on economics, Fernandinho Galiani on money Della moneta, the principles of economic theory from Karl Menger etc. you should be able to find free PDFs of all these online, just read it on your iPad. ￼*** You buy the bitcoin, and you never sell it, just keep buying it until you die, and the idea is just give it to your kids kids kids. And you’re a supreme happiness and joy is through weightlifting, one red maxing, and seeing the numbers go up! ￼ My suggestion is never ever ever sell the bitcoin, for anything. If you need spare cash for living or whatever, better to borrow the money at 7% interest or lower, assuming that bitcoin is going to go up 21% year over a year, compounded rate forever. ￼ I would say only by microstrategy MSTR if you just cannot get access to capital to buy bitcoin directly. At the end of your life, he or she with the most bitcoin is going to be the winner. Or the corporate entity like micro strategy, who owns the most bitcoin. The goal is a Nakamoto, which is the mythical 1 million bitcoins. The same amount of bitcoins in Satoshi‘s wallet, which he hasn’t touched. ￼￼This is currently $60 billion! ￼ honestly because I live like a poor person, for me, at this point investing is just a new passion, almost like a new hobby. Still for me my critical passion is photography, blogging and like. ￼So the simple thought; know that investing in money is a means to an end not the in itself.

Cohen, who heads up the asset manager's exchange-traded funds and index investments as chief investment officer, told CNBC that BlackRock now sees the demand was for a better way to access bitcoin. "It was for the ETF wrapper," she told CNBC on stage at the Permissionless Conference in Utah. The total market cap of all eleven spot bitcoin ETFs now tops $63 billion, with total flows of nearly $20 billion. In the last five trading days alone, spot bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows of more than $2.1 billion, with BlackRock accounting for half of those sales. The spike in trading volume comes as bitcoin hit its highest level since July this week, trading above $68,300. Bitcoin ended the third quarter up around 140% from the same quarter a year ago, outpacing the S&P 500, as these spot token funds and the crypto market cap move higher in lock-step. Crypto-aligned stock Coinbase closed up about 24% this week, its best week since February. Cohen told CNBC that part of the strategy for attracting customers to its funds was teaching crypto investors about the benefits of exchange-traded products (ETPs). 13F filings, which offer quarterly reads on equity positions taken by large investors, show that 80% of the buyers of these new spot bitcoin products in the U.S. are direct investors. Of the 80% of direct investors, Cohen told CNBC that 75% had never before owned an iShare, one of the best-known and largest ETF providers on the planet. "So we went into this journey with the expectation that we needed to educate ETF investors on crypto and on bitcoin specifically," said Cohen. "As it turns out, we have done a lot of education of crypto investors on the benefits of the ETP wrapper." Before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission green-lit spot bitcoin funds in January, investors had a few ways to buy and custody cryptocurrencies. A centralized exchange like Coinbase was among the most user-friendly options for U.S investors. But the blockbuster debut of bitcoin ETPs has laid bare to Cohen and others across Wall Street, that crypto exchanges weren't giving digital asset investors everything they needed. It helps that the U.S. is a huge market for digital assets. New data from Chainalysis shows that North America remains the biggest crypto market globally, accounting for nearly 23% of all crypto trading volume. The blockchain analytics platform estimates that between July 2023 and July 2024, there was $1.3 trillion in on-chain value received. Venture firm a16z found in its recently released State of Crypto report that more than 40 million Americans hold crypto. So far, adoption has mostly been through wealth management clients asking advisors to add new spot crypto products to their portfolio. In August, Morgan Stanley was the first big bank to allow its 15,000 financial advisors to pitch bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity to clients with a net worth over $1.5 million. Other firms are still performing in-house due diligence before allowing their armies of FAs to start actively pitching the funds. "Wealth manager allocators have not been allocating," VanEck CEO Jan van Eck told CNBC in Utah. "I mean, they're barely even warming up." Van Eck drew parallels to the European market, where the company has 12 token-based products trading in Europe. "It's exactly what we see in Europe," he said. "Very few private banks have really approved investment in bitcoin or ethereum or anything else in a major way." Van Eck said his company has about $2 billion in its European crypto ETPs, and that a lot of the volume is from individual investors. Wall Street needs rules from lawmakers on Capitol Hill before it gets more comfortable with crypto. Cohen thinks that in a lot of ways, ETFs and blockchain technology are solving for similar things. "ETFs have been a decentralizing force in TradFi markets that have brought a lot more access and transparency, and importantly, really accelerated in growth during the post crisis 2008, 2009 period," said Cohen, referring to traditional finance markets. "I find it incredibly meaningful to look at the fact that the bitcoin whitepaper was published on October 31, 2008, and then you have the G20 leaders from around the world meeting to discuss the aftermath of the financial crisis and how do you create more transparency through public reporting," Cohen continued. BlackRock took on less risk by using counterparty clearing and multilateral trading. In TradFi markets, those moves created huge tailwinds for ETFs. "Then at the same time, DeFi is becoming a reality over the intervening 15 years," she said. "Was this a win for Bitcoin? Was this a win for ETPs? To me, the answer is: It's a win for investors, to the extent we can effectively marry these ecosystems which are solving for the same goals." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Nvidia Can Approach $5 Trillion Valuation With ‘Generational’ AI Opportunity Still Ahead, BofA Says

Nvidia stock has much more room to run up its all-time high share price set this week, argue Bank of America analysts, who just meaningfully upped their price target for the artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia due to a highly favorable growth horizon. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang The Bank of America group led by Vivek Arya raised their Nvidia target from $165 to $190, indicating 37% upside from Nvidia’s $138 share price Friday, a fresh weekly closing high. Arya and company argued a “generational opportunity” is still ahead for Nvidia in AI accelerators, the full-stack semiconductor systems necessary for generative AI applications of which Nvidia captures roughly 80% of the market as its big-ticket customers like Alphabet, Meta and OpenAI invest heavily in Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to train large-language models. Bank of America projects the total addressable market for this AI technology will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year to $363 billion by year’s end, while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, translating to a whopping $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. For reference, Apple generated $204 billion of revenue from iPhones in 2023. Other positive catalysts named by Bank of America include significantly higher profit margins than its peers, with its free cash flow margin of roughly 50% over the next two years forecasted at twice as much as the average of the other five trillion-dollar American technology giants, and its “underappreciated” income streams outside of selling its custom GPUs, including lucrative partnerships with consultancy Accenture and Microsoft. $4.7 trillion. That’s the Nvidia market capitalization implied by Bank of America analysts’ $190 price target. That’s much higher than the market value of any public company ever, a title held by Apple at $3.6 trillion. Nvidia is the world’s second-most valuable company with a $3.4 trillion market cap. That’s a far cry from the roughly $10 billion valuation it held a decade ago and the sub-$300 billion market cap it boasted just two years ago. Nvidia’s stock market ascension followed the late 2022 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, which inspired significant earnings growth for the company as Nvidia’s graphics processing units are at the core of these AI applications. Nvidia’s sales and net income were 350% and 2,400% higher during the quarter ending in July than they were during 2022’s comparable period, respectively. Originally a company known for its role in video game graphics, Nvidia is still led by its founding CEO Jensen Huang, who is the 11th-richest person in the world thanks to his 3% stake in the company, according to Forbes’ calculations. Common valuation metrics indicate Nvidia stock is expensive relative to its fundamentals – it has the second-highest price-to-sales ratio, which compares a company’s market cap to its last 12-month revenues, on the S&P 500, but many remain bullish thanks to what Huang describes as “emotional” and “insane demand for Nvidia’s products.

Title: Campbell PD receives FAA nod for 24/7 drone operations
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/campbell-pd-receives-faa-nod-for-247-drone-operations-93CH-3671562

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - In a significant development for public safety technology, the Campbell Police Department has been granted a waiver by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone operations both during the day and at night. This waiver, a first of its kind to include nighttime flights, allows the department to utilize Dedrone by Axon's advanced DedroneBeyond technology without the need for visual observers. The Drone as a First Responder (DFR) program by the Campbell Police Department, which began in 2022, has been pivotal in improving emergency response by providing immediate aerial insights upon receiving 911 calls. The FAA's recent approval under part 91.113(b) enhances the program by permitting the use of DedroneBeyond's ground-based detect and avoid system, thus enabling round-the-clock drone operations. The DedroneBeyond system acts as a virtual visual observer, allowing remote pilots to manage drones from a control center and swiftly respond to incidents, reaching altitudes up to 400 feet. The AI-driven technology ensures safe operation by accurately detecting and avoiding manned aircraft without compromising the mission through false alarms. Chief Gary Berg of the Campbell Police Department emphasized the significance of this approval, stating that it would allow for quicker and more efficient emergency responses, ultimately bolstering both officer and public safety. Aaditya Devarakonda, CEO of Dedrone by Axon, echoed the sentiment, highlighting the transformative nature of the FAA's decision for law enforcement across the nation. The DFR program in Campbell incorporates technology from industry leaders such as Axon Air Remote powered by DroneSense and MatrixSpace, providing drone operators with a comprehensive view for airspace management and mission control. Axon, recognized as a global leader in public safety technologies, is set to exhibit its latest innovations, including DFR solutions, at the upcoming IACP Annual Conference in Boston. This news is based on a press release statement, which outlines the collaboration between Axon and the Campbell Police Department in advancing public safety through innovative technology. In other recent news, Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) has been making significant strides in its financial performance and innovation. The company reported record-breaking earnings in the second quarter, with revenue surpassing $500 million and new business bookings exceeding $1 billion. This robust growth was driven by new products, TASER 10 and Axon Body 4, and a shift in revenue mix, with software and services accounting for 39% of total revenue. Baird, an independent global financial services firm, has maintained its Outperform rating on Axon while raising the stock's price target. This decision reflects their confidence in Axon's continued expansion and innovation, highlighting the potential for new artificial intelligence capabilities to act as a catalyst for the company's growth. Axon's software segment has shown impressive growth, with a 47% year-over-year increase in the second quarter, now approaching an annualized revenue of nearly $800 million. The company's future contracted revenue stands at approximately $7.4 billion, and full-year revenue guidance has been raised to between $2 billion and $2.05 billion. Adjusted EBITDA reached $123 million, with a margin of 24.5% for the quarter. Despite these positive developments, Axon executives have expressed cautiousness regarding potential economic downturns. However, they also highlighted the fastest growth in their Cloud and Services segment at 47% year-over-year, and an increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) to $850 million, a 44% increase year-over-year. These are the recent developments in Axon Enterprise's financial performance and analyst ratings. As Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AXON) continues to innovate in the public safety technology sector, its financial performance reflects the company's strong market position. According to InvestingPro data, Axon's revenue growth has been impressive, with a 32.59% increase in the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This growth aligns with the company's expanding product offerings, such as the DedroneBeyond technology mentioned in the article. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Axon's net income is expected to grow this year, and analysts anticipate sales growth in the current year. These projections suggest that the company's investments in advanced technologies like drone operations and AI-driven systems are likely to contribute positively to its financial performance. The company's strong market position is further underscored by its impressive gross profit margins, which stand at 59.81% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This indicates Axon's ability to maintain profitability while investing in cutting-edge technologies for law enforcement agencies. It's worth noting that Axon's stock has shown a remarkable performance, with a 97.91% price total return over the past year. This suggests that investors are optimistic about the company's growth prospects and its role in shaping the future of public safety technology.

Title: Jeff Shultz, Paramount’s Streaming Strategy Chief, Is Exiting

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Jeff Shultz, who has served as chief strategy officer and chief business development officer of Paramount Global‘s streaming division, is leaving the company at the end of the year. Shultz joined Paramount in 2019 as part of the acquisition of Pluto TV and was a key executive on the leadership team that launched and grew the Paramount+ subscription service. He has overseen strategy, distribution and business development for both Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Shultz announced that he will leave Paramount Global in a post Friday on LinkedIn. “To my colleagues at Paramount Streaming, writing this incredible story with you has been the honor of my career,” he wrote. “I’m sorry I won’t be with you for the next chapter, but I can’t wait to see where you go from here.” Related Stories VIP+ Latest Music Licensing Deals Underscore Social Media Giants’ Frenemy Status ‘Disorder,' Anthology Film Depicting Turbulent Life in Lebanon, Acquired for World Sales by Front Row Ahead of El Gouna Fest Premiere Paramount is expanding the role of Ray Hopkins, president of U.S. networks distribution, to now include streaming and linear partners/distribution, the company’s three co-CEOs — George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins — announced in an internal memo Friday. As a result of this shift, Shultz “will be departing the organization and the Streaming [distribution and business development] team will now transition under Ray,” the execs said in the memo. Popular on Variety In July, Paramount Global and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone clinched a deal to merge Paramount with Skydance Media, a transaction expected to close in the first half of 2025. In the meantime, Paramount has engaged in layoffs and restructuring in its U.S. workforce aimed at slashing 15% of its domestic headcount. Separately Friday, Paramount disclosed that Charles Phillips Jr., who led the board’s special committee on M&A that ultimately reached a deal to merge the company with Skydance, is exiting the board of directors. Shultz joined Pluto TV as chief business officer in early 2018, after serving as an adviser to the free, ad-supported streaming startup for three years. A year later, Viacom acquired the free, ad-supported streaming startup for $340 million. Tom Ryan, former CEO of Pluto TV, is now CEO of Paramount Streaming. Ryan, in a comment on Shultz’s LinkedIn post, said: “Jeff, thank you for everything you have done for Paramount Streaming. Pluto TV and Paramount+ would never have come so far so fast without your talent, drive, optimism and collaboration. We will be forever grateful for your immense contributions and you will be sorely missed.” “Six and a half years ago, celebrating the acquisition of Pluto TV by Viacom with the team in Santa Barbara, I gave a toast recognizing the moment that concluded: ‘We’re just getting started,'” Shultz wrote in the LinkedIn post. “Despite all we have accomplished since then, I still feel the same way. So with mixed emotions I share that I will be leaving Paramount later this year.” Shultz touted deals that he cut for Pluto TV’s service, including with the NFL, Major League Baseball, Warner Bros. Discovery, A+E Networks, AMC Networks, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Lionsgate, MGM, Fremantle and Banijay Entertainment. Under his leadership, Pluto TV also inked partnership deals with Amazon, Roku, Google, Apple, T-Mobile, Verizon, Comcast, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Vizio and more. In 2019, the year Viacom acquired Pluto TV, the free streamer generated about $70 million in revenue; three years later, “Pluto TV was a billion-dollar business,” according to Shultz. In 2021, the company rebranded CBS All Access as Paramount+ to create the Paramount Streaming division. In the second quarter of 2024, the division reported revenue of $1.9 billion, representing one-fourth of Paramount Global revenue. Prior to Pluto TV, Shultz held senior leadership roles in digital business development at media companies including NBC and CBS, and internet TV startups Clicker and Concert TV, which he co-founded. In 2022, Shultz was named to Variety’s Dealmaker Impact Report. He began his career as a lawyer for Linklaters in London after earning a law degree from Georgetown University. In his LinkedIn post, Shultz said he was “deeply grateful for the leadership and friendship of Tom Ryan, and the partnership and excellence of the Paramount Streaming leadership team Elizabeth Wright, Domenic DiMeglio, Jeff Grossman, Amy Kuessner, Olivier Jollet, Marco Nobili, Erin Calhoun, and Abhinav Chopra.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Daniel Hurley and Louis Kahn return as does former captain and club stalwart Aidan Moynihan on the bench. UCD welcome back Emerging Ireland lock Conor O’Tighearnaigh along with fellow Leinster Academy players, Ruben Moloney, Ben Brownlee, Rory McGuire, and Alan Spicer in a stacked pack for their bottom two clash at City Of Armagh.

Title: Nvidia stock has another 38% upside amid a 'generational opportunity' in AI, Bank of America says

Nvidia stock has been on a tear all year, but investors can brace for even more gains ahead, Bank of America analysts say. In a Thursday note, the analysts raised their price objective on the stock from $165 to $190. That implies a 38% upside from its price of about $138 a share at midday on Friday. The analysts point to exponential growth in the AI market in the coming years, which they say will give Nvidia a "generational opportunity" as the chip titan continues to strengthen its lead in the market. The analysts see the AI accelerator market growing to $280 billion by 2027, and toward upwards of $400 billion over time — marking huge growth from $45 billion in 2023. As AI models continue to grow rapidly—with developers like OpenAI, Google, and Meta launching new large language models several times per year—the need for computing will only grow, the analysts predict. Each new major LLM generation, especially those developed for larger size and better reasoning capabilities, will require greater training intensity, they add. "We continue to see the pace of new model development increase. LLMs in particular are being developed for both larger size and better reasoning capabilities, which both require greater training intensity," the analysts said. They also point to Nvidia's strong partnerships with enterprise customers like Accenture, ServiceNow, Oracle, and others, which show the growing presence of AI at big companies and Nvidia's role as partner of choice. "​​NVDA's engagements span multiple verticals (e.g., Accenture, ServiceNow, Microsoft), and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side," the analysts said. The analysts also said Nvidia's financials are set up well for future gains. Given its free cash flow generation at 45%-50% margins, which is nearly double that of other Magnificent 7 stocks, Nvidia will be able to generate $200 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, they wrote. Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed this year, up 187% as AI continues to boom after a brief sell-off over the summer. The sector has since recovered, with chip stocks like Nvidia and TSMC trading at or near all-time highs in recent weeks. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks Jump to

Title: Utilities outperform the broader markets amid enthusiasm over AI electricity demand
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/utilities-outperform-the-broader-markets-amid-enthusiasm-over-ai-electricity-demand-175702728.html
Time Published: 2024-10-18T17:57:02Z
Full Content:
Utilities have been on fire this year as enthusiasm over booming AI electricity demand pushes the sector higher. Case in point: The S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) is up a whopping 29% so far this year — the best-performing sector to date, compared to the broader index's 23% rise. Much of the gains stem from enthusiasm over power producers that stand to benefit from the electrification boom — which includes Big Tech's massive appetite for AI data centers and electric vehicles. By 2050, electricity is projected to become the largest source of energy worldwide, according to a recent McKinsey study. Also, five of the top 10 returning companies in the S&P 500 this year have been energy companies, noted Matt Sallee, president of Tortoise Capital. “Utilities and midstream infrastructure are going to be secondary beneficiaries of the AI theme,” he said in a recent note. There’s no better example of that investor fever than the S&P 500's top performer this year, power producer Vistra Corp (VST). Shares of the Irving, Texas-based company are up 243% year to date, outperforming even AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), up 186% during the same period. On Thursday, JPMorgan analysts initiated coverage of Vistra along with two other Wall Street favorites, Talen Energy (TLN) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — all with an Overweight rating, The analysts said the independent power producers (IPPs) stand to benefit from "a paradigm shift in power demand" amid structural tailwinds like manufacturing on-shoring, electrification trends, and data-center development. "We do not see competitive market supply growth matching this demand, enabling IPPs to capture outsized margins for an extended period of time," wrote JPMorgan's Jeremy Tonet and his team. As Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman pointed out, recent headlines like Microsoft (MSFT) teaming up with Constellation Energy to restart a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, and Amazon (AMZN) buying up a data center campus from Talen Energy have put Big Tech and its insatiable need for electricity into the spotlight. But XLU's massive performance this year begs the question — has it topped? With the broader markets at all-time highs, it may be a good idea to keep investing in defensive stocks like utilities that provide dividends, said Burns McKinney, managing director and senior portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group. “There does seem to be a little bit more meat on the bone,” said McKinney, referring to more growth ahead. If XLU holds its 29.1% year-to-date gains, it will be the best-ever yearly performance for the sector. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X at @ines_ferre.

Title: Netflix doesn't think it needs to bundle with other streamers — yet. Here's why
URL: https://qz.com/netflix-bundles-ceo-ted-sarandos-1851676407
Time Published: 2024-10-18T17:34:00Z
Full Content:
While other streaming services are increasingly turning to bundles to help boost subscriber numbers, Netflix (NFLX+11.12%) says it doesn’t need them. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on Thursday that a lot of the company’s competitors are using bundles to “find growth in their businesses.” He added that this made sense and was a “comfortable” business model for legacy media companies, given “the narrow scope of the libraries on these services and the fairly limited engagement.” Instead, he said, Netflix is focused on adding more value to its own package, which he characterized as “amazing series and films and now games at a remarkably low price all in one place.” Sarandos’ comments come at a time when other media companies are struggling to catch up with the dominant Netflix and are still trying to figure out how to make their services consistently profitable. One emerging strategy to boost subscriber numbers is bundling. For example, in July, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery teamed up to offer a new bundle that combines all of their streaming platforms into one monthly subscription plan. Sarandos was also reaffirming the sentiments expressed in Netflix’s letter to shareholders included in its strong third-quarter earnings report on Thursday. “Programming for such a large, engaged audience, with so much variety and great quality, is hard. It’s why streaming services which lack our breadth of content are increasingly looking to bundle their offerings,” the letter said. And so far it seems like investors are in agreement, as Netflix stock jumped 9% on Friday. “Overall, we believe Netflix is well positioned to remain a long-term winner in the streaming space,” wrote William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart in a note on Friday. Simlarly Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a note on Friday, “Netflix has established a virtually insurmountable lead in the streaming wars. We expect it to maintain this competitive edge while rivals struggle to replicate its business model.” She also expressed optimism about Netflix’s growing ad business suggesting it could “become the primary growth driver by 2026.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Netflix (NFLX) shares surged to a record high Friday, a day after the streaming giant’s third-quarter earnings beat expectations, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. Bank of America boosted its price target to $800 from $740, calling Netflix “one of the best positioned companies within media,” with multiple growth drivers including its “burgeoning ad business.” Netflix’s ad-supported membership grew 35% quarter-over-quarter, and the company said it expects to launch an ad tech platform in 2025. Analysts at JPMorgan lifted their price target even higher, to $850 from $750, and called Netflix a "top pick," citing its "strong leadership position" with a “virtuous circle of strong subscriber growth, more revenue, and growing profit.” Including Bank of America, about three-quarters of the 20 analysts covering Netflix tracked by Visible Alpha held a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock as of Friday, though their average price target at $777.21 was not far off from Friday's closing price. Shares of Netflix jumped over 11% to close at $763.89 Friday and have gained nearly 57% since the start of the year. Netflix's gains came despite some programming challenges, calling it “patchier than normal,” due to the lingering impacts of actors and writers strikes in 2023, and said “volume has picked up again.” Netflix said it delivered several hits in the quarter, with “The Perfect Couple” starring Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber drawing 65.2 million views, while romantic comedy “Nobody Wants This" with Kristen Bell and Adam Brody drew 37 million.

Title: BlackRock to integrate BUIDL fund as collateral for Binance, OKX, and Deribit

Share this article BlackRock is advancing into the crypto derivatives market by integrating its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, as collateral for crypto trades, according to a report by Bloomberg. The asset management giant is in discussions with major crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Deribit, aiming to expand BUIDL’s use in derivatives. Already accepted by prime brokers FalconX and Hidden Road, BUIDL’s adoption could challenge dominant stablecoins like USDT and USDC in collateral markets. With a minimum investment of $5 million, BlackRock’s BUIDL token is designed for institutional investors. By having it accepted as collateral, BlackRock aims to provide a highly liquid and secure alternative for derivatives traders. This could shake up the current dominance of USDT, which holds a market value of $120 billion and is the most commonly used collateral in crypto derivatives. BlackRock launched its BUIDL token in March 2024 as part of its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The token is a blockchain-based representation of a traditional money-market fund that invests in assets like US Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. BUIDL distinguishes itself from other stablecoins by offering interest to holders, making it an attractive option for institutional investors seeking both yield and security. If exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Deribit integrate BUIDL, the token could become a standard for institutional collateral, providing a regulated, yield-bearing alternative to existing stablecoins. In addition to its focus on BUIDL, BlackRock has been actively leading the Bitcoin ETF space. Since the start of October alone, BlackRock has acquired over $2.2 billion worth of Bitcoin, accounting for 8% of their total Bitcoin holdings. BlackRock’s leadership in acquiring Bitcoin spot ETFs is set to expand their influence across both spot and derivatives markets. The integration of BUIDL as collateral for derivatives trades could complement their Bitcoin strategy, allowing for a diversified presence across crypto markets.

Title: American Express' Mixed Q3 Results: Goldman Analyst Sees Silver Lining In Expense Management And NII Growth

Time Published: 2024-10-18T17:09:24Z

American Express Co (NYSE:AXP) stock slid Friday after its third-quarter print failed to impress the Street. The third-quarter revenue (net of interest expense) grew 8% year-on-year to $16.64 billion, marginally missing the analyst consensus estimate of $16.67 billion. Higher loan volumes, stable growth in Card Member spending, and accelerated card fee revenue growth triggered the topline growth. Also Read: What’s Going On With Trump Media & Technology Group Stock On Friday? Goldman Sachs analyst Ryan M. Nash reiterated a Buy rating on American Express with a price target of $300. Goldman Sachs: Nash summarized American Express Co’s third-quarter performance. It reported third-quarter 2024 earnings per share (EPS) of $3.49, surpassing Visible Alpha’s consensus estimate of $3.30. Core pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) exceeded expectations at $4.56 billion compared to the consensus of $4.45 billion, as lower expenses offset slightly weaker revenue. Core revenue grew 8% year-over-year (FX-adjusted) to $16.64 billion, just shy of the $16.67 billion estimate. Net interest income (NII) rose 16% year-over-year to $4.01 billion, beating expectations of $3.92 billion. In comparison, fees grew 5.8% year-over-year to $12.63 billion, falling short of the $12.75 billion projection due to lower discount revenues. Billed business increased 6% year-over-year (FX-adjusted) to $441 billion, with Goods & Services up 6% and Travel & Entertainment (T&E) slowing to 6%, down from 7% the previous quarter. Expenses were 1% lower than anticipated, primarily due to reduced variable engagement costs (VECs), as total cardmember costs (including marketing) rose 12% year-over-year to $8.25 billion, below the expected $8.5 billion. Core operating expenses were higher at $3.83 billion compared to the $3.72 billion estimate. Credit performance was in line with expectations, with provisions at $1.36 billion and net charge-offs of 2.1%, which were better than anticipated. American Express adjusted its full-year 2024 guidance, lowering expected revenue growth to 9% (from the previous 9 – 11% range) and raising its EPS outlook to $13.75 – $14.05, up from the previous $13.30 – $13.80. This increase includes a $0.66 gain from Accertify. According to Nash, this was a mixed quarter for American Express. Revenues came in slightly below expectations due to weaker discount revenues. However, higher NII and card fees provided some support. Lower-than-expected expenses helped offset higher operating costs. Credit metrics remained steady, with provisions meeting expectations and losses coming in lower than anticipated. However, the market may be concerned about American Express Co’s revenue mix as NII thrives (16% Y/Y). In comparison, discount revenues increased only 4% Y/Y, raising questions about future growth. The outlook for revenue growth, significantly as NII will likely slow, will likely be a key focus on the upcoming call. On the upcoming call, Nash will seek insight into what drove American Express Co’s decision to revise its year-over-year revenue growth forecast to around 9%, down from the previous 9%-11%, and the company’s outlook for future revenue growth. The analyst also expected updates on card fees. He will seek an update on billed business growth, which stayed flat this quarter. Additionally, it will be necessary to hear about the trajectory for net interest income (NII), as the growth rate slowed slightly from 20% in the second quarter to 17% but still shows strong performance. Further, Nash sought the company’s view on customer engagement costs, which were down quarter-over-quarter, with VECs expected to stay near 42%, though they were 40.7% in the third quarter. The analyst also expects more information on the 3.3 million new card acquisitions and whether the company can sustain this momentum. Finally, he sought clarity on credit performance, as net charge-offs (NCOs) came in better than expected. American Express updated its 2024 guidance, anticipating revenue growth of around 9%, down from the prior 9% – 11%, which matches the consensus estimate of $65.99 billion. It also raised its EPS outlook to $13.75 – $14.05, up from $13.30 – $13.80, with the midpoint implying $13.90 versus the consensus of $13.74. Based on this, Nash estimates fourth-quarter EPS of around $2.95, just below the consensus of $2.98, and revenue of approximately $17.19 billion, indicating 3.3% quarter-over-quarter growth.

Sorry, dividend investors: You probably won’t be rushing to add Netflix (NFLX) to your portfolios. During the streaming giant’s third-quarter earnings call on Thursday, CFO Spencer Neuman said that the company has "no plans to increase leverage to buy back stock or to issue a dividend." Neuman said Netflix is still prioritizing “profitable growth by reinvesting in our business” and maintaining “ample liquidity.” Wall Street expects Netflix's full-year free cash flow to top $10 billion in 2026, according to Visible Alpha data. Still, Neuman said Netflix isn’t planning to change its capital allocation strategy. The company said Thursday that it repurchased $1.7 billion of its shares during the third quarter, with more than $3 billion of currently authorized buybacks remaining. “In terms of [the] kind of future of free cash flow, well, that future of throwing off tens of billions of free cash flow, that would be a great future and would be a nice challenge to have,” said Neuman on the call, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. “But no change to our capital allocation policy.” Netflix reported third-quarter results on Thursday. The company's stock was recently up more than 10%. Other big tech companies have a history of issuing dividends—including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL).

Netflix (NFLX) stock jumped more than 10% higher on Friday, pushing shares to a fresh record of around $760, after the streaming giant beat third quarter EPS and revenue estimates and projected sales for the current quarter that came in ahead of Wall Street's expectations. Revenue beat Bloomberg consensus estimates of $9.78 billion to hit $9.83 billion in Q3, Netflix reported after the market close on Thursday, an increase of 15% compared to the same period last year. The growth came as the streamer continued to lean on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to last year's price hikes on certain subscription plans. Netflix guided to fourth quarter revenue of $10.13 billion, a beat compared to consensus estimates of $10.01 billion. For full-year 2025, the company sees revenue hitting between $43 billion and $44 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $43.4 billion. This would represent growth of 11% to 13% from the company's expected 2024 revenue guidance of $38.9 billion. It expects full-year operating margins to hit 27%, an increase from the previous 26%, after the metric hit nearly 30% in the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) also beat estimates in the quarter, with the company reporting EPS of $5.40, above consensus expectations of $5.16 and well ahead of the $3.73 EPS figure it reported in the year-ago period. Netflix guided to fourth quarter EPS of $4.23, ahead of consensus calls for $3.90. Subscribers also came in strong with another 5 million-plus subscribers added on the heels of breakout programming like "The Perfect Couple" and "Nobody Wants This." Subscriber additions of 5.07 million beat expectations of 4.5 million and follows the 8.05 million net additions the streamer added in the second quarter. The company had added 8.8 million paying users in Q3 2023. "We expect paid net additions to be higher in Q4 than in Q3’24 due to normal seasonality and a strong content slate," the company said, citing upcoming releases like "Squid Game" Season 2, the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight, and two NFL games on Christmas Day. Investors have praised the company's foray into sports and live events. Meanwhile, its ad tier continues to gain traction, accounting for over 50% of sign-ups in the countries where it's offered during the third quarter. "We continue to build our advertising business and improve our offering for advertisers," the company said in the earnings release. "Ads membership was up 35% quarter on quarter, and our ad tech platform is on track to launch in Canada in Q4 and more broadly in 2025." Last quarter, Netflix revealed it secured "a 150% plus increase in upfront ad sales commitments over 2023." The company has previously said its goal is to make ads "a more substantial revenue stream that contributes to sustained, healthy revenue growth in 2025 and beyond." On the earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said that while ads won't be a primary driver of revenue next year as "we're still scaling that audience and that inventory faster than our ability to monetize it," the company sees an "opportunity to close that gap." Leading up to the results, Netflix's stock had been on a tear, with shares up around 45% since the start of the year and trading near all-time highs. Analysts expect another price hike by the end of the year, which will likely serve as yet another catalyst for shares. But the stock's recent run-up has led to some apprehension on Wall Street. The company recently revealed subscribers watched over 94 billion hours on the platform from January to June as part of its latest biannual viewership report, although year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to pricing power, which has become especially important for streaming companies as consumers become more picky. On average, US consumers subscribe to four streaming services and spend about $61 per month, according to the latest Digital Media Trends report from Deloitte. Retaining loyal subscribers over time is a challenge due to consumers churning out of, or canceling, their subscription plans. Netflix last raised the price of its Standard plan in January 2022, upping the monthly cost to $15.49 from $13.99. It also raised the price of its Premium tier by $2 to $19.99 a month at the same time; the company again raised the cost of that plan last October to $22.99. The company has yet to raise the price of its ad-supported offering, introduced less than two years ago, which remains one of the cheapest ad plans among all of the major streaming players at $6.99 a month. "Given Netflix’s low cost per viewed hour, we see scope for the firm to raise US prices by 12% in 2025," Citi analyst Jason Bazinet said ahead of the report. The company recently phased out its lowest-priced ad-free streaming plan, making the $15.49 Standard plan its cheapest offering for an ad-free experience.

Investing.com -- Jefferies analysts upgraded their price target for AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) from $108 to $175 in a note Friday, citing optimistic trends in mobile gaming ad spending revealed in their latest survey. The survey, representing over $1.2 billion in app install spending, reportedly suggests that major players like APP, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are expected to gain market share in 2025, while Unity (U) may lose ground. In their note, Jefferies analysts said the initial outlook for 2025 app install spending indicates a significant acceleration to 6.7% growth. While the survey forecasts a modest 2.7% growth for 2024, 2025 is projected to benefit from increased spending on new game launches and successful existing titles. "We see this initial view into 2025 as optimistic for the ad networks," stated Jefferies. The analysts also highlighted that ad spending is expected to grow by 3.2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024. Moreover, Jefferies reported that APP was the largest share gainer in 2024 and is anticipated to continue this momentum into 2025. "APP's user quality and ability to scale spend" were underscored as key advantages. The analysts pointed out that the rising cost per install (CPI) on platforms like YouTube and Meta, particularly due to holiday and political spending, could lead to a shift in shares toward mobile-game-specific networks. Despite pressures on effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPMs), Jefferies forecasts that the overall mobile game ad revenue will experience growth in 2025. "Our survey suggests that APP should be able to sustain 20-30% Software Platform revenue growth for at least the next two years," the note added. With this outlook, Jefferies sees a potential bull case price target of $246 for APP, driven by incremental ad budgets from e-commerce.

Title: Data centers try to cool it as AI explodes, and Big Tech goes nuclear

UPDATED 10:55 EDT / OCTOBER 18 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof What a turnaround for nuclear power — and it’s all thanks to artificial intelligence. This week two more Big Tech companies bet on nukes as Google and Amazon joined the party Microsoft started a few weeks ago. All that training of AI models takes a lot of power. And that’s despite, or because of, the fact that AI models are getting smaller and easier to use, as a raft of announcements this week made apparent. AI is also exploding the data center, as all the talk at the Open Compute Project’s Global Summit this week was about accommodating AI workloads — such as Crusoe’s plans for building an AI megafactory in Texas — and the massive increase in power, heat and networking needs they require. Indeed, as a result, networking is the not-so-new but now critical bottleneck in the data center. Companies such as Lightmatter and xScape Photonics are betting big on the opportunity. Paul Gillin lays out the very public Snowflake-Databricks clash in detail in the definitive story of the latest battle of the AI era. Ironically, given all the heat AI is producing, it’s about Apache Iceberg, the management layer that sits atop data files in cloud storage. Google shook up its management team, in particular in search and ads, as well as Gemini AI. It looks like DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has finally consolidated his hold on all things AI at Google. Down is up and up is down in the chip industry. In a hell-freezes-over moment, Intel and AMD decided to cooperate on standardizing the x86 chip instruction set. Meanwhile, TSMC and ASML issued widely different earnings results — chipmaker TSMC benefiting from roaring AI chip sales and equipment maker ASML suffering from a drop in sales to China and Samsung. Next week’s events include UiPath Forward and Celonis’ Celosphere, and we’ll have news and interviews on theCUBE from both. The enterprise earnings season kicks off with IBM, Seagate and SAP, ahead of a much large number of reports the following two weeks from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and many others. TheCUBE Research analysts John Furrier and Dave Vellante discuss this and other news in more detail on this week’s theCUBE Pod, out later today on YouTube. And don’t miss Vellante’s weekly deep dive, Breaking Analysis, arriving this weekend for some lean-back reading. Meantime, check out this past week’s installment, zeroing in on Microsoft’s much-debated Azure revenue and what it means for the overall cloud market. Here’s all of this week’s top news, newsy topics and analysis from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Big-data dust-up: Why two AI giants are at war over who is more open Accel says generative AI startups get 40% of VC investment in cloud OpenAI, Microsoft reportedly hire banks to renegotiate partnership terms Generative AI churns the waters at European NoCode Summit The next phase of AI: Unlocking explainability with causal intelligence Mistral introduces Ministral 3B and 8B AI computing models for phones and laptops AWS and Databricks to deliver more affordable generative AI for joint customers H2O.ai releases small language models for multimodal processing tasks LatticeFlow releases framework for checking LLMs’ compliance with the EU AI Act Google looks to spearhead AI adoption in the public sector DataStax merges its data stack with Nvidia’s development tools to simplify AI development and fine-tuning Adobe introduces new generative AI features for its creative applications Domino Data Lab seeks to embed governance in AI development Cognizant enhances Neuro AI platform for faster AI use case deployment OutSystems integrates generative AI with low-code to accelerate and simplify app development Big data startup UltiHash unveils advanced deduplication to boost AI storage efficiency Terray Therapeutics rakes in $120M for AI-powered small molecule drug development AI startups Decagon and Neuron7 raise millions to transform customer service and repairs AI observability firm Galileo raises $45M to improve AI model accuracy Omnea raises $25M to streamline procurement with AI French AI startup Gladia raises $16M and launches multilingual real-time transcription engine Data science and AI development platform Zerve raises $7.6M Simplismart raises $7M to help enterprises run their own AI models with rapid inference and full control Amplitude buys Command AI to help companies integrate AI-assisted onboarding and product tours into software There’s more AI and big data news on SiliconANGLE Completing the cloud nuclear trifecta after Microsoft last month announced it will tap into a reopened Three Mile Island: Google to buy nuclear energy from small modular reactor startup Kairos Power and Amazon to invest in three nuclear energy projects But these are all going to take years to produce energy, so it’s not going to solve the data center energy crunch anytime soon. At the Open Compute Project Global Summit in San Jose, which focuses on new technologies and standards for data centers, the talk was all about how AI is changing everything in the data center, and creating new problems to solve: * Does it seem hot in here?: If there’s one thing everyone’s freaking out about, it’s heat — specifically the heat generated by servers full of chips from Nvidia and other AI accelerator chipmakers. There were dozens of companies offering liquid-cooling solutions, considerably more than last year if I remember correctly. “You can no longer air-cool these servers,” said Saurabh Dighe, corporate VP for Microsoft Azure strategic planning and architecture. They need to be liquid-cooled.” * But AI chips aren’t the only source of heat. Copper wire works fine in individual data center racks, but with AI forcing more racks to be connected to tackle training of huge AI models, optical interconnects are becoming more and more critical — and those interconnects currently also take a lot of power and produce a lot of heat. “We need to get the power down,” said Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder and chief architect of Arista Networks. “We cannot change the laws of physics, but we can come up with better connectors.” That’s something established companies and startups such as Lightspeed are working hard to do. * Sustainability was the other, closely related byword at the summit. One standard being mulled is how to use “all that warm water from [cooling] data centers for more than just letting it evaporate in the air,” said Supermicro VP of Solutions Thomas Garvens. * But the problem with standards is that they take a lot of meetings and back-and-forth to establish. “Standards can take more time than we have in the era of AI,” said Google Principal Engineer Amber Huffman. * By the way, if it weren’t apparent already, networking looks to be the biggest bottleneck in the AI era. “The networking is essentially becoming the computer,” said Sameh Boujelgene of market researcher Dell’Oro Group. * ”Pigs can fly”: AMD EVP Forrest Norrod used that phrase to describe a deal between AMD and Intel to create an x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, which although not an OCP project was revealed onstage at the summit by Norrod and Intel EVP Justin Hotard. If Intel weren’t in such a hole, this never would have happened, given the decades of legal and market battles between the two. But if either of them wants to challenge Arm, whose designs are now powering data center chips for cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft, they need an instruction set as unified as Arm’s to ensure software compatibility among Intel and AMD chips and keep developers on the x86 train. Our story: Intel and AMD team up to improve the x86 processor architecture There was lots of other news, honestly a lot of pretty arcane stuff, but no surprise that Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang insists all data centers must become “AI factories,” captured so much attention: Nvidia aims to boost Blackwell GPUs by donating platform design to the Open Compute Project And this startup is betting big on one ginormous factory: Crusoe’s $3.4B joint venture to build AI data center campus with up to 100,000 GPUs Breaking Analysis: What Microsoft’s financial disclosures reveal about Azure’s market position And it may force other big companies to reveal more about their AI revenue. Private equity is bottom-fishing for software-as-a-service companies, which are increasingly being pressured by generative AI — not just because of investor interest but because chatbots have the potential to replace a good chunk of SaaS: Permira completes its $7.2B acquisition of Squarespace and Zuora to be acquired by Silverlake and GIC in $1.7B cash deal Intel reportedly seeking to sell minority stake in Altera at $17B valuation Lightmatter raises $400M at $4.4B valuation for next-gen photonic data center networking Xscape Photonics raises $44M to accelerate development of laser-based chip interconnects ASML shares plunge on lowered 2025 revenue forecast TSMC shares jump on expectation-topping third-quarter results Dialpad expands workforce management capabilities with Surfboard acquisition Developer tooling startup Port sails away with $35M in funding Everstage raises $30M to enhance sales performance management platform Lidar chip startup Lidwave closes $10M investment Clerk Chat raises $7M to simplify business text messaging VMware settles securities fraud class suit with $102.5M payout (per The Register) Salesforce launches customized financial services cloud platform for insurers HashiCorp debuts new Terraform Stacks and Vault updates at HashiConf 2024 Tableau Software updates data visualization and cloud analytics management SUSE enhances edge computing with new releases focused on scalability and efficiency Cato Networks expands SASE Cloud Platform with new Digital Experience Monitoring service Presidio expands AWS partnership to drive AI adoption and cloud migration We have more news on cloud, infrastructure and apps Google enhances security and management for corporate-owned Android devices Akamai introduces Behavioral DDoS Engine and AI Assistance to strengthen security portfolio Bitdefender’s new AI copilot works in real time to protect consumers from online scams Lookout adds ‘smishing’ and executive impersonation protection to mobile security platform Nametag launches ‘Deepfake Defense’ and expands Okta partnership to combat AI impersonation OneSpan introduces VISION FX for phishing-resistant banking security Tenable brings intelligent data and AI resource security risk management to the cloud Cyera acquires Trail Security for $162M to expand AI-powered data security platform DeNexus expands cyber risk management platform with $17.5M investment More cybersecurity news here Amazon refreshes its Kindle e-reader lineup with four new devices FTC makes canceling subscriptions less of a pain with ‘click to cancel’ rule Google files for emergency stay against Epic lawsuit it lost — and it gets it Sam Altman’s Worldcoin rebrands as World and launches updated iris-scanning Orb Stripe reportedly in talks to acquire fintech startup Bridge for $1B Blockstream raises $210M to boost bitcoin blockchain layer 2 scaling technology Path Robotics secures $100M Series D funding for its AI-enabled robotic welding technology IoT startup Monogoto raises $27M to accelerate its global expansion And check out more news on emerging tech, blockchain and crypto and policy Google reshuffles product leadership team and two AI units DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis gets the rest of Gemini, cementing his hold on all things AI at Google and elevating him to perhaps the No. 2 exec under Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

Title: ‘I really enjoy the journey of it all’: Lacken lad Caelan Doris would make ideal Lions king

It will be another six months before Andy Farrell finally has to choose his British & Irish Lions captain for the 2025 expedition to Australia. Plenty of time for the landscape to change and, theoretically, for one or two surprise contenders to emerge from the shrubbery. Until, that is, you sit down with the staggeringly impressive Caelan Doris and realise there is little need for Farrell to look anywhere else. A bold prediction? Hardly. It is not rocket science that a world-class player with the universal respect of his peers, a university degree in psychology and a warm smile might just fit the bill. Ireland have produced some illustrious Lions captains in the pro era, from Brian O’Driscoll to Paul O’Connell and Peter O’Mahony, and another top-drawer candidate lurks quietly in the wings. Because whether or not he is confirmed, as most anticipate, on Wednesday as Ireland’s skipper for the upcoming November Tests, the 26-year-old Leinster back-rower is every coach’s dream. Even on a damp Tuesday morning he is already eyeing the next big challenge, batteries recharged and eyes gleaming after last Saturday’s win over Munster in front of 80,468 spectators at Croke Park. “You just kind of get into the zone. I don’t think I’m crazy aggressive; I’d say I’m relatively consistent on and off the pitch. But of course you’re competitive and want to play on the edge and win.” Alongside the footwork, physicality and footballing nous that make him such an effective number eight, however, Doris is no ordinary jock. The son of two psychoanalysts – his maternal grandfather Michael Sweetman was a prominent industrialist and political figure who tragically died in the Staines air crash in 1972 – he might have pursued a very different career. Or maybe not, given what he found when he returned to his native Co Mayo this summer. “I was back home in June, flicking through some old stuff, and found a book I’d made when I was making my Holy Communion at the age of 10 or 11. It had a page for future ambitions and where I wanted to live. On it was written, ‘I want to be a rugby or a football player’. That was kind of cool because I don’t remember that being something I was going after.” The follow-up entry – “I want to have a house in Mayo, London and New York” – also prompted some amusement. “I’ll be a while playing rugby if I want to do that.” To understand the real Doris, even so, you need to understand Lacken, where he grew up. The post office and the shop were sad casualties of Covid but the area remains close to his heart. “It’s beautiful. On a good day it’s hard to beat. My parents are still based there and I get back when I can. “It’s very rural ... I think there’s about 500 people in the parish. It’s about 10 minutes to the closest village and 20 minutes to the closest town. At my primary school, which was walking distance from where I grew up, there were 30 to 35 pupils in the whole school across eight years. In my year, I only had one other classmate.” Fortunately he and his solitary companion, David, became good friends but the 12-year-old Doris subsequently leapt at the chance to board at Blackrock College. Perhaps his genes would have propelled him into the national squad anyway but he thinks otherwise. “I’m more of a nurture over nature guy. Of course there’s a genetic element of it but I’d have had a rugby ball or a Gaelic football in hand from a very early age. We had a pretty big garden and lived by a school with a pitch so there was always something going on. Then you go to Blackrock, which is a massive rugby school. I loved it from the start.” He has been on a steep upward trajectory ever since. The 6ft 4in forward captained Ireland under-20s in 2018, made his Leinster debut in the same year and won the first of his 44 senior Ireland caps in 2020 under the captaincy of Johnny Sexton, whom he’d grown up admiring from afar. “It was strange initially. There was a bit of impostor syndrome: ‘What the hell am I doing in the same dressingroom as this guy?’” [ How to overcome impostor syndrome: ‘It affects high achievers who feel unworthy’Opens in new window ] Now, suddenly, Sexton has retired and Doris, who was in Cardiff this week to promote this year’s Investec Champions Cup, is fast becoming a similar talisman for Leinster and Ireland. He led the national side for the first time against Italy in February and was appointed Leinster’s captain last month. The mental side of the game – “It’s definitely an area I’m interested in ….” – fascinates him, as does the potential for captaincy to enhance his growth as a player and a person. “I want to get the best out of myself from a playing and a human perspective. If there’s extra responsibility ... it allows you to increase your capacity.” This includes his inner self. “Anything from being more open with friends and family or getting things off my chest or sharing something with someone. I do weekly therapy sessions and mindfulness to fill up the tank.” Sea swimming and saunas are other regular pastimes. “I’ve also started doing a bit of hot yoga recently, which I’ve enjoyed. It all just gives you a bit of balance and calm.” He will need plenty of both if a high-profile Lions role does come. As a kid, Doris remembers accompanying his father, Chris, to a local village pub at breakfast time to cheer on the Lions in 2005 and 2009 and Australia 2025 has long been on his bucket list. “It’s a pretty special thing isn’t it? It’s definitely a goal. There’s a lot of rugby to be played before then for Leinster and Ireland. But, yeah, I would absolutely love to be on the tour.” Before that, of course, comes next month’s looming reunion with the All Blacks, the first meeting of the sides since last year’s fateful World Cup quarter-final. That anniversary fell this week but Doris is more focused on embracing the next phase of his career. “Of course there are hard days, but there are so many good ones as well,” he said. “I really enjoy the journey of it all: the craic with the lads, the friendships, the travel, the opportunities. I’m trying to soak it all in.” The country boy from Lacken would make a cracking Lion king. – Guardian © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Will This Bull Market Ever End? – September Dividend Income Report
URL: https://thedividendguyblog.com/will-this-bull-market-ever-end/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T14:41:34Z

The Dividend Guy Blog Unconventional Lifestyle and Dividend Growth Strategy Blog, Dividend Income Report / October 18, 2024 by DivGuy / Leave a Comment In 2016, I made a life-changing decision: I took a sabbatical, put my family in a small RV, and drove to Costa Rica. Upon my return in 2017, I officially quit my job as a private banker at National Bank and started working full-time on my baby: Dividend Stocks Rock. I also decided to manage my pension account held at the National Bank. I’ve built this portfolio publicly since 2017 to make a real-life case study. I decided to invest 100% of this money in dividend growth stocks. In August 2017, I received $108,760.02 in a locked retirement account. This means I can’t add capital to the account, and growth is only generated through capital gains and dividends. I don’t report this portfolio’s results to brag about my returns or to tell you to follow my lead. I just want to share how I manage my portfolio monthly with all the good and the bad. I hope you can learn from my experience. Last month, I covered why BCE is dead to me. This time, let’s also look at our never-ending bull market and what could happen next. Let’s start with the numbers as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): Original amount invested in September 2017 (no additional capital added): $108,760.02. Total return since inception (Sep 2017 – October 2024): 160.33% Annualized return (since September 2017 – 84 months): 14.65% SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 14.53% (total return 158.50%) iShares S&P/TSX 60 ETF (XIU.TO) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 10.42% (total return 100.10%) It seems that each time I review my portfolio, I cross a new all-time high. On one side, I’m glad I’m always 100% invested as I fully benefit from the bull markets. On the other hand, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow when I look at the current state of the market. This will not change my strategy, but I seriously think we are due for a market correction. Having said that, I would still invest all my money in the stock market if I had received my pension account last summer instead of doing it seven years ago. In the end, it doesn’t matter what I think will happen in the market in the next 12 months, as time in the market is more important than timing the market. Now, the S&P 500 is up by more than 20% since the beginning of the year, and the TSX is not far behind at +16% (including dividends). When investors ask if it’s time to invest in the stock market because interest rates are finally going down this year, I answer that the market started banking this information 12 months ago. This is what I was telling you in this monthly report back in November 2023. On the U.S. side, I was surprised that the utility sector surged more than all the others (+31.56% so far this year). The communication sector, led by tech giants Alphabet and Meta, is second, while the financial industry closes the top 3 best-performing sectors using SPDR spiders ETFs. Of course, this is not perfect, as ETFs can play around with stock allocation for each sector, but it gives a good idea of what is going on. You won’t be surprised to find the consumer discretionary sector last, offering a return of about half of the S&P 500 (around 10%). It seems it’s the only sector warning us that a recession could happen as many companies struggle to report sales and profit growth, claiming customers are stuck with tight budgets. When I look at the BMO ETFs tracking a mix of Canadian and U.S. stocks, I come to a similar conclusion about the consumer discretionary sector. It’s a tough ride if you are exposed to this sector. Still, everything is in positive territory with a strong rebound from the energy sector leading the pack with communications (BMO includes Alphabet and Meta in their ETF too). Despite concerns about the economy, Canadian Banks are doing quite well! Even ScotiaBank is performing well in 2024! If you are looking for “undervalued” stocks, the best sectors seem to be consumer discretionary and REITs (potentially utilities in Canada, too). Those sectors have taken a good hit since the rise in interest rates, and the recovery is not complete for many companies. Investing during all-time highs is always tricky as we fear a market crash. However, focusing on quality (read strong financial fundamentals) will always be a winning strategy. And let’s be honest, it’s a lot easier to select quality companies than predict where the market may be in 6 months! Should you want to add some stocks to your portfolio, I have shared my Top Underrated Dividend Growers on my YouTube channel. It includes my analysis of LeMaitre Vascular (LMAT), one of my holdings. Watch it below: Slowly but surely, the portfolio is taking shape with 11 companies spread across 7 sectors. My goal is to build a portfolio generating 4-5% in yield across 15 positions. I will continue to add new stocks monthly until I reach that goal. My current yield is 4.47%. I used my $500 contribution to buy more Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO). The stock has dropped about 20% from its peak value due to the weakness in oil prices. That’s a good time to buy more of what always works! I’ve covered CNQ’s recent drop in this podcast episode: I will likely sell my shares of CWB in the coming months since the play worked out perfectly, and I can move my money into another stock and it will help reduce my exposure to the financial sector. Here’s my SM portfolio as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): Let’s look at my CDN portfolio. Numbers are as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): My account shows a variation of +$2,777.13 (+2.54%) since September’s income report. We are at the end of a quarter and I’ll start reviewing U.S. companies’ earnings in my next portfolio update. Here’s my US portfolio now. Numbers are as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): My account shows a variation of +$5,894.06 (+4.89%) since September’s income report. Each quarter we run an exclusive report for Dividend Stocks Rock (DSR) members who subscribe to our very special additional service called DSR PRO. The PRO report includes a summary of each company’s earnings report for the period. We have been doing this for an entire year now and I wanted to share my own DSR PRO report for this portfolio. You can download the full PDF showing all the information about all my holdings. Results have been updated as of October 4th, 2024. Download my portfolio Q3 2024 report. It’s great to see a steady dividend increase over the past few months. I’ve performed a few transactions over the past 18 months such as selling Enbridge and Magna International, and my portfolio still pays more dividends now than ever. It’s great that most of my holdings have increased their dividends in the mid to high single-digits! It’s a great sign that my portfolio is healthy. Dividend growth (over the past 12 months): Canadian Holding payouts: $393.46 CAD. U.S. Holding payouts: $228.10 USD. Total payouts: $702.22 CAD. *I used a USD/CAD conversion rate of 1.3536 Since I started this portfolio in September 2017, I have received a total of $27,912.93 CAD in dividends. Keep in mind that this is a “pure dividend growth portfolio,” as no capital can be added to this account other than retained and/or reinvested dividends. Therefore, all dividend growth is coming from the stocks and not from any additional capital being added to the account. You may have noticed that I hold over $1,000 in cash across my US and Canadian accounts. This liquidity will soon be used to increase my position in Toromont Industries (TIH.TO) since it’s my smallest holding. I haven’t moved yet because I’ve been busy with other stuff! I don’t expect to make any other trades by the end of the year unless one of my top holdings breaks the 10% barrier of all my portfolios (hello, Apple!). Cheers, Mike.

Title: The Dow drops nearly 200 points as Netflix boosts the Nasdaq

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 160 points on Friday morning, while other major stock indexes rose, partly driven by Netflix’s strong earnings report. After the opening bell, the Dow fell 162 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite popped up 0.6%. Video streaming could have been the end of TV commercials, but now even Netflix (NFLX+11.12%) is making its advertising business a “priority.” This comes as the streaming giant shifts its focus from subscriber growth to profit. Netflix (NFLX+11.12%) stock rose more than 10% Friday morning following an impressive earnings report Thursday. It added more than five million paid subscribers in the third quarter of 2024, outperforming Wall Street expectations of 3.5 million. CVS Health (CVS-5.26%) announced a change in its chief executive officer and cautioned that its upcoming earnings are likely to disappoint predictions from Wall Street, leading to a more than 7% drop in shares during early trading. David Joyner has been appointed president and CEO and will assume the role on Oct. 17. He will be succeeding Karen Lynch. Joyner, who has nearly four decades of experience in the health care sector, was previously the executive vice president and president of CVS Caremark. He has also held pivotal roles at Aetna, one of the company’s currently struggling divisions. Joyner will join the Board, while current chairman Roger Farah takes on the role of executive chairman. — Francisco Velasquez and Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Title: Klaviyo stock target lifted, overweight on growth prospects
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/klaviyo-stock-target-lifted-overweight-on-growth-prospects-93CH-3671056
Time Published: 2024-10-18T13:17:45Z
Full Content:
On Friday, Piper Sandler, a financial services firm, updated its outlook on shares of Klaviyo Inc (NYSE:NYSE:KVYO), raising the price target to $45.00 from the previous $34.00. The firm sustained its Overweight rating on the company's stock. The revision reflects a positive view of the company's growth trajectory, as Klaviyo's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is expected to surpass $1 billion, with an anticipated growth rate of over 28% year-over-year at the end of the year. Klaviyo's platform, which provides marketing tools that leverage data to enhance revenue streams through various channels like SMS, e-mail, and mobile push, is currently used by more than 151,000 retail brands. Notable clients include Vuori, Unilever (LON:ULVR), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT). The analyst noted that new features and integrations with platforms such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Canva, TikTok, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) could significantly impact sales during the upcoming Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) season. The company's international prospects are also looking up, with planned expansions in language support. Presently supporting English and French, Klaviyo aims to include German, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and Portuguese to cater to a broader global customer base. This move is expected to bolster the company's international expansion efforts in the following year. Piper Sandler expressed increased confidence in Klaviyo's ability to maintain a growth rate of over 25% and achieve a 10% or higher operating margin model. The updated price target of $45 is indicative of this optimism and the potential that the financial services firm sees in the company's strategic initiatives and market position. In other recent news, Klaviyo's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives have attracted attention. Klaviyo's revenue exceeded forecasts by $10 million, and operating profits rose by 65% year over year. Several analyst firms, including Baird and Benchmark, have reacted positively to these developments. Baird raised its price target for Klaviyo shares in anticipation of a strong third-quarter earnings report. Benchmark initiated coverage of Klaviyo's shares with a Buy rating, emphasizing the company's strategic integration of various marketing technologies. Moreover, KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded Klaviyo's stock to Overweight due to the company's strong growth trajectory. Barclays and TD Cowen also displayed confidence in Klaviyo's growth prospects, upgrading the stock rating to overweight and maintaining a Buy rating, respectively. In addition to its financial performance, Klaviyo has announced a partnership with TikTok to integrate its customer segmentation tools with the social media platform. This move is expected to enhance ad targeting and improve relationships with potential buyers. These are just some of the recent developments that have kept Klaviyo in the spotlight. Klaviyo's strong market position and growth potential, as highlighted by Piper Sandler's upgraded price target, are further supported by real-time data from InvestingPro. The company's revenue growth remains robust, with a 38.38% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, and a 35.01% quarterly growth in Q2 2024. This aligns with the analyst's expectations of continued strong growth. InvestingPro Tips reveal that Klaviyo holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid financial foundation to support its expansion plans. Additionally, nine analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting growing confidence in the company's near-term performance. The stock's recent performance has been particularly noteworthy, with a strong 49.38% return over the last three months and a substantial 63.93% return over the past six months. This momentum has pushed the stock to trade near its 52-week high, with the current price at 98.06% of that peak. While these metrics paint a positive picture, investors should note that Klaviyo is currently trading at a high revenue valuation multiple and is not yet profitable over the last twelve months. However, analysts predict the company will become profitable this year, which could be a significant catalyst for the stock. For readers interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for Klaviyo, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: AWS CEO Matt Garman says employees could quit if they don't want to come into office
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/aws-ceo-matt-garman-says-employees-could-quit-if-they-dont-want-to-come-into-office/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T13:02:01Z
Full Content:
Amazon AWS CEO Matt Garman has said that employees who don't want to abide by the new rules coming into force next year, which will see workers come in for five days a week, can resign. Garman didn't seem to be saying it in an antagonistic way, just that some people may not work well in the new environment, and if not, there are always other companies around that will let you work from home. Garman made the remarks yesterday during an all-hands meeting. He said that 90% of employees he had spoken to were on board with the new policy, according to a transcript seen by Reuters. He was quoted as saying: "If there are people who just don't work well in that environment and don't want to, that's okay, there are other companies around. By the way, I don't mean that in a bad way, we want to be in an environment where we're working together. When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we're not in person." As you'd expect, not everyone at the company is thrilled about the idea of spending extra time commuting. Some people point to the fact that the benefits of working in the office aren't supported by independent data. Since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has been running a three-day-in-the-office policy where workers go into work for just three days a week. Garman said that the switch to being in the office five days a week will eliminate the issue of missing colleagues if they choose to work on different days. Going into the office five days a week is pretty much a return to the situation before the pandemic. Amazon believes that workers will get more done in the office so it's eager to get back to that. As many tech firms are doing layoffs, it will be unlikely that many people quit their Amazon jobs over this issue as it may be hard to get another job.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs break $20 billion in inflows as BTC aims ATH

Time Published: 2024-10-18T12:30:17Z

BTC ETFs achieve record inflows in months, a feat that took Gold ETFs years to achieve. Spot Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued to shatter records and defy expectations. In a remarkable development, cumulative total net inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded the $20 billion mark for the first time since its launch in January. This record level was achieved following a massive influx of $1.5 billion in just four days. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, highlighted the significance of this milestone on X (formerly Twitter). He stated, “The most imp number, most difficult metric to grow in ETF world.” He further compared it to gold ETFs, noting that: “It took gold ETFs about 5yrs to reach same number.” It is worth noting that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has been a major contributor to these inflows. Data reported by SoSo Value revealed that on the 17th of October, BTC Spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $470 million. Out of which, IBIT led the way with an impressive $309 million. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ETF ARKB followed with a net inflow of $100 million. Source: SoSo Value As a result of these inflows, the total assets in spot Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $64 billion. On the 16th of October, IBIT experienced a substantial net inflow of $393.4 million, marking its largest inflow since July. At press time, BlackRock’s net assets stood at over $25 billion. The product accounted for 1.95% of the entire Bitcoin market share of $1.3 trillion. The surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs wasn’t the only bright spot this week. The cryptocurrency market has brought the long-awaited ‘Uptober’ rally to life. After briefly dipping to around $58,000 on the 10th of October, BTC skyrocketed to a high of over $68,000 in just six days. Over the past week, it rallied by double digits, gaining approximately 12%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,786, just 8% shy of its all-time high (ATH) of over $73,000. Consequently, optimism has been growing among traders, with many speculating that this bull cycle could propel Bitcoin to new highs. The combination of bullish sentiment and a potential supply shock has sparked renewed enthusiasm and interest in the asset, suggesting the rally may be far from over. While the king coin remains the largest cryptocurrency by market value, it has also managed to secure its spot among the top monetary assets. According to CompaniesMarketCap, Bitcoin now ranks as the 10th largest monetary asset globally. This achievement highlights Bitcoin’s growing influence not just in digital assets, but also in global financial markets.

Title: American Express Q3 Earnings: Profit Beats Estimate, Card Spending Grows, Revises Annual Outlook

American Express Co’s (NYSE:AXP) third-quarter revenue (net of interest expense) grew 8% year-on-year to $16.64 billion, marginally missing the analyst consensus estimate of $16.67 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, increased Card Member spending, and continued strong card fee growth. Amex’s stock price went up after the report, but it soon gave up the gains in the premarket session on Friday. Also Read: Citigroup Remains A Compelling Investment Opportunity: Analysts Take On Q3 Performance Adjusted EPS of $3.49 beat the analyst consensus estimate of $3.28. Card Member spending or Billed Business grew 6% (or 6% forex adjusted) year-over-year to $387.3 billion. U.S. Consumer Services revenue was $7.944 billion, up 10% year over year. Commercial Services revenue was $3.998 billion, up 7% year over year. International Card Services revenue was $2.936 billion, up 11% year over year, and Global Merchant and Network Services revenue was $1.847 billion, flat year over year. Total expenses increased by 9% year over year to $12.1 billion, primarily reflecting higher customer engagement costs due to higher Card Member spending, increased usage of travel-related benefits, and higher marketing investments. Provision for credit losses stood at $1.4 billion, compared with $1.2 billion a year ago, reflecting higher net write-offs. FY24 Outlook: Amex expects revenue growth of 9% or $65.96 billion (versus prior expectations of 9%–11% or $65.96 billion–$67.17 billion) versus consensus of $65.97 billion. It has raised its EPS outlook to $13.75–$14.05 (from $13.30–$13.80 prior) versus the consensus of $13.14. In August, B of A Securities analyst Kenneth Bruce downgraded American Express, citing continued inflation and the higher rate environment affecting consumer demand. He did not expect the company to deliver its previously guided 9%- 11% revenue growth for fiscal 2024. At least 3 Wall Street firms, including JP Morgan, HSBC, and BTIG, downgraded the stock in October. American Express stock is up 89% in the last 12 months. Price Action: AXP stock is down 2.79% at $277.80 premarket at the last check on Friday.

U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week; Netflix (NFLX) shares are surging after the streaming giant grew subscribers and beat analysts' estimates; CVS Health (CVS) shares are tumbling after it replaced its CEO; Apple (AAPL) shares are moving higher on strong iPhone 16 sales in China; and Nvidia (NVDA) stock continues to climb after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) earnings showed strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week, with the Nasdaq rising by 0.5% as Netflix (NFLX) helps lead tech stocks higher. The S&P 500 also is edging higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is little changed after closing Thursday at a record high for the third time this week. Crude oil futures are lower, while gold futures are higher. Treasury yields are edging higher, with the 10-year's rising to around 4.1%. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after it posted gains on the top and bottom lines that beat analysts' expectations. Netflix's 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $9.83 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 both came in better than consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The streaming giant also reported a 14% increase in subscribers to 282.72 million, just above expectations, and projected that its annual revenue would grow by 15%, at the higher end of its previously announced range. CVS Health (CVS) stock is tumbling 12% in premarket trading after the pharmacy and healthcare giant announced the replacement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karen Lynch with David Joyner, a longtime company veteran who most recently ran Caremark, its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). CVS also provided preliminary guidance for third-quarter profit, projecting earnings per share (EPS) between 3 cents and 8 cents, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10, well below expectations of $1.27 and $1.69, respectively. The news comes after CVS Health reportedly has been considering breaking up its retail pharmacies and Aetna health insurance operations. Sales of Apple's (AAPL) newly launched iPhone 16 in China are 20% better than those of its previous model, with sales of its top-end phones improving by 44%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited three weeks of data from Counterpoint Research on iPhone 16 sales from its September release, comparing them with sales from the same time period after Apple's iPhone 15 release. Shares of Apple are roughly 2% higher in premarket trading as they near record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are continuing to climb in premarket trading after the chipmaker touched an all-time intraday high yesterday. Nvidia's shares rose on the strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which showed that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products remained strong. Nvidia shares are 1% higher while TSMC shares are dipping by 0.5%.

U.S. stock futures are pointing mostly higher to end the week, with the Nasdaq rising by 0.5% as Netflix (NFLX) helps lead tech stocks higher. The S&P 500 also is edging higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is little changed after closing Thursday at a record high for the third time this week. Crude oil futures are lower, while gold futures are higher. Treasury yields are edging higher, with the 10-year's rising to around 4.1%. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are jumping by more than 6% in premarket trading after it posted gains on the top and bottom lines that beat analysts' expectations. Netflix's 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $9.83 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 both came in better than consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The streaming giant also reported a 14% increase in subscribers to 282.72 million, just above expectations, and projected that its annual revenue would grow by 15%, at the higher end of its previously announced range. CVS Health (CVS) stock is tumbling 12% in premarket trading after the pharmacy and healthcare giant announced the replacement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Karen Lynch with David Joyner, a longtime company veteran who most recently ran Caremark, its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). CVS also provided preliminary guidance for third-quarter profit, projecting earnings per share (EPS) between 3 cents and 8 cents, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.10, well below expectations of $1.27 and $1.69, respectively. The news comes after CVS Health reportedly has been considering breaking up its retail pharmacies and Aetna health insurance operations. Sales of Apple's (AAPL) newly launched iPhone 16 in China are 20% better than those of its previous model, with sales of its top-end phones improving by 44%, according to a Bloomberg report. The report cited three weeks of data from Counterpoint Research on iPhone 16 sales from its September release, comparing them with sales from the same time period after Apple's iPhone 15 release. Shares of Apple are roughly 2% higher in premarket trading as they near record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are continuing to climb in premarket trading after the chipmaker touched an all-time intraday high yesterday. Nvidia's shares rose on the strong earnings report from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), which showed that demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products remained strong. Nvidia shares are 1% higher while TSMC shares are dipping by 0.5%.

Title: Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): ‘How Can You Have A Bull Birthday Party Without Inviting Meta?’

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Best Performers List: 12 Stocks Cramer is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other best performers on Jim Cramer's list. On a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. He mentioned that this particular bull market has been quiet and gentle, which he attributes to the unusual circumstances surrounding its rise. “The whole first year of this bull’s life was an anomaly. That’s because the Fed was furiously tightening and the market went up anyway,” Cramer explained. He emphasized that for the past two years, opportunities have been evident, stating, “Every night I say there’s always a bull market somewhere, and for the last two years, well, it’s been right in front of you.” Cramer then went on to discuss the lead performing stocks and ended the segment, saying: “The bottom line, if you're going to buy these stocks, I’d go first with Nvidia, then with Broadcom, and finally Fair Isaac, if only because we need something that's not connected to the data center, even as we know, it will remain a strong story for the ages.” Cramer also advised investors to shift their focus away from the consumer price index (CPI) report, suggesting that its significance has diminished since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates. “We had to be concerned about this stuff when the Fed was on the warpath, either raising rates or leaving them higher for longer. Now, though, the Fed is your friend, so I wouldn't obsess about the details.” He did emphasize, however, that the monthly labor report remains important in the current climate. He remarked on the tendency for many to become “Fed watchers,” suggesting that this reliance on government data can detract from the deeper analysis of individual companies. Cramer referenced Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, who advised against an overemphasis on CPI data, as the Fed is unlikely to base decisions on it. Cramer explained: “When the Fed's raising rates in order to stamp out inflation, it can be very important. When we're in a rate hike cycle, you're trying to figure out when that's going to end. But we're not in that kind of cycle anymore. We're in a rate cutting cycle.” Cramer explained that last month the Fed implemented a double rate cut, setting a downward trend that is expected to continue. He added: “Sure, if we had a huge spike in the CPI this morning, then maybe the Fed would change its stance. But that would have to be an extreme reading. And there's nothing extreme about today's 2.4% inflation number, just a tick above the expected 2.3, still down from the 2.5% reading from the prior month.” Cramer concluded with a strong reminder about the nature of investing. “Forget the macro, people. It’s not that meaningful when the Fed’s cutting rates. And keep your eyes on the prize: Earnings,” he urged. Ultimately, he reinforced that earnings dictate stock prices in the long run, and that’s where the focus should be for those looking to make money in the market. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks with the biggest gains over the past 2 years that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Cramer mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in his list of stocks with the biggest gains. He emphasized Mark Zuckerberg's assertion that future ad campaigns will focus on Instagram and Reels and said: “Honestly, how can you have a bull birthday party without inviting Meta, without inviting Mark Zuckerberg? I would never think of it. His last conference call told you a tale that made it sound like all ad campaigns will soon start on Instagram and reels. Am I going to doubt this fella? No. He has the AI to design the most effective targeted ads and you don't need to hire an advertising agency. Much better return on investment.” It is a leading technology company that focuses on creating products designed to facilitate connections and sharing among users through a variety of devices, including mobile phones, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. The financial performance of Meta (NASDAQ:META) has been remarkable over the years, largely driven by the ongoing shift toward digital advertising. As the global digital advertising market is expected to expand from $366 billion in 2022 to over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. With nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its platforms, the company generates significant advertising revenue. In its most recent quarterly report, Meta (NASDAQ:META) recorded an impressive $38.3 billion in ad revenue and a 22% increase in overall revenue compared to the previous year. The growth is particularly noteworthy given the scale of the company, which points to a strong demand for its advertising capabilities. Overall META ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of best performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Amazon boss has a brutal response to staffers who don’t like 5-day RTO mandate: Leave
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/amazon-matt-garman-return-to-office-mandate/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Amazon’s push to get employees back into the office five days a week is boiling down to a rather blunt argument: If staffers don’t like it, they can work elsewhere. At an all-hands meeting for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, CEO Matt Garman bluntly told colleagues that if they didn’t like the controversial policy, they should leave. The tech giant’s push to get employees back to their in-office desks five days a week hasn’t been simple. In February last year, some 16,000 employees joined a Slack channel and launched a petition to oppose CEO Andy Jassy’s call to return to the office for “the majority of the week.” In February 2023, that meant only three days a week, but by September 2024, it was increased to mandatory in-office attendance every day of the working week starting from January 2025. In an internal call this week—first reported by Reuters—Garman doubled down on the decision, saying Amazon didn’t want employees who couldn’t handle being in the office that frequently. “If there are people who just don’t work well in that environment and don’t want to, that’s okay, there are other companies around,” Garman said, per Reuters. “By the way, I don’t mean that in a bad way,” he continued. He said he wanted staff to be “in an environment where we’re working together.” Garman said he isn’t seeing enough evidence to support the idea that the Jeff Bezos–founded company is innovating fast enough under a hybrid working model, adding: “When we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we’re not in-person.” Given the fact that teams were in for three days—and not necessarily the same three days—“we didn’t really accomplish anything, like, we didn’t get to work together and learn from each other,” Garman reportedly added. Amazon did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. According to a transcript of the all-hands seen by CNBC, Garman insisted that of the colleagues he has spoken to, “nine out of 10” are looking forward to the new mandate being enforced. Perhaps Garman has just been lucky with the people he has spoken to, as staffers posting on social media sites and internal channels have expressed their fury at the goalposts once again changing—impacting their commute and family dynamics. “Amazon has announced 5-day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer posted on LinkedIn with an accompanying #OpenToWork banner signaling their intention to leave the company. “If you have remote opportunities available, please message me,” the staffer continued. “Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.” Tech staffers looking to leave Amazon for a rival face uncertain prospects, with layoffs sweeping through companies offering a more flexible office-to-hybrid working structure. Meta, for example, allows its staff to work from home two days a week, and Google has a similar policy. Microsoft on the other hand allows staff to work as flexibly as they want, with a VP at the company recently telling staffers the policy will stay in place as long as productivity remains high. Amazon’s culture is very closely linked to its leadership principles, many of which hark back to the days when billionaire entrepreneur Bezos was at the helm. Current CEO Andy Jassy is still a proponent of the principles, with Garman reportedly adding that teams not being together, in-person and full-time, is getting in the way of these guiding ideas. Speaking of the leadership principles, Garman is reported to have said: “You can’t internalize them by reading them on the website, you really have to experience them day-to-day.” Along with well-known ideas like Amazon’s “customer obsession,” there is the notion of disagree and commit, where individuals voice their opinions but join the general consensus whether or not they agree. “I don’t know if you guys have tried to disagree via a Chime call,” Garman continued, referring to an internal messaging platform. “It’s very hard.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

[+] bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin. "Excess government spending is driving America to bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter. Musk's post quoted an anonymous finance account that had said "$500 billion was added to the national debt in just the last 3 weeks," adding: "The government is out of control." Meanwhile, speaking during a town hall meeting in Folsom, Pennsylvania, Musk warned inflation could again spiral out of control as a result of "crazy" government spending. "The Federal government is spending America into bankruptcy ... and that's what really leads to inflation ... when the government spends more than it brings in," Musk said, calling it a "pernicious" tax. "We have to radically reduce the amount of government spending so we don't rack up a government debt that's impossible to repay and we don't drive the country to bankruptcy," Musk said. 10/20 update: Elon Musk has continued to warn that U.S. spending is spiraling out of control, posting to X that "this needs to stop." "The U.S. Treasury—your tax dollars—are being wasted at a staggering rate," Musk posted, quoting a post by a political action committee (PAC) founded by Musk that claimed "half a trillion dollars has been added to the National Debt in the in the past 3 weeks." "Wasteful spending is out of control in this country," the America PAC posted, adding "a Department of Government Efficiency is desperately needed." Musk has agreed to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency that has been suggested by former U.S. president and Republican candidate Donald Trump, calling it Doge—a reference to the meme that's also the basis of the dogecoin cryptocurrency. Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024.

Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by "persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar," according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade. "Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin," JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch.

Title: Google’s search and ads chief is out

Good morning. I was delighted to learn recently that Winamp, the free audio player of choice for a certain demographic (cough) of Windows users at the turn of the millennium, soldiers on to this day. Apparently “tens of millions” of users still fire it up on a regular basis, according to its Belgian owner—hopefully still with skins that look like an aftermarket head unit from a ‘96 Mitsubishi Eclipse. The name of Winamp’s owner, by the way? Llama Group. Which really whips…ah, nevermind. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. It’s big news, even for big tech: Prabhakar Raghavan, the most senior Google executive overseeing search and advertising, is leaving his gig. He spent four years leading the company’s core business. Raghavan isn’t leaving Google; he’ll become its chief technologist. “He’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence,” CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a staff memo. Why the change? Likely because Google’s cash cow is under assault. (And parent company Alphabet, for all its divisions, is still largely driven by that cash cow.) Artificial intelligence assistants threaten to replace search as the leading destination for information and antitrust regulators have taken the company’s primary moneymaker to task. Nick Fox, a long-serving search executive, will replace Raghavan (and immediately occupy the “who will succeed Sundar” seat), with two caveats: The team overseeing Google’s Gemini generative assistant will move out of Raghavan’s former org and into Google DeepMind, and the team overseeing Google Assistant will join the group that handles the Android mobile operating system. Watch this space. —AN No one said the AI wars wouldn’t get heated. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff took to social media yesterday to put rival Microsoft on blast for its “disappointing” AI-powered assistant, Copilot. “It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy,” he wrote. “Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess.” (Salesforce, naturally, has been promoting its own AI-powered agent called Einstein. Ahem.) It’s not the first time Benioff has taken a swing at Copilot. He called the tool “the new Clippy,” in a dig at Microsoft’s memorable 1990s feature, in a television interview a month ago. Why the war footing? Because Salesforce needs to win mindshare against its more entrenched peers. Microsoft is able to win customers simply by deploying Copilot across its Office business suite as well as developer favorite GitHub; same deal for Google and Gemini. Salesforce may be tops in customer relationship management software—its ticker is CRM for a reason—but its peers are far bigger. Just remember, Marc: Coffee is for closers. —AN If 2023 was Meta’s “Year of Efficiency” then how come it’s still going on in late 2024? According to The Verge, the company is laying off staffers as it reorganizes teams in its WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs units. Meta says the aim is “to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy.” So, nothing to do with Meta’s eye-watering capital expenditure in the AI race, then. But it’s not just Meta. Intel, which is struggling because of multiple reasons including the AI chip race, let go more than 2,000 employees in the U.S. this week. And Nokia, the telecommunications equipment maker, just announced over 2,000 job cuts in China, where life becomes ever harder for Western businesses. It’s not clear how many Meta employees are affected by the latest cuts there, but the figure’s unlikely to be in the same ballpark. In 2018, Zuora was on top of the world. The business software company had just gone public on the New York Stock Exchange. Founder and CEO Tien Tzuo had published a philosophical book called Subscribed. Seemingly everything was moving to a subscription-based business model—music to the ears of a company built to launch and manage such things. It’s been tough sledding in the years since. Revenue growth has proven steady but unspectacular. Rounds of layoffs have been demoralizing, even if they’ve kept the company’s profits in line. And the company’s stock has been hovering below $10 a share, making it a prime acquisition target. The winning suitors? None other than private equity firm Silver Lake and Singaporean wealth fund GIC. The pair announced Thursday that they will pick up Zuora for what amounts to $1.7 billion, a 6.2% premium, when the deal closes in early 2025. In theory, going private will allow Zuora to reverse its recent slowdown and better compete with billing rivals SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce. At least that’s what its new owners, uh, subscribe to. —AN It’s a win for the hearing impaired everywhere. The Federal Communications Commission approved new regulations on Thursday that require phonemakers to make their devices compatible with hearing aids, and vice versa. The rule includes recently approved over-the-counter hearing aids, which includes Apple’s “clinical grade” AirPods Pro 2. The FCC didn’t stop there. The federal agency approved a regulation that requires all new mobile handsets sold in the U.S. to allow users to raise the volume without introducing distortion. It also rolled out mandates that phone labels at point of sale include hearing aid compatibility. After a transition period, “Americans with hearing loss will no longer be limited…in the mobile handset marketplace,” the FCC said. To which we say: Heard. —AN —Stripe sniffs around a crypto stablecoin acquisition. The purported price? One billion dollars. —Netflix ad-tier subscribers jump 35%. It beat estimates—barely—in its latest quarter. —Automattic CEO tells staff: Loose lips sink ships. Nearly 160 take a buyout as the company wades through deepening legal drama. —FBI arrests suspect in SEC social media hack. The stunt drove up Bitcoin’s price by $1,000. —Permira takes Squarespace private for $7.2b. It also sold Tock, a foodie favorite, to American Express. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Citi maintains Neutral rating on NFLX stock
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/citi-maintains-neutral-rating-on-nflx-stock-93CH-3670531
Time Published: 2024-10-18T10:25:47Z

Citi has maintained its Neutral rating on Netflix (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:NFLX), with a steady price target of $675.00. The streaming giant's third-quarter financial results surpassed market expectations, with a reported revenue approximately 1% higher than Wall Street forecasts and an operating income that was 7% above consensus. Netflix's performance in the third quarter included a significant increase in subscribers, with 5.1 million net additions compared to the Video Advertising (VA) consensus prediction of 4.6 million. The company's positive momentum is further indicated by its fourth-quarter projections for operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS), which are all higher than analyst expectations. Furthermore, Netflix has provided a forecast for its 2025 revenue and operating income margin that aligns closely with current Street estimates. This outlook, combined with the company's recent financial achievements, suggests a potential uptick in Netflix's share value, particularly following some recent declines. In other recent news, Netflix exhibited a notable performance in the third quarter, with an addition of 5.1 million new subscribers, surpassing expectations. The streaming giant also projected a sequential rise in net subscriber additions for the fourth quarter, aiming for a total of 13 million by the end of 2023. Firms such as Morgan Stanley and Bernstein have responded positively to these developments, raising their price targets for Netflix to $830 and $780, respectively. On the other hand, Phillip Securities downgraded Netflix's stock from Buy to Neutral, despite raising the price target to $695. This comes in the wake of robust revenue and profit growth, but the firm adopted a neutral stance due to the recent strength in Netflix's share price. Canaccord Genuity also adjusted its price target for Netflix to $760 from $750, maintaining a Hold rating on the stock. Netflix's full-year revenue growth expectations have been revised upward to 15%, and the operating income margin is projected to reach 27% by 2024. Looking ahead to 2025, Netflix anticipates 11-13% revenue growth and a 28% margin. Netflix's recent financial performance aligns with several key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's strong subscriber growth and better-than-expected financial results are reflected in its impressive market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Netflix has seen a remarkable 98.63% price total return over the past year, significantly outperforming the broader market. The company's robust financial health is further evidenced by its revenue growth of 13.0% in the last twelve months, with quarterly revenue growth accelerating to 16.76% in Q2 2024. This growth trajectory supports Netflix's position as a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, as highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips. Another InvestingPro Tip notes that Netflix is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.59. This suggests that despite the recent stock price appreciation, there may still be value for investors, aligning with Citi's maintained price target. For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for Netflix, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market outlook.

Title: Nvidia facing a 'generational' opportunity, stock has nearly 40% upside left: BofA

Investing.com -- Bank of America analysts on Thursday reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock and lifted the price target from $165 to $190, implying nearly 40% upside from current levels. BofA also hiked its 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 13% and 20%, respectively. The bank believes that Nvidia, which holds an 80-85% market share, is facing "generational opportunity" in a total addressable market (TAM) exceeding $400 billion, a significant jump from the current year's projections. Analysts said their bullish stance on the stock has been bolstered by several recent industry developments – TSMC’s recent blowout report, AMD’s AI event, and strong Blackwell demand, among others – as well as the company's robust competitive positioning. Moreover, they highlight Nvidia's underestimated enterprise partnerships with major firms like Accenture (NYSE:ACN), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), as well as its software offerings. “NVDA’s engagements span multiple verticals, and offerings such as AI Foundry, AI Hubs, NIMs are key levers to its AI leadership, not only on the hardware side but also on systems/ecosystems side,” they noted. BofA projects that Nvidia’s free cash flow (FCF) at 45-50% margin remains underappreciated, as it is nearly double the average of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech giants. “In $ terms, NVDA could take in $200bn+ of FCF over the next two years, rivaling that of AAPL and providing growth optionality,” analysts said. In its bull case scenario, BofA suggests that Nvidia could outperform expectations if the networking segment mix reaches 17-18%, driven by the ramp-up of its Spectrum switch and potential market share gains in Ethernet. This could conceptually lead to sales exceeding $200 billion in the fiscal year 2026. Furthermore, there is potential for gross margins to improve toward the mid-70% range, factoring in system mix shifts and better yields from the Blackwell product line.

Title: Meta layoffs are the latest sign that constant job cuts are the new Big Tech normal

The hashtag affixed to Andy Welfle's LinkedIn photo says it all: #sickofthisshit. Welfle wrote earlier this month that he was laid off from Microsoft after only nine months. He'd previously spent nine months at Cruise before being laid off. His dual layoffs might have been worse than what many others experienced, but Welfle is hardly alone in getting hit by what appears to be some employers' penchant for regular layoffs, particularly in Silicon Valley. One of the latest examples is Meta, which said on Wednesday that it was rejiggering some of its biggest businesses, resulting in lost jobs at Instagram, Reality Labs, and WhatsApp. It wasn't clear how many roles were eliminated. A Meta spokesperson told Business Insider on Wednesday that the company was looking for other positions for affected workers. After shedding workers in sweeping layoffs in late 2022 and early 2023, many tech companies are taking a more methodical, department-by-department approach to making cuts. Major firms including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have announced sizable reductions followed by more modest trimming. Take Google. The tech giant's parent company, Alphabet, began 2023 by cutting some 12,000 jobs, or about 6% of its workforce. It followed that with smaller reductions this year. Art Zeile, the CEO of the tech-career marketplace Dice, told BI that some of the biggest companies in the industry had determined that certain departments were no longer sufficiently profitable and that they needed to redirect resources to growth areas like artificial intelligence. "It is a shifting of bets," he said, adding that this routine trimming of jobs here and there is the new normal — for now. Unsurprisingly, even with growth in some areas, the drip-drip of reductions in the past couple of years appears to be making some tech workers nervous. In a June survey from Indeed that involved more than 1,100 US tech workers, 40% of respondents said they expected to be affected if their company conducted layoffs. Seven in 10 said they'd start looking to other employers if their company laid off workers. Linsey Fagan, a senior talent strategy advisor at Indeed, told BI that most of the recurring layoffs were in tech. That's likely because many companies in the industry grew quickly during the pandemic and are still adjusting. But those recurring cuts don't come without costs, Fagan said. "It's definitely not a sustainable strategy," she added. Fagan said employee sentiment starts to drop before a layoff as workers suspect cuts are coming. After the layoffs, workers' feelings about the company — and a CEO's acumen — take "a long-term dive," she said. "When you look at a business trying to come back from that — if they're continuously laying off, it simply can't happen," Fagan said. Even smaller-scale layoffs can make workers jittery, she said. Fagan added that the rise of technologies like generative AI and the threat of layoffs were pushing many in tech to build their skills. Tech workers looking for jobs on Indeed, she said, are now more likely to apply to staffing firms, which might offer temporary gigs, or to roles in areas like healthcare than to tech firms. Fagan said that while some tech workers are drawn to the flexibility that contingent or part-time roles can offer, tech has historically been the No. 1 industry tech workers want to work in. "They're just not feeling that stability right now," Fagan said. Some companies' penchant for regular nips and tucks could be a result of Wall Street's celebration of that type of trimming. At Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was "beautifully rewarded" by the market for making cuts, Zeile said, noting a rise in the company's stock price. Beyond what investors might cheer, the tech giants are getting older and no longer in growth mode, when their aim was often to snap up workers. Hence, many companies made cuts following the rush of hiring during the pandemic. Since then, some bosses have been looking to trim the size of their organization and otherwise make improvements. Zuckerberg famously declared that 2023 would be the company's "year of efficiency." He also said the directive would become a feature, not a bug. Zeile predicted that investors would eventually look to tech companies to do more than boost profits by trimming costs and would want to see a return to growth. He said hiring would pick up broadly as companies find they have many areas in need of workers. A company like Meta might be cutting in some areas, but it's growing elsewhere, Zeile said. "Meta is actually on a tear right now," he said. "They're just no longer hiring VR engineers. They are hiring AI engineers, so they've actually boosted their hiring." Fagan said a sign that the tech industry might be closer to stabilizing was that, after declining for several years, job postings in areas like software development had remained flat in recent months, though they're still 30% below 2020 levels. Of course, that means there are fewer opportunities for laid-off workers. Still, she said, it's an indication that companies are being careful not to hire too many people. "It's not like they're going out and massively hiring and then doing layoffs," Fagan said. Welfle, who was laid off from Microsoft, wrote on LinkedIn that he was looking for a content-design role — maybe with a smaller company. He also said some of his feelings were similar to those he experienced after his layoff in December. "I'm having a hard time disentangling my sense of value and self-worth from my identity as a corporate worker," he said. "But I'll definitely be reflecting on that, and finding gentler, more sustainable ways to exist in a capitalist society."

Title: Learning to love nuclear power
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/learning-to-love-nuclear-power/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T09:42:39Z
Full Content:
Good morning. It’s been an encouraging week for fans of nuclear power. Amazon announced investments in three “innovative nuclear energy projects,” alongside Citadel’s Ken Griffin, that should deliver five gigawatts of zero-carbon energy over the next 15 years. Google announced a partnership with Kairos Power, which it described as “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors.” And that’s just this week. Microsoft last month announced a partnership with the energy firm Constellation to reopen a nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island—yes, that Three Mile Island—to come online in 2028. Why the sudden nuclear renaissance? The energy needed to power data centers for AI is one reason. The need to reduce carbon emissions amid climate change is another. Public support for nuclear energy has been growing in recent years. While nuclear power is clean, nuclear fission, the process to produce it, uses radioactive materials that can cause deadly levels of radiation if released into the environment in an accident. I recently spoke with Patti Poppe, the CEO of California’s Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) for the Leadership Next podcast that’s sponsored by Deloitte, which also supports this newsletter. Poppe has been focused on turning around the company’s operations, safety record, and culture, after PG&E’s culpability in the 2018 Camp wildfire put the utility into bankruptcy. Poppe believes the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant is “an important part of the mix.” “The conversation has changed globally and here in the United States,” says Poppe. ‘I think the nation has realized that we can operate nuclear units safely, that, yes, it was scary in the seventies, but that is a long time ago. And we have realized that there are ways, just like with wildfire prevention, where we have a risk mitigation system in place at our nuclear power plant where we can fail safely.” What’s different is the emergence of small modular reactors or SMRs. Although versions have been around for years, the U.S. government and private corporations began making serious investments in developing them over the past decade. With their smaller and more flexible size, they can be quickly scaled up and adapted to a range of needs. But none are yet online in the U.S. and will need to clear regulatory approval. Bob Nardelli, the former Chrysler and Home Depot CEO, understands the landscape from his days at GE Power. Through his private-equity investment firm, X-LR8, Nardelli is now invested in BWX Technologies (BWXT), which makes a range of nuclear components and services. “I think it’s the solution for the future,” says Nardelli. “You don’t get line sag (sudden voltage drops), distribution loss, fires due to lightning hitting electrical lines and the life cycle is extradordinary.” More news below.

Title: India's IPO record shattered with $5.5 billion launch
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/indias-ipo-record-shattered-with-55-billion-launch/a-70499104

India is the world's third-largest auto market, set for further huge growth before the end of the decade. South Korean carmaker Hyundai is banking on a Bombay listing to solidify its market position. The South Korean auto giant Hyundai launched its initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday, billed as India's biggest stock market debut, and was projected to be worth about $3.3 billion (€3.05 billion). The first carmaker to go public in the South Asian country since Maruti Suzuki in 2003, Hyundai offered 142 million shares for sale, representing about 17.5% of the total shares of its Indian arm. By the end of Thursday, the IPO was twice oversubscribed, drawing bids of $5.51 billion. Reuters news agency cited unnamed sources linked to the listing as saying that Hyundai would price its shares at 1,960 rupees ($23.31, €21.49t), giving it a market valuation of $19 billion. That would value the Indian unit at about 40% of its Korean parent. In a sign of the popularity of Hyundai's listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange, institutions, including foreign investors, bid nearly seven times the shares reserved for them. Nearly $1 billion in shares were snapped up by institutional investors on Monday alone, including the government of Singapore and BlackRock, the giant US investment firm, which picked up stakes worth a total of $77.3 million. Fidelity, meanwhile, bought shares worth $76.5 million and domestic mutual funds were allocated shares worth $340 million. Hyundai India shares are expected to start trading on Tuesday (October 22). Already India's second-largest carmaker by sales, Hyundai is keen to build on the advantage gained by its early entry into the national market in 1996. Last year, Hyundai sold over 605,000 vehicles in India, a 9% increase from the previous year. It hopes the additional funds will help close the market share gap with leader Maruti Suzuki. India already has the third-largest auto sector in the world — and it is growing fast. Last year, more than 4.1 million vehicles were sold. The auto sector is a major pillar of the economy and the country's large, growing consumer base and urbanization rate, along with relatively low production costs, make it an ideal location for Hyundai to manufacture and sell its vehicles. India's government is keen to boost domestic electric vehicle production, which aligns with the Korean carmaker's strategy. Hyundai also sees India as a critical alternative to China and Russia, where sales have dropped because of geopolitical issues. The South Asian country offers a more stable environment to its peers. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Globally, Hyundai's IPO beats July's US listing by Lineage Logistics, the world's largest cold-storage firm, which was worth $5.1 billion. Hyundai's listing will also eclipse the 2022 IPO of the state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India, in which the government sold a 3.5% stake and raised $2.7 billion. Other top domestic listings in recent years include fintech giant Paytm, whose IPO was worth $2.2 billion in November 2021, and Coal India, which went public in 2010 at $1.8 billion. India's stock market has been booming over the past four years, growing by 210% between April 2020 — during the first pandemic lockdown — and last month. On Tuesday, the SENSEX, the index of the Top 30 stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange, was trading at 81,820. India recently pipped Hong Kong to become the fourth-largest stock market in the world. India's auto market has rapidly become ultracompetitive, and smaller domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have eaten into Hyundai's market share. "India is one of the most exciting auto markets in the world," Unsoo Kim, managing director of Hyundai's Indian unit, told a news briefing in Mumbai last week. "[The] IPO will ensure that Hyundai Motor India is even more dedicated to succeed in India." Hyundai plans to use proceeds from the IPO to enhance its research efforts and develop new cars, seeking to transform the country into a production hub for other countries in the Global South. Hyundai already delivers its India-made vehicles to more than 90 countries. "We intend to become a global manufacturing hub for Hyundai for the emerging markets," Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai India, told the Reuters news agency. "In [the] next 3-4 years, [a] 30% increase in production will improve our domestic and export volumes." The Korean automaker has already invested $5 billion in the country and plans to pump in another $4 billion over the next decade to help make its Indian operations a key plank of its electric vehicle (EV) production, as well as building EV infrastructure such as charging stations and a battery assembly plant. Hyundai currently has one manufacturing plant in India for local sales and exports. Production at a second plant is expected to begin operations in 2025, which will help take the firm's total capacity in India to beyond 1 million units a year.

Rachel Reeves convened the inaugural meeting of the British Infrastructure Taskforce as part of a new approach that involves government working with business to design policy that will unlock private investment, including by building business confidence in UK infrastructure investments. The Taskforce will explore different options to support the Government’s infrastructure goals to drive growth for the whole of the nation, and some of the UK’s biggest financial companies including LLoyds, HSBC, and M&G will be in attendance. This Government has committed to turbocharge infrastructure investment across the width and breadth of the UK. Invitees have been selected to ensure a wide range of experience and expertise in UK infrastructure. This marks a significant shift in approach, with key businesses and stakeholders invited to work with the government to support the delivery of its infrastructure agenda. It follows the announcement to launch a newly formed National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (NISTA) which will bring oversight of strategy and delivery under one roof. The NISTA will support the development and implementation of the ten-year infrastructure strategy in conjunction with industry which was outlined for the first time last week by the Chief Secretary Darren Jones. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves MP said: Increasing investment in infrastructure is a vital part of delivering on our number one mission to grow the economy and create jobs. Just days after our International Investment Summit, we are delivering on our promise to work with business to drive growth across the country, and the expertise of this Taskforce will be invaluable in the weeks and months ahead. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones MP said: We are serious about ending the cycle of underinvestment that has plagued our infrastructure systems for over a decade. The best way to do that is to design the solution with business in the room. That’s what this taskforce is all about. The Taskforce will meet regularly, offering insights that deliver long-lasting solutions for job creation, growth, and environmental goals. This builds on the success of the International Investment Summit, which saw hundreds of top international investors attend the event, £63 billion of confirmed investment into Britain, along with the launch of the £27.8 billion turbocharged National Wealth Fund. Tracy Blackwell, CEO, PIC said: We have a huge amount to invest and we want to invest more in Britain. There is no shortage of capital that can support the British economy’s capacity to grow. The right combination of policies and ideas will unlock that capital and boost growth. From planning reform and better use of public sector pension funds to a streamlining of institutions and regulations, there is a lot that Government can do to crowd in more private investment and deliver social value. It’s great to be in an ongoing conversation with the Chancellor about taking that agenda forward. Andrea Rossi, CEO, M&G plc said: M&G has been an active investor in the UK for 175 years. Of the £100 billion M&G invests in the UK, infrastructure remains a core part of delivering sustainable returns for our savers, clients and shareholders. The UK’s clear focus on infrastructure presents a significant opportunity to deliver economic and social progress and we are delighted to contribute our expertise.” Deepa Bharadwaj, Head of Infrastructure Europe, IFM Investors said: IFM is a major global infrastructure investor, a major investor in the UK, and is owned by pension funds. We look forward to solutions-based discussions that can unlock new investment across UK infrastructure sectors and themes”. Stephen Cohen, Chief Product Officer, Blackrock said: There’s a rapidly growing pool of capital to invest in infrastructure, but deploying it requires pragmatism in policy. We’re pleased to be working with the government in identifying policies that will support private investment. Charlie Nunn, CEO, Lloyds Banking Group said: At Lloyds Banking Group, we are committed to helping the UK deliver the infrastructure the country needs, supporting jobs and growth. We welcome the British Infrastructure Taskforce’s focus on increasing investment in UK infrastructure and addressing some of the fundamental barriers that have existed to date. As the UK’s leading bank for project finance, we will work closely with the government in the development of this taskforce, ensuring the work supports communities, businesses, and industries across the regions and nations of the UK. Anne Richards, Vice Chair, Fidelity International said: We have a shared ambition to drive growth in the UK by unlocking investment in infrastructure for the benefit of savers. Our best opportunity to achieve that is through collaboration with government and the industry. Andy Briggs, CEO, Phoenix Group said: Over the last three decades there has been an underinvestment in the UK economy compared to other developed nations. I am delighted there is a growing consensus that in order to grow we need to work together to invest. The British Infrastructure Taskforce provides the opportunity for business and government to work on shared priorities, help finance the social and economic infrastructure the country needs for the future, and give potential for better returns for pension savers.

On Friday, Nomura/Instinet maintained a Buy rating on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (2330:TT) (NYSE: TSM) stock, while increasing the price target to NT$1,400.00 from NT$1,355.00. The revised target comes after TSMC's recent analyst meeting where the company discussed its financial performance and outlook, particularly emphasizing the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in driving demand. The semiconductor giant reported a robust gross margin (GM) for the third quarter of 2024, reaching 57.8%, and provided guidance for the fourth quarter GM to be between 57.0% and 59.0%. These figures exceeded market expectations and reinforced the belief that a GM above 55% could become the new standard for TSMC. This is attributed to favorable pricing dynamics and efficiency improvements from the capacity conversion of its advanced N5/3 technologies. TSMC's forecast for fourth-quarter 2024 revenue growth is set at 13% quarter-over-quarter, surpassing both the analyst's prior estimate of 10% and the buy-side consensus of 5-10%. In light of this, Nomura/Instinet has increased its earnings per share (EPS) forecast for TSMC for the years 2024 to 2026 by 2-3%. The price target adjustment is based on a 24x multiple of the forecasted 2025 EPS, which remains unchanged. The analyst underscored that TSMC's stock presents an attractive value at 18x/19x NMR/BBG 2025F EPS, noting it is trading at roughly a 20% discount compared to the SOX P/E ratio. The optimism is further bolstered by TSMC's guidance, which suggests that the impact of new overseas fabs on GM will be managed effectively, with only a 2-3 percentage point dilution expected in 2025. In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has been the subject of positive analyst attention following strong third-quarter results. Both BofA Securities and UBS have raised their price targets for TSMC, with BofA setting it at NT$1,400 and UBS at NT$1,300, while maintaining their respective buy ratings. The upward revisions come after TSMC reported a third-quarter earnings per share of NT$12.54, surpassing market expectations by 8%. TSMC's third-quarter gross margin also made headlines, reaching 57.8%, higher than the company's guided range of 53.5-55.5%. This increase was attributed to higher utilization rates and cost improvements, particularly due to advancements in the 5/3 nanometer technologies. Additionally, TSMC has projected a gross margin expansion to 57.0-59.0% in the fourth quarter of 2024, exceeding previous expectations. Both BofA Securities and UBS are optimistic about TSMC's future, citing the company's leadership in the semiconductor industry and potential for continued growth. UBS projects TSMC's gross margin to further increase to 58.5% in 2025, considering factors such as a price increase on N5/3 technologies, improved utilization, and a decrease in N3 dilution. Moreover, TSMC reported a 12.8% sequential revenue increase to NT$23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024, driven by strong demand for 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies in smartphones and AI applications. The company also anticipates Q4 2024 revenue to be between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion. These recent developments underline TSMC's robust financial performance and promising growth trajectory. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSM) continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, aligning with Nomura/Instinet's optimistic outlook. According to InvestingPro data, TSM's revenue growth remains robust, with a 22.65% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. This growth is even more pronounced on a quarterly basis, with Q3 2024 showing an impressive 38.95% revenue growth. The company's profitability metrics are equally compelling. TSM boasts a gross profit margin of 54.45% and an operating income margin of 42.04% for the last twelve months, reflecting its operational efficiency and pricing power in the semiconductor market. These figures support the analyst's view on TSMC's ability to maintain high gross margins. InvestingPro Tips highlight TSM's strong dividend performance, with a 42.34% dividend growth over the last twelve months. This, coupled with a current dividend yield of 0.95%, underscores the company's commitment to shareholder returns amid its growth trajectory. For investors seeking a deeper understanding of TSM's potential, InvestingPro offers 16 additional tips, providing a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: The one big bank that had a challenging week
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-one-big-bank-that-had-a-challenging-week-080029351.html
Time Published: 2024-10-18T08:00:29Z
Full Content:
Investors cheered earnings from many of the biggest banks this past week, with one notable exception: Citigroup. The stock of the nation’s third-largest lender fell 5% on the day of its third quarter earnings announcement despite beating expectations and showing revenue growth across all five of its divisions. Through Thursday’s close it was up just 0.8% for the week, while other big-bank rivals from Bank of America (BAC) to Morgan Stanley (MS) churned considerably higher on renewed optimism about the industry. A big reason for Citigroup’s challenging week was the confusion that took hold during an exchange CEO Jane Fraser had with analysts on Citigroup’s earnings call Tuesday. It happened when Fraser did not immediately refute a question from analyst Mike Mayo about whether regulators had placed a new asset-cap restraint on Citigroup. After the bank’s stock fell, she later returned to the subject and tried to end the speculation about any new regulatory handcuffs. "Let me be crystal clear: We do not have an asset cap, and there are no additional measures,” Fraser said. “And not expecting any,” she added. The exchange was a reminder of the pitfalls facing Citigroup as it tries to convince investors that it has its compliance problems under control and that regulatory scrutiny won’t interfere with a multiyear transformation of the company that began last year under Fraser. The questions from analysts about the possibility of new constraints were spurred in part by a letter that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) sent earlier this month to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The senator urged the bank regulator to impose new growth restrictions on Citigroup and consider forcing a breakup if it doesn't adequately reform its long-troubled risk management and internal controls systems. "It may be time to break up Citi," she said in the letter. The idea of growth restrictions is a reference to a so-called asset cap that sets a ceiling on how big a bank can get until it satisfies regulators that any outstanding concerns have been resolved. Such a growth restriction was imposed on the US retail operations of Canadian bank Toronto Dominion (TD) last week after it pleaded guilty to violating anti-money-laundering regulations. Wells Fargo (WFC) has also been operating under an asset cap since 2018. It was imposed after a federal investigation uncovered millions of bank and credit card accounts that were opened for customers without their knowledge to meet sales goals. Citigroup is certainly no stranger to challenges with regulators, even recently. In July, its overseers hit the bank with $136 million in fines for failing to make sufficient progress on consent orders imposed by the Federal Reserve and the OCC in 2020. Earlier in the summer, regulators also found weaknesses in Citigroup’s "living will." There have been signs of some progress on old problems too. Earlier this month, the Fed said it had ended a decade-old enforcement action it filed against Citigroup in 2013 relating to anti-money-laundering policies. What Mayo wanted to know on the Tuesday conference call with bank management was whether Citigroup can bring down its expenses while investing in regulatory, compliance, and data initiatives the bank needs to escape the 2020 consent orders — and whether it has or is facing the "asset cap." CFO Mark Mason tackled the questions first. He pointed out that the bank has said it plans to cut its expenses from $53.8 billion to a range of $51 to $53 billion in 2026. That cost reduction is predicated on Citigroup being able to unwind certain international business units in addition to reducing its headcount. "​​Will there be headwinds? Yes," said Mason, referencing the bank's multiyear transformation effort. "We're also investing in risk and controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations,” he added. Fraser discussed how Citigroup was "focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure, risk, and controls, and all of that reduces risk as we go" but didn't directly address the asset cap. Mayo followed up by asking if Citigroup's regulatory issues were a client or internal problem and asked more about a possible asset cap. "We are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback, as well as our own lessons learned if we fall behind in an element of the consent orders," said Fraser. "So I feel very comfortable." It wasn’t until Fraser was asked a third time about an asset cap 30 minutes after the initial question that she shut down the speculation. "There was a bit of a pause and then some apparent confusion among investors before management was able to clarify unequivocally that there is no asset cap and that there are no additional restrictions beyond what has already been disclosed," Piper Sandler analyst Scott Siefers said a note. Siefers didn’t change his $73 price target for Citigroup next year. Citigroup’s third quarter results did beat expectations and its Wall Street unit did well as dealmaking optimism surged. But the bank's profits and net interest income both fell from a year earlier. Some investors may still be worried about a critical measure of Citigroup’s transformation plan under Fraser: a profitability metric known as ROTCE (return on tangible common equity). For its third quarter Citigroup posted a 7% ROTCE, down from 7.2% last quarter and far from the 11% to 12% it has vowed to reach in 2026. "Slogging along at a ~7% ROTCE, there's no question that Citi is a laggard and thus a suitable punching bag for shorts,” said a note from Oppenheimer, which lowered its price target by $1 to $91. "That said, we think that Fraser and Mason have gotten expectations to where they can confidently beat them." Other analysts also offered some optimism. "Despite the increased regulatory overhang on the stock in recent months, we note the progress that management continues to make in order to boost franchise profitability," Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala said in a Wednesday research note, pointing to Citi's improving wealth unit. Even Mayo, who was the first to ask this week about an asset cap, had some nice things to say afterward. "Management's comments should put this issue to rest barring some unforeseen event," he said in a Tuesday research note following the call. Wells Fargo analysts currently expect Citigroup to achieve a 10% ROTCE target in 2026, and Mayo said he still thinks Citigroup can get there. "Buy! Especially If You Left Before the End of the 3Q24 Call!!" he wrote. David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.

Earnings season is barely a week old. While the headlines have centered on big banks, Wall Street trading and credit card spending, the deluge of quarterly reports has yet to be seen from the digital upstarts populating the FinTech IPO Index. We’ll get there for sure. But in the meantime, in the past week, the prime movers of the FinTech IPO Index’s 3.7% surge came through the platforms, where partnerships and new products represented a broadening of the features and services offered to individuals and to businesses. That’s not to say that all platforms rose in lockstep. Futu shares sank 16.3%. The company said this week that it had launched its ETF-based intelligent robo-advisory services, a new feature designed to deliver personalized investment solutions tailored to clients’ risk appetites and investment preferences. The company said it is working with BlackRock to offer Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios powered by BlackRock strategies and insights. Other platforms’ surges more than tipped the balance of the index’s momentum to the upside. As reported by PYMNTS, Paymentus — which saw its stock roar ahead by 24.3% — has introduced a tool to help insurers offer instant digital disbursements. The Paymentus Disbursements Accelerator added to the Guidewire ClaimCenter, and is designed to help insurers rapidly weave instant digital disbursement capabilities into their claims management processes. The accelerator, the release said, lets policyholders get payouts in the way they wish, including payments to digital wallets, credit or debit cards, ACH transfers or via check. Upstart’s stock gained 20.5%. In an annoucement late last week, the company detailed a programmatic purchase commitment from funds managed by Blue Owl Capital. Blue Owl’s Alternative Credit strategy will purchase up to $2 billion of consumer loans on the Upstart platform over 18 months. The transaction includes an initial acquisition of a $290 million personal loan portfolio, which closed in September. The transaction was structured and closed by Atalaya Capital Management, an alternative credit manager that focused primarily on asset-based credit investments across consumer and commercial finance, corporate and real estate assets. Alkami and Nutmeg State Financial Credit Union launched the latest version of its digital banking services with the Alkami Digital Banking Platform. The credit union’s members, per the announcement, have access to a wide range of online and mobile banking services, ranging from account aggregation, and financial wellness education and services. Alkami shares were up 5.7% SoFi is expanding its loan platform with a new $2 billion investment. The new “loan platform business agreement,” announced this week is based on funds that will be managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group. The agreement expands the capabilities of SoFi’s loan platform business, where the company refers prequalified borrowers to loan origination partners, while also originating loans on behalf of third parties. The announcement follows last week’s news that SoFi had added two new credit cards to its digital financial services offering: one for consumers who prioritize earning rewards on their daily spending, the other for those focused on building or improving their credit scores. SoFi shares added 14.4% through the past five sessions. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Byju’s was planning to go public in early 2022 with several investment bankers giving the firm valuation as high as $50 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier. He alleged that many of his more than 100 investors had urged him to pursue aggressive expansion into as many as 40 markets. But, he added, those very investors got cold feet when global markets tumbled following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sending the venture capital market into a downward spiral. Raveendran said many of his investors “ran away,” and the departure of three key backers — Prosus Ventures, Peak XV, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — from the company’s board last year made it impossible for the startup to raise additional funds. Representatives of the aforementioned three firms as well as auditor Deloitte left the startup’s board last year, citing governance issues. Byju’s has since entered insolvency proceedings, and Raveendran, who no longer controls the company, said: “It’s worth zero. What valuation are you talking about? It’s worth zero.” Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup, counts BlackRock, UBS, Lightspeed, QIA, Bond, Silver Lake, Sofina, Verlinvest, Tencent, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Owl Ventures, and World Bank’s IFC among its backers. It has raised more than $5 billion to date. Raveendran said he remains hopeful that his startup will make a comeback. “I have nothing to lose. I came from a small village. I invested everything I had into the startup.” Topics Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati is reportedly fundraising for a new AI startup DJI sues Department of Defense over listing as a Chinese military company What we know about the layoffs at Meta I just spent my first week ever with an EV, the Chevy Equinox — here’s what it was like 23andMe faces an uncertain future — so does your genetic data Claude: Everything you need to know about Anthropic’s AI Meta lays off employees across multiple teams Reporter, India © 2024 Yahoo.

Title: My Favorite Tools For Working From Home

Zody II by Haworth Most people under invest in their office chair while working from home. It’s likely the most important piece of furniture that will determine how you feel physically and if ergonomic — will help you avoid things like future back pain. The best piece of advice I received was to always try a chair in person to make sure it’s the right fit for you. What I love about the Zody II by Haworth is that it’s the perfect cross between form and function. Because of back pain, my chiropractor recommends that I stand every 30 minutes which means I have to lift my desk to use it as a standing desk. The Zody II has a perch function (dual posture configuration) where you can raise it high enough and you can use the forward tilt feature which allows your seat to slope forward so you can extend your legs. Haworth has coined it forward tilt adjustment, if you ensure your configuration includes it you wont’ regret it. Additional ergonomic features include being able to adjust your seat depth and lumbar support. I’ve found myself adjusting the arm height frequently depending on if I’m actively typing or just listening in a Zoom meeting to take relief off my shoulders. Depending on preference, you can move the arms inward or outward which I often find myself adjusting as well. The Zody II includes other features which you’d expect in premium chair like easily adjusting the tension and seat height. What’s also fun is that you can customize things like color and fabric to truly make it your own. While the Zody II carries a premium price tag (which can depend on configuration), Haworth recently introduced the Breck chair which nails all ergonomic requirements without breaking the bank. Sitting in Breck feels responsive and you can adjust height and seat depth easily. They’ve designed the lumbar support to be easily adjusted and overall it’s more comfortable than most office chairs I’ve sat in over the years. Breck Office Chair Many companies provide an office stipend and if you can get your work to cover this expense it’s a great value for chair with a 12-year warranty for around $500. Purchasing can be a personal decision, like buying a mattress. Sometimes you need to try it out for a while or even a couple of visits to feel comfortable in your decision. As was told to me, try the chairs in person if you can as Haworth as a dealer locater available on their website. One of the most versatile pieces of furniture I’ve used comes from a company called Joybird. Buying nice furniture online can feel like a gamble, thankfully they have showrooms in major cities across the country. While it can naturally be used as a bedroom dresser, I prefer to use it as office storage in my living room. Fenton Chest What surprised me most was the quality of the Fenton Chest which is made with solid Acacia and engineered wood with walnut veneers. It feels well crafted and is made to last. It also arrived put together which is a huge plus. It’s also a nice touch that the top drawer is lined with a felt base. I solicited Gifty Walker, Director of Merchandising at Joybird, about what pieces of furniture people should consider when building their home office from scratch. “Since I personally need my home office to double as a guest room, I would first build around a sleeper sofa. My top picks are our Briar or Miller Sleeper Sofa. From there, I’d go with our Carver Desk. It’s the perfect size and it has drawers to keep things organized and out of sight for when you have guests over. To complete the room, I’d select the Monroe Floor Lamp that gives just the right amount of lighting for ambiance and video calls, while the machine washable Radha Rug helps tie your space together. Plus, the rug is a breeze to clean.” Gifty mentioned that storage is often one of the aspects often overlooked. She suggests considering a desk with built-in storage or a secondary furniture piece like a console cabinet to maximize space. I have a standing desk that has a small drawer so I can appreciate more storage especially within arms reach. While Joybird is rooted in Mid-Century style and bold colors, they’ve adapted to color trends like whites and neutral palettes. Another strong differentiator is that Joybird actually manufactures all of their customizable upholstery pieces. You can see their unique design embedded into much of their furniture pieces as they cover everything from home office to dining room and even decor pieces. “Where does the inspiration come from?” I asked. “When it comes to interior design, inspiration can be found anywhere. We spend time at trade and design shows that give us glimpses into what’s coming. Since design is not solely about aesthetics, but it is also about function and utility, we may see something that could be amazing but not resonate with our customer so we’ll modify based on what customers have shown interest in through sales. Interior trends and colors specifically often follow the fashion industry so we will keep a pulse on that. Other great sources are architecture design and nature. Think about the doorway arches and now we’ve seen that become a trend when it comes to rounded edges over clean and sharp corners. Green is often a top design color because it provides the same calming effects of being in nature,” Gifty explained. Perhaps my biggest takeaway from Gifty is that we often have to think about multi-functional spaces instead of the traditional dedicated office with traditional furniture. She said this shows up as a guest room and office combination and we need the right pieces like a sleeper sofa to fit the room’s needs from day to night. It’s a great reminder to question furniture purchases with function in mind. One of the significant changes I’ve made is my wardrobe. I don’t want to wear jeans at home because they’re not exactly comfortable, but I also don’t feel the best version of myself when I’m wearing sweatpants while I’m working. Men's Everywhere Pant Cozy Earth is widely known for their super soft bedding and they’ve extended their line into clothing. The Men’s Everywhere Pant is just that — I can wear them all day at work and run out for errands while being comfortable and never feeling like I have to change. They pair nicely with their Everyday Polo and unlike every other polo I’ve owned they don’t shrink after washing them (ideally cold water and hang drying). Working from home has motivated me to cook more. I’ve picked up the hobby of batch juicing and even bake bread for the family. I’ve used Caraway pots and pans for a few years and naturally learning how to use stainless steel was my next step as it’s generally a safe option to avoid toxins in your food. However, there is a bit of a learning curve. Stainless Steel Cookware Set You can be captivated by the colors and appearance of the Caraway lineup and I’ve found their Stainless Steel Cookware Set to deliver on that same promise. Stainless steel is designed to have more heat retention than non-stick pans. When used properly, your food should not stick to the pan. One of my favorite Caraway pieces is their dutch oven. As you may know, not all dutch ovens are created equal because the way one cooks may be slightly different from another. I’ve made braised short ribs thanks to YouTube chef Alison Roman to perfection with their dutch oven. Their stainless steel set, however, comes generously with four pieces and a nicely sized 10.5’’ frying pan which I find myself using most often — especially to make a quick and healthy piece of salmon. The pan storage unit it comes with has been very helpful for organization and since they’re stacked horizontally it prevents them from scratching one another. While it’s an investment in the stainless steel set, it seems built to last like my previous Caraway set. Over the last few years I’ve continued to tweak and optimize my home office and desk setup. There are two lights I’ve come across that have been very unique and could be useful depending on your needs. As someone who has a standing desk and attempts to minimize clutter in my office space, I have numerous mounts from Elgato that have been invaluable. The mounts themselves have eliminated the need for two tripods around my desk. I also used to have a key light which was my main source of light on myself along with a massive light box hanging above my desk. It’s a big space commitment for this type of lighting and it doesn’t look conducive if you’re trying to use the space for other things. Elgato Key Light Air Elgato makes a number of light sources, but what I like about their Key Light Air is that it’s an edge-lit LED panel with a small footprint that packs a big punch in terms of lighting. They come with very solid stands, but once again I use their Master Mount L to clamp both lights at the edges of my desk. I was skeptical about how much light these would produce, given their name “Air” and comparing them to the other models with larger LED panels. However, I can tell you I often have them in the 5-10% range of brightness and it’s plenty lit. The one thing to note is that they are controlled through the Elgato app. That means after pairing the lights you have to use the app to turn them on or change the brightness and color temperature. I haven’t had any major issues and it seems to work well most of the time. Once in a blue moon it will take an app refresh for both lights to connect. They have an on and off switch behind the panel, but it would be a nice touch if you could modify the brightness with a physical button. Just something to consider if you feel like you prefer a physical switch on a light. Dyson’s floor lamp is called the Solarcycle Morph and it definitely looks like something out of this world. There are many things that are unique about it but one of the benefits I appreciate is that is serves a dual purpose. You can extend the light out to shine directly or you can magnetically snap the light back into the tall cylinder and it creates an ambient light. The ambient light is perfect for reading, relaxing, and it’s the perfect lighting for the background of a Zoom call. Dyson Solarcycle Morph The Solarcycle has physical buttons and you can control the same settings through the Dyson app. The light also has a USB-C charging port on bottom, a feature I have not used often but it’s a convenience for some. Dyson offers a desktop model but I prefer the floor lamp if you have the space for it. Dyson is widely known for their vacuums and other beautifully designed items like cooling fans. One thing that’s important to me is saving space. They have a product that acts as both a cooling system, heater, and an air purifier called the Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde purifying fan heater. It’s a mouthful but deservedly so because it has three functions in one so I don’t need a fan, space heater, and air purifier. While I have all of those products separately, I’ve been able to put them in storage for now. The same Dyson app will pair with both the light and the purifying fan heater which is convenient. I mentioned batch juicing. One of the staples in my kitchen over the last year has been the Nama J2 juicer. It’s newest addition, the J3, is equally impressive. J3 Cold Press Juicer Because of the chambers that slow juice, it saves time because you can cut fruits and vegetables as you go and then put them inside. If you have children who like to help, it makes juicing fun because they get to watch the fruits swirl around as they begin to go down the chamber. Cleaning up takes about five minutes as you should hand wash and dry when you can to avoid any stains on the juicer itself. While I’ve made many batches of juice with it’s predecessor, the J3 yields about 16 oz of juice which is half as much as the J2. It also has a smaller sized base which makes it a great option for apartment living or if you like to travel with your juicer. If you plan to drink your juice right away it might make sense to consider J3. Performance wise they have the same motor (50 rpm). One thing I’d recommend, whether you use a Nama juicer or an alternative — find at least one recipe book that will inspire you to try new recipes. I typically make two juices per week. One being the green juice staple, and the other will either will be a rotating recipe or something completely new depending on what’s in season. As you cook more in the kitchen you have a need for different types of knives. As an adult, the only real knife I purchased was a Togiharu from Blue Apron that I broke in half inside of a watermelon. It was probably my fault, however, there are two brothers — Jared and Jordan, who have reinvented this houseware category. So much so that I can’t take a trip Costco without noticing one of their beautiful sets of knives. Cutlery Knife Set Admittedly, I’ve also bought knives that come in a pack of three from Bed Bath & Beyond and they ended up in the garbage within a few months. These knives are built to last as they’re made with German stainless steel. I always hand wash them and try to dry them right away and the condition of them remains outstanding. You can invest $150 in a set of knives that will probably last you at least a decade or more. The sets typically come with a small manual that tells you exactly what each knife is for — and honestly I’ve misplaced mine. Nonetheless — the chef’s knife works flawlessly. The bread knife works as advertised, and whether you’re cutting through a watermelon or a steak you’ll feel like you’re using a thousand dollar knife. What’s nice about their knife blocks is that you can keep them up and away from the kids rather than having them easily accessible in a drawer. I highly recommend it if you have little ones roaming around the kitchen. Another office solution that I wish I discovered years ago is the combination of the monitor arm by Humanscale along with their M/Connect 3 and Pro Dock. It’s given my desk plenty more room because I can put away my clunky stand that came with my Lenovo monitor. The arm is one of the most ergonomic inventions on the market. I used to use one from Fully (now Herman Miller) — but the Humanscale design and functionality makes it the iPhone of monitor arms. It’s beautiful and minimalistic. I also use my monitor as a movie screen and I can easier bring it forward with no hassle. What’s even more interesting is the hub on bottom. One of the biggest issues with a monitor that is also designed as a docking station is that all of your wires and connections hang from the monitor. I have an 8-inch hub literally hanging off the side of my monitor which is an eye sore. M/Connect 3 with monitor arm Taking a look under the hood, there’s an actual dock that sits below your desk — out of sight. In other words, you get the benefits of the minimalistic space saving design with the additional USB and USB-C charging ports, as well as the entire hub clamped under your desk (see below). M/Connect 3 with Pro Dock Unless you need your monitor stand and have a docking solution you’re in love with, I can’t think of a cleaner and more efficient setup. I know many people like to have a dual monitor, so you can pick and choose which type of monitor arm makes the most sense for you. You can also decide on three colors in terms of the Pro Dock that suites your color scheme. My standing desk has white legs so I prefer the white dock. Set aside 30 minutes to setup your monitor arm and docking station and you should be in business. Humanscale’s Vice President of Product Management, Mark Consolla, shared how your home office setup can support your overall health and productivity. "An ergonomic home office setup is essential for maximizing both your health and productivity. With more people working remotely, it's critical that workstations at the home are designed to support comfort and well-being. Our M2.1 monitor arm, with its easy-to-assemble and dynamically configurable design, helps users achieve an optimal ergonomic position, reducing strain and promoting better posture throughout the day. By investing in tools like the M2.1, professionals can enhance both their efficiency and their long-term health wherever they work." One of the tech gadgets I’ve found myself using most over the last few months is a device from Courant called the MAG:2 Classics. Essentially, it magnetically connects to my iPhone and serves a dual purpose. It’s a charger and a phone stand in one — as well as having a place to charge your AirPods on the base as well. I’m a fan of the brown leather look while they also have a linen option. MAG:2 Classics I find myself carrying it around with me much of the day. It’ll be at my desk when I’m working. In the kitchen if I’m cooking or washing dishes so I can watch YouTube clips. I’ve also used it to play workout videos because it serves as the perfect stand. It has a non-slip construction so you can use it almost anywhere. MAG:3 Classics Courant also makes a charging catch trays, one which they’ve coined the MAG:3 Classics. It has the MagSafe capability so your iPhone and AirPods will connect and charge very easily. I have it by my bedside and use it daily. I also don’t want to scratch the wood on my nightstand which is another reason why I keep it there for protection. One of the staples for any office space is an area rug, unless you’re in a carpeted room of course. Ensuring that you have a run on hardwood floors will also help with your sound quality as you want furniture and things to fill the room to avoid an echo. I searched high and low for a contemporary rug that’s easy to clean and I kept coming across a company called Revival. Their Shell rug was exactly what I was looking for. It’s very soft on your feet and easy to vacuum. Some rugs are insanely heavy. This was folded and packaged nicely, and it was light enough for me to carry around by myself. This specific rug comes in 4 color and 11 different sizing options. Always be sure to have a rug pad underneath because it will feel nicer and provide your rug with longevity. Shell washable rug I solicited Ben Hyman, co-founder and CEO of Revival about the inspiration behind the Shell rug. “We wanted to make a machine-washable rug that didn’t read as washable, but instead looked and felt as thick and soft as a standard hand-knotted rug. It was important to us to use recycled materials. The look of the collection was inspired by the accidental designs you find on the beach, made by waves on sand.” Revival is most known at the intersection between quality, design, variety, and affordability. However, buying a rug online is difficult. While it’s not exactly like buying a mattress — people often want to see and experience the rug in person before making the commitment. I asked Hyman how they’ve tried to make that experience more seamless for the customer. “Since the beginning we’ve invested heavily in our photography and descriptions to make sure we’re conveying all the important details about each rug. We have impeccable customer service, well-designed boxes, free shipping, complimentary interior design consultations, an augmented reality tool that lets you view your rug in your room, and a swatch program, so you can order samples of our bestselling rugs before you buy. We’re also constantly investing in the digital user experience on our website so that the experience feels intuitive and snappy. Collectively, these features make Revival a special place to shop.” Some people prefer a wool rug but they’re often very expensive. Typically, you have to take them to a rug cleaner which you have to take into consideration when it comes to the lifetime cost of the rug. Hyman and his global team have leveraged having a presence in places like Casablanca and Istanbul because it gives them access to local artisans. They’ve also somehow made wool rugs that are washable. “We’re proud of the R&D we’ve done around rug utility and sustainability, without compromising design. This focus on construction and materiality has resulted in products like our washable wool Lino and Helen rugs.” The team at Revival has kept their pulse on the market over the last few years, adapting to the needs of customers. “We started off as a purveyor of vintage rugs, a small niche within the much broader rug category. Early on we realized we needed to find a way to offer customers more than vintage; that it was important they have access to a wider range of time periods, including contemporary. Within a few years of producing new rugs it became clear customers were looking for washables, which has become a huge part of our business. it’s been a gradual evolution,” Hyman explained. While the pandemic wasn’t exactly an accelerator like it was for many e-commerce companies — there was a silver living for the team at Revival. “In 2020 we launched items like other textiles and furniture on the site. Yet we struggled to find our footing from both an operational and marketing perspective in these other categories, as we spread our small team too thin. In 2022 we came full circle, pivoting back to a more exclusive focus on rugs, and expanding our offering further in that category. This additional focus on high-quality, affordable rugs sets us apart; it took a while – and some missteps – to get there.” This led to them eventually establishing a significant inventory in the US so that stock issues wouldn’t hold them back, and rugs could ship out to their customers in 2-3 days. As we concluded our interview, I solicited Hyman for the best piece of advice he’d give someone shopping for a rug. “First — measure your room. Second — buy a rug pad. These two surprisingly simple things will make a huge difference in how good your rug looks.” One of the habits I’ve broken (in a good way) is buying coffee out and it’s saved a lot of money. I typically make tea at home but one thing that becomes frustrating is that my tea is either too hot or too cold. Enter the Ember Mug 2. Ember Mug 2 To admit, I was skeptical at first. However, when I keep the tea temperature at 145 degrees it’s just right — and the Mug 2 can keep that temperature for 80 minutes off the charger. The temperature can be controlled through their app and the design and color options are sleek. I do wish, however, they made an even larger option than 14 oz. It’s definitely big enough to function well but I am a fan of large mugs. I’ve also found and tested a $13 mug warmer from a local grocery store and it did the job, but you have to keep it on your desk or within reach. That’s a nice touch with the Mug 2 is that you can keep the charger in the kitchen and not have to worry about more clutter on your desk. I’m often looking for ways to save time and one tool that’s been helpful is the robotic pool cleaner by Polaris, specifically the FREEDOM Plus model. FREEDOM Plus Overall, using a robotic cleaner has saved me nearly 8 hours per month of manually scrubbing the pool and I don’t get the lactic acid and soreness built up in my shoulders and arms. Also, robotic cleaners use less energy because you don’t have to rely on the pool’s filtration system as often. I appreciated how lightweight thee FREEDOM Plus is because it makes it very portable. The inclusion of a charger stand with wheels makes it even more portable and convenient. The cordless feature is a notable advantage, as it eliminates the risk of entanglement and allows for uninterrupted use of the pool while the device is operational. This is a substantial improvement over traditional corded pool cleaners, which can be cumbersome and restrictive. While most robotic cleaners come with a hefty price tag it’s definitely worth exploring so you can save more time and invest that elsewhere. An important tip I learned from a course I took on setting up a home studio is the importance of plants in your Zoom background. It plays a significant role in how people perceive your office. One of the keys is to use artificial plants because you will always have a consistent look compared to a real plant that changes shape every so often. One of the biggest drawbacks to real plants is that there is often more work involved than meets the eye. You can’t just “set it and forget it.” Most plants need to be in sunlight and if they have issues you have to troubleshoot the humidity in your office and a plethora of other things that become more work. If you are a plant enthusiast that is another story. Artificial Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree with Artisan Planter CG Hunter is a company who makes artificial plants and trees. I’ve traversed every craft store that carries artificial plants and CG Hunter’s quality is in another stratosphere. I initially came across some of their trees at Costco was floored because I thought they were real. What are the benefits of an artificial tree versus a real one? I asked an executive at CG Hunter. “Faux plants and trees bring the beauty of nature into the home or office without the maintenance. They provide the lush vibrancy of real plants without the need for watering or sunlight, making them perfect for spaces with low light. With their low maintenance and long-lasting durability, they offer a cost-effective way to enhance any space without the need for ongoing care. Artificial plants are also pet friendly.” I solicited them for any additional considerations. “It is important to consider scale when buying faux trees as you want to use them to deliver height or fullness and dimension as well as texture, color, and pattern. Carefully selected faux trees and plants can be used to hide unsightly plugs or cords other blemishes in a room.” It’s so true. If you use a standing desk, you want to be mindful about how your plants and trees are visible in the background depending on whether you sit or stand. My chiropractor recommended I stand every 30 minutes — so I’m always keeping that in mind. For example, if my plant is too short and I lift my desk then it may be out of sight. I’ve found it helpful to turn on a Zoom meeting, setup your background, and look at your monitor to see what the other people would see. One other pro tip is to have the plan partially in your shot because it makes the length and size of the room feel larger than it may be in real life. close up of Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree One thing I like about the Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree (pictured above) is the thickness of the leaves. If you are using a high quality web cam or a mirrorless camera for Zoom, you want to have a slight blur in the background. Not the kind of blur Zoom offers because your room is messy — I mean the slight blur that you see on a quality video podcast. Thicker greenery will often pop in your picture. As you can see the texture of the trees from CG Hunter truly come alive. Most importantly you have to test things out in your environment and see what works for you based on what look you are trying to achieve. Lastly, one of my favorite items that I’ve used to and from the office and coffee shops is my Briggs & Riley backpack. What I love most about it is that it doesn’t slouch over like most brands. You can sit it on the floor or next to your desk and it keeps shape. The design is thoughtful and intentional, and it has every compartment you would need — even for a quick flight. It always serves as my carry-on when I travel. Medium Cargo Backpack Like their timeless luggage, the backpack just works and it matches just about any wardrobe. What also makes Briggs & Riley stand out is their customer service. I’ve had luggage have issues in the past because the airline slammed them during transport and Briggs & Riley has fixed them with their lifetime warranty. They’ve also nailed the intersection of quality and price with unique products that last a liftetime. My previous favorite shoe that was easy to put on and incredibly comfortable was the Hupana Flow by HOKA. While they have discontinued the model, what I like about the Transport shoe is that have the quick-toggle laces where you don’t have to tie your shoes. You can just pull up the tongue and slip your feet in and go. HOKA is widely known for making the most comfortable shoes and this model delivers on that promise. Men's Transport shoe in Alabaster / Varsity Navy They’re also treated with a topical water repellent agent that make them a go-to for light drizzle. What I’ve found is that the further you go towards a rainboot, the less comfortable shoes can be. The Vibram outsole, which can be found on other models, makes it especially nice for the elements. So far these have been very comfortable and I’m glad they come in a wide option. Personally, I like to limit clutter around the front door so there are usually two pairs of shoes there. One for working out and another for running errands. I probably won’t throw away my Hupanas until there are more holes in them, but I’m optimistic the Transports will replace them in the near future.

Title: Ambitious James Culhane keen to push on after two seasons of stop-start
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/18/ambitious-james-culhane-keen-to-push-on-after-two-seasons-of-stop-start/

Full Content:
It tells us much about James Culhane’s potential that despite being sidelined by various ailments and injuries, restricting him to just eight Leinster appearances during two seasons in their academy, he was upgraded to a senior contract in advance of this season. Now, after his second Emerging Ireland tour finished with him captaining the side to their concluding 33-24 win over the Cheetahs, Culhane could make his first start of the season against Connacht at the Dexcom Stadium on Saturday (kick-off 7.35pm). If so, it will be his first start for Leinster since the corresponding game in Galway which cruelly ended his season last December. “I tore my hammy and fractured my shoulder in the same game. So, there is a bit of trauma there. I think my hamstring is still somewhere around the 22-metre line of that pitch,” he says, showing a nice line in gallows humour. The injuries happened within two minutes of each other. “I did my shoulder first and was supposed to come off but I think Max Deegan had gone off for a ‘bloods’ so they were like ‘two minutes and then you can come off’. “Then we scored a try and I caught the kick-off. Right before I was to come off two lads jumped on my shoulder and I just went to step off my left leg and I felt it pop. I’ve never had an injury like that before, so I knew there was something seriously wrong. Then the scan said it all.” Having never suffered a hamstring injury before, he’d tore one off the bone. Now completing his degree in electrical engineering at UCD, his life is largely about time management, although his studies were a blessing during rehab. “I split my course up a little bit, but on average it is a 40-hour studying week, so it is tough to fit that in with training every week. But when I got injured, I had something to focus on and that was a big benefit. “I wasn’t just feeling sorry for myself the whole time. I’ve done well so far and I don’t think my parents [Paul and Margaret] would ever let me quit the college side of things, so I am forced to do it,” he says, smiling. Reared in Enniskerry, education has always been a priority for Culhane and his sisters Rosie and Lily, even though his dad was also a number eight who captained St Munchin’s, the Ireland Under-21s and Irish Universities (against a New Zealand team featuring Seán Fitzpatrick) before injury cut short his career. Like father, like son, they are both Arsenal fans, and Culhane was also a handy footballer with Wayside Celtic and Gaelic footballer with Kilmacud Crokes. He captained Blackrock College to the Leinster Schools Junior Cup in 2018 and would have captained the senior team in 2020-21 but for Covid. In Ireland’s Under-20 Grand Slam-winning side of 2022 his record carrying metres (349 from 66 carries) saw him named player of the championship, but he was soon hospitalised for a month with a kidney infection, probably the consequence of overtraining and dehydration. While that was excessive, it shows how driven Culhane is. Bright and humble, but ambitious too, he describes the Emerging Ireland tour as “another stepping stone” and an opportunity to work with Paul O’Connell. “He kind of knows everything, to be honest.” Culhane also gives an interesting take on the “freshness” of Jacques Nienaber and Tyler Bleyendaal. “When Stu [Lancaster] was in he controlled both attack and defence. He kind of did it all himself, so it’s good to get different eyes on things. Jacques has the new defensive set-up that we’ve never really experienced in Irish rugby before. That’s still something we’re learning, but we’ve made good ground on that. “Attack-wise, it’s not too dissimilar, Tyler really enjoys just ‘play what’s in front of us’ sort of thing so it’s not always too systematic, especially on transition, whereas in the past we would have just focused on playing our own system, not seeing outside of it. But Tyler really encourages players to take space if they see it.” Mature beyond his years, Culhane captained Leinster in preseason friendlies this year and last, further demonstrating they know they have a good one here. This is also a big season for him. Not in an arrogant way, but more stating the obvious, Culhane says: “I think it’s time now to push into this Leinster team and it’s pretty obvious once you’re in a Leinster team that you’ll find yourself in an Irish squad. So, that’s the goal. Especially in my first year of senior, I’m trying to make some moves.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin ‘To the moon!’ What’s behind Michael Saylor’s prediction?

BTC’s price rally fuels bullish sentiment, with supply shortage signalling more gains. Bitcoin [BTC] bulls are having a field day as their Uptober dreams appear to be turning into reality. This week, the king coin made a remarkable comeback, breaching critical resistance levels. On the 16th of October, the king coin climbed to $68,424, marking its highest price in nearly three months. MicroStrategy Co-Founder and Chairman Michael Saylor chimed in on the excitement, declaring, “To the moon.” His words captured the optimism among crypto enthusiasts, as Bitcoin’s surge fueled renewed confidence and excitement. At the time of writing, the coin had slightly pulled back to $67,458 but remained up by 0.97% over the past day and 10% over the past week. Aside from the positive price movement, developments on the supply side have fueled traders’ expectations for further gains. Firstly, Bitcoin miners produce only 450 BTC daily, which falls short of meeting the rising demand driven by ongoing accumulation from institutional investors. For instance, BlackRock recently added $391.8 million worth of Bitcoin to its holdings. Worth noting that spot Bitcoin ETFs hold total net assets of $64.46 billion, representing 4.82% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization, according to data from SoSo Value. Additionally, the circulating supply of Bitcoin has reached 19.77 million, accounting for 94.14% of the total supply. Lastly, as per CryptoQuant, the Exchange Reserve has fallen to a five-year low of just 2.6 million BTC. As a result of these factors, the likelihood of a supply shock appears increasingly imminent. Source: CryptoQuant To gain deeper insights into market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, AMBCrypto analyzed the derivative’s data. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) recently reached an all-time high of $20 billion, signaling increased participation and interest. Source: CryptoQuant CME Bitcoin Futures OI also hit a record high, reflecting growing institutional involvement. Moreover, the funding rate was positive at press time. Data from Coinglass showed a Long/Short Ratio of 1.02, indicating a slight preference for long positions. These metrics suggested overall optimism in the market. Amid the favorable market environment, with Saylor eyeing the moon, it seems that the moon might be around $70,000. The 6-month liquidation heatmap from Coinglass revealed a substantial liquidity cluster at this level, with $72,300 and $72,600 emerging as the next magnetic zones likely to attract the price. On the downside, significant liquidity was concentrated around $67,000 and $65,000. If BTC drops to sweep these levels, a rebound could follow. Source: Coinglass Thus, given Bitcoin’s trajectory, bulls remain hopeful of reclaiming the record highs set in March.

Title: Watch These Netflix Price Levels After Q3 Earnings Drive Stock Higher

Netflix (NFLX) shares jumped 5% in extended trading on Thursday after the streaming giant topped Wall Street’s third-quarter estimates and issued a strong revenue outlook. During the quarter, Netflix added 5.1 million subscribers, surpassing expectations of 5 million, though the company has shifted its focus to revenue and profit margins as its business model matures. The company said it’s targeting an operating profit margin of 28% next year compared to its 27% goal this year, adding that its sees ample room to increase its margins over the long term. Netflix shares have gained more than 41% this year prior to Thursday’s after-hours pop as investors cheer the company’s ongoing efforts to expand its advertising business and offer more live streaming events. Below, we’ll break down the technicals on the Netflix chart and identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching out for. Netflix shares have traded within a rising wedge since late June, with the price recently retracing to the pattern’s lower trendline and 50-day moving average (MA). Importantly, the stock on Thursday also registered its largest day of volume since mid-July, indicating portfolio repositioning ahead of the streaming giant’s quarterly results. Given the stock’s expected earnings-driven jump, let’s look at several key overhead price levels that may come into focus and also point out two key support areas where the shares may attract buying interest during pullbacks. Firstly, investors should eye the $735 level, an area on the chart where the shares could run into selling pressure near the rising wedge pattern’s upper trendline. This trendline has provided resistance on two separate occasions since late September. To project a price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), we can use the measuring principle. This chart technique works by calculating the distance of the rising wedge near its widest point and adding that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $125 to $735, which projects an upside target of $860. If a post-earnings rally fades, investors should initially monitor the $688 level. The stock could attract support in this area near the symmetrical triangle’s lower trendline, which also corresponds with a range of similar trading levels within the pattern. A decisive breakdown below the wedge’s lower trendline opens the door for a decline to around $635, a level on the chart where investors may seek entry points near consolidation periods on the chart in April, May, and June, with the closely watched 200-day MA also positioned nearby.

Title: TSMC Says It Will Take “Prompt Action” If Found In Violation of Huawei Sanctions

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has assured that it is committed to complying with all regulations that prohibit it from selling chips to and having business dealings with Chinese technology giant Huawei. Huawei is forbidden by US law to acquire high end chips that are manufactured using US origin technologies, and TSMC's comments came in response to a report that claimed that the firm was being investigated by the US for having ties to Huawei. The purported investigation is being headed by the Commerce Department, and it covers TSMC's artificial intelligence and smartphone chips. TSMC's statement comes after a paywalled report in The Information which had claimed that the Commerce Department was investigating TSMC for having supplied Huawei with chips used in either smartphones or artificial intelligence systems. Huawei's smartphone chips have been heavily scrutinized since US sanctions in 2020 stopped TSMC from selling the most advanced products to the company. For instance, TSMC cannot sell chips made through 7 nanometer or lower process technology nodes to Huawei, and with Huawei's competitors such as Apple now using 3 nanometer chips in their smartphones, the restrictions have dealt a sizable competitive blow to the firm due to its work with the Chinese government. The rise of AI has further increased the scrutiny of advanced processor shipments worldwide. These have led to NVIDIA facing US restrictions for selling some products to Huawei, and they have also increased China's efforts to develop its local AI ecosystem to reduce reliance on Western technology. In response, TSMC has stressed that it "is a law abiding company," adding that "we are committed to complying with all applicable regulations." TSMC states that if is has "any reason to believe there are issues, we will take prompt action to ensure compliance." With the surging demand for AI processors helping TSMC to recover from a slump in the consumer electronics industry, any violations of US law could create complications for the global semiconductor industry. Since TSMC supplies most of the chips made on order worldwide, legal and regulatory complications might restrict its access to advanced chip manufacturing equipment. This in turn could force firms to diversify their chip manufacturing supply chains. TSMC's sizable presence in Taiwan and the region's geopolitical tussles with China have also created unease in chip companies about the threat of supply chain disruption in case of conflict in the South China Sea. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang remarked last month that his firm's chip design capabilities allow it to shift away from TSMC in the worst case scenario since NVIDIA designs "diversity and redundancy into every aspect wherever we can. And then the last part of it, is, to have enough intellectual property in our company in the event that we have to shift from one fab to another, we have the ability to do it." TAIWAN SEMI $TSM RESPONSE: “TSMC IS A LAW-ABIDING COMPANY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. IF WE HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THERE ARE ISSUES, WE WILL TAKE PROMPT ACTION TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.” https://t.co/H3oGDj0D6w — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 18, 2024 Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inbox Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Letters: We must reject far-right demagogues threatening democracies worldwide

Elon Musk endorses Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Photo: Getty As the US prepares to vote for a new president, the campaign here, and the candidates’ behaviour, should act as a warning to voters in Ireland and other democracies around the world. For more than a decade we have been plagued by far-right rhetoric and disinformation designed to activ­ate the worst instincts of people. Donald Trump’s cult-like following has debased our politics and our civic society, making us weaker, darker, more resentful, angrier and more polarised. It has enabled racist, ignor­ant, misogynistic, nativist groups to emerge and foment divisions that harm the nation and our social fabric. The appeal, however limited, of Independent Ireland and the move in Ireland to create a National Alliance of far-right groups is cause for alarm. Ignorance and disinformation are key to the growth of these movements. Democracies need to strengthen civic institutions, elevate civil discourse and educate young people to understand why it’s important to participate in their communities. Demagogues like Trump, Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson feed on the worst impulses of people, and they offer no constructive solutions. At the same time, mainstream political parties need to devise and seriously embrace policies that address problems including housing, healthcare, immigration, environmental devastation and economic opportunity. These are problems to be solved by serious, thoughtful political parties and policy-makers, informed by data and open to rational debate. Far-right demagogues who threaten democracies do long-term harm and need to be rejected by voters. Jim McManus, Massachusetts, US The slanted reporting of most journalists on the US presidential election is blatant. Their failure to report the truth is disappointing and harmful. Fair and balanced reporting is ess­ential to guarantee the authenticity of the democratic process. J Anthony Gaughan, Blackrock, Co Dublin The electoral college, another 18th-century remnant, will deliver the presidency to Donald Trump or Kam­ala Harris next month, contradicting the popular vote and, for many, rendering the election meaningless. Until this outdated remnant is disbanded, US democracy will continue to discredit itself. It’s my contention that the vote of every US citizen should count – not just those of partisan electoral college insiders. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary When Sinn Féin forgot, or neglected, the historical reason for the depart­ure of Éamon de Valera and his followers to form Fianna Fáil (“a slightly constitutional party”), it was bound to run into its current difficulties. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said recently that Leo Varadkar “has found his inner Shinner”. I would say the Shinners have “found parliamentary democracy” a threat to their totalitarianism. Declan Foley, Melbourne, Australia Have some members of Dáil Eireann taken a pay cut? Convalescing following an illness, I watched proceedings in Leinster House at government “question time” and was less than impressed by the sartorial inelegance of some of our elected representatives. It looked like dress-down Friday, but it was only Tuesday. I also noted an urban/rural divide, with those deputies from beyond the Pale showing respect for their office, their constituents and themselves, in turning out dressed appropriately for the privileged positions they hold. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan Further to Tom Grufferty’s letter on kindness being “only in Ireland”, (Letters, October 17), I was reminded of a school trip some years ago when we visited several eastern Europe countries where the Irish students were intimidated by the stern attit­udes of border officials. It was only on their return to Dublin, greeted by border management personnel with jokes, smiles and being addressed by their first names, that they finally relaxed. Ireland of the hundred thousand welcomes indeed. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Rian Noctor reminds us of one of the greats of Irish rugby, Anthony ‘Axel’ Foley, whose death eight years ago at the age of 42 shocked the sporting world (‘“He’s always spoken about” – Munster aim for Stormers win as tribute to Anthony Foley’, Irish Independent, October 17). There’s a beautiful and striking riverside memorial stone to the rugby legend in his native Limerick at a place called Clancy’s Strand on The Three Bridges River Walk. Whenever I pass this stunning statue erected in his honour in this rugby-mad city, I’m reminded of how fleeting life is, but also how sport can be a force for good when played with the passion and excitement with which the former No 8 thrilled his fans. Munster will be hoping that the legend of Axel Foley will propel them to victory away to the Stormers in Cape Town this weekend. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry The Los Angeles Archdiocese has agreed to pay $880m (€813m) in response to sexual abuse claims. It appears many of these clerics didn’t read their Bibles. Matthew 18:2-6 states: “If anyone causes one of these little ones – those who believe in me – to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.” How can people supposedly devoted to doing right do what they did? There are so many clergy who do so much good, but there are a few that let the team down.

Here is a quote: “The Biden-Harris administration’s ban on new permits for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports threatens nearly one million jobs over the next two decades if the restriction remains in place, a new study finds. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) conducted a study in partnership with PwC that was shared exclusively with FOX Business and found that between 515,960 and 901,250 jobs – as well as about $103.9 billion in labor income – would be threatened if the ban remains in place through 2044. The analysis used the Department of Energy’s outlook prior to the ban announcement to calculate its potential long-term impact.

Jennifer Newstead, Chief Legal Officer of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), recently sold 905 shares of the company's Class A Common Stock, amounting to a total transaction value of $533,922. The shares were sold at a price of $589.97 each. Following this transaction, Newstead holds 33,292 shares directly. The sale was conducted under a pre-arranged trading plan established on November 30, 2023. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has seen several financial firms, including TD Cowen and Mizuho Securities, raise their price targets on the company's shares, underlining an optimistic outlook for the firm's revenue growth. TD Cowen, in particular, expects Meta's revenue to grow by 19% year-over-year in the third quarter, attributing this anticipated rise to enhanced user engagement and better monetization of video content. The company has also been making strategic adjustments affecting Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs teams, with some employees being relocated and others reassigned. In addition, Mizuho Securities has highlighted the additional revenue potential stemming from political advertising and the significant potential in Meta's messaging services and generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) for creative purposes. Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Meta, suggesting continued aggressive investment in infrastructure due to the AI arms race. However, Meta has also been ordered to face lawsuits alleging that its social media platforms contribute to addiction among teenagers. These recent developments underscore the dynamic and evolving landscape in which Meta is operating. While Jennifer Newstead's recent stock sale might raise eyebrows, it's crucial to view this transaction within the broader context of Meta Platforms' financial performance and market position. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a substantial market capitalization of $1.46 trillion, underscoring its status as a tech giant. The company's revenue growth remains robust, with a 24.28% increase over the last twelve months, reaching $149.78 billion. Meta's financial health appears strong, as evidenced by two key InvestingPro Tips. First, the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet," indicating a solid financial foundation. Second, Meta demonstrates "impressive gross profit margins," which stood at 81.49% for the last twelve months. These factors suggest that despite executive stock sales, the company's underlying business fundamentals remain sound. It's worth noting that Meta's stock has shown remarkable performance, with a one-year price total return of 78.6%. This aligns with another InvestingPro Tip highlighting Meta's "high return over the last year." For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into Meta's financial outlook and market position.

Prime Election Day: Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service has officially thrown its hat into news coverage. As Puck’s Dylan Byers reported weeks ago, Prime Video has struck a deal with former NBC News anchor Brian Williams to helm special election night coverage that will be free to watch globally for viewers both with or without a Prime subscription.. Election Night with Brian Williams will stream on Prime Video beginning at 5 p.m. ET on Nov. 5. Williams, who last helmed The 11th Hour on MSNBC before stepping down in 2021, will be joined by prominent guest contributors who will share real-time poll results and commentary while referencing third-party news sources across all political affiliations. The special will be produced by Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner, with Jonathan Wald as executive producer and showrunner and Weiss also serving as director. Introducing Election Night Live With Brian Williams, a one-night special delivering election results and analysis. Streaming in most countries on November 5 beginning at 5 pm ET / 2 pm PT, no Prime membership required. pic.twitter.com/Do1TM6Mask — Prime Video (@PrimeVideo) October 17, 2024 Signing Off: CBS News 24/7 anchor John Dickerson signed off from his streaming news show The Daily Report with John Dickerson on Tuesday night. He’s not moving far away, though. Following the presidential election, he’ll be one of the soon-to-be-revamped CBS Evening News co-anchors. At the end of his final streaming broadcast, Dickerson paid tribute to his behind-the-scenes colleagues, saying: “Thank you for working so hard to get it right. Thank you for the honor of allowing me to associate my name with your work.” In the interim, CBS News’ Lindsey Reiser will take over Dickerson’s duties on The Daily Report. Watch Dickerson’s sign-off below: Job Cuts: The contraction within the news media industry continues as both the BBC and NBCUniversal News Group announced layoffs within their respective news divisions this week. A total of 130 positions from BBC’s news and current affairs departments will be eliminated, according to the PressGazette. Impacted programs include the long-running BBC News Channel interview program Hardtalk, which has been cancelled; BBC Click, which shifts from a TV format to a digital one; and the Asian Network’s news service, which loses its signature news programs. Over at NBCU, Semafor’s Maxwell Tani reports that the news division and CNBC saw layoffs this week. A CNBC representative tells TVNewser that the number of layoffs was constricted to “single digits” and were part of a natural realignment aimed at focusing on business priorities while investing and hiring in areas that offered continued growth. A few people tell me the NBCU cuts are a bit more pronounced than what I described yesterday. At CNBC, the layoffs include producers, video and graphics staff, as well as employees on market research and marketing. — Max Tani (@maxwelltani) October 16, 2024 Growth Opportunities: Sticking with CNBC, the network announced the new weekend show Millennial Money, which sprouted from its personal finance digital platform, Make It. The digital video series graduates to CNBC’s weekend lineup on Sundays at 5 p.m. ET and will be hosted by Ashton Jackson. “Chances are, you’re probably curious about how much money people make in a certain field or how much other people are dedicating to their savings—you just don’t know how to ask,” Jackson wrote in a social media post teasing the new show.

Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed as earnings results from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) helped revitalize optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and September retail sales data came in ahead of forecasts. After trading higher for most of the session and posting an all-time intraday high, the S&P 500 lost steam in the afternoon to close the session less than 0.1% lower. The Nasdaq eked out a minimal gain of less than 0.1%, while the Dow added 0.4% to print its second straight record close. Health insurer shares moved lower after industry player Elevance Health (ELV) missed profit estimates with its third-quarter results and lowered its guidance for the full year. The company attributed the shortfall to declines in Medicaid enrollments stemming from eligibility redeterminations and other changes. Elevance shares dropped 10.6%, while losses spread to other health insurance stocks with Medicaid exposure. Shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH) plunged 12.6%, the steepest drop in the S&P 500, while Centene (CNC) stock lost 9.1%. CSX (CSX) shares tumbled 6.7% after the freight shipper's quarterly sales and profits fell short of analysts' expectations. Hurricanes Helene and Milton weighed on the company's results, while a decline in coal revenue and lower fuel charges also restrained revenues. Shares of Snap-On (SNA), a provider of tools and equipment for professional users across various industries, soared 10.0% to notch Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500. The gains came after Snap-On released its third-quarter financial results, matching analysts' revenue forecasts but exceeding earnings per share (EPS) expectations. In its largest segment, which sells tools and services to auto repair shops, Snap-On posted 4% quarter-over-quarter sales growth, suggesting a potential turnaround in that key market. The Travelers Companies (TRV) shares surged 9.0% following the insurer's third-quarter earnings report. Despite a year-over-year uptick in catastrophe losses stemming from Hurricane Helene and other severe weather events, Travelers more than tripled its net income compared with the year-ago period, boosted by higher premiums and increased investment income. The company also reported an improvement in its consolidated combined ratio—a key gauge of profitability for insurance companies. Investment management firm Blackstone (BX) reported better-than-expected profits alongside an increase in assets under management for the third quarter, and its shares jumped 6.3%. Blackstone's CEO noted that the firm invested or committed more than $54 billion during the quarter—the highest amount in more than two years. Blackstone's overall fund appreciation during the quarter also reached its strongest level in three years.

Title: USDT Popularity Soars As Tether Adds Over 36 Million Users in Q3 2024

Time Published: 2024-10-17T21:00:58Z

Tether’s USDT, the largest crypto stablecoin, recently celebrated its 10th year in the industry. The company’s growth has been impressive, thanks to its steady user base, holdings that include $97 billion in US government bonds, and its plans to partner with US law enforcement agencies to strengthen its brand. Now, the team behind Tether can find another reason to celebrate: data suggest that Tether’s USDT user growth recorded its best quarter in Q3 by adding 36.25 million new users. The company added that its quarterly user data has increased by 9% on average over the last 12 months, giving it enough cushion as it expands its use cases and applications. In a post at Tether.io, the company boasts of an increasing adoption of its stablecoin, reporting over 330 million in-chain wallets and accounts. The company clarified that these refer to users who have received the stablecoin by the end of the third quarter. This number excludes users who use the coin in centralized platforms such as Binance and Coinbase, which also numbers to several million. An October 16th report indicated tens of millions of Tether customers on these exchanges and off-chain venues. According to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, most users are from developing countries. He explained that the majority of users buy USDT to hedge against inflation and their country’s weak monetary systems. Part of Tether’s success in the industry is its support of tier 1 blockchains like Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain. According to the company, Ethereum-based layer-2 networks contributed the most users this quarter. Last year, Arbitrum and Polygon added the most users to Tether’s pool. Telegram’s The Open Network (TON) was also instrumental in growing Tether’s user base. According to Philip Gradwell of Tether, TON added 3.3 million users in six months, which accounts for 1% of all on-chain accounts. As Tether continues to pick up millions of new users, the company is looking for ways to expand its reach. According to reports, the company is studying ways to enter traditional finance through lending. The company has also invested in a few startups, like Bitdeer, a crypto mining company, and Blackrock Neurotech. However, its most exciting move this year relates to image-building. In a Fox Business interview, Ardoino shared that collaboration with US law enforcement agencies is doing well. If Tether improves its image, we can see more significant user growth in the next few quarters.

Title: Microsoft Stock Earnings: Is It A Buy Before Or After Reporting?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/microsoft-msft-stock-earnings-is-it-buy-before-after-report/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T20:20:23Z
Full Content:
Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report its earnings soon, and investors are keen to see if the tech giant will continue its trend of strong financial performance. With consistent earnings beats in recent quarters and steady stock price growth, it’s worth asking if now is the right time to buy before or after the company’s earnings report. Here’s a breakdown of Microsoft’s historical earnings, recent performance and factors to consider ahead of its report. Over the past eight quarters, Microsoft has demonstrated impressive earnings performance, beating estimates every time for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, except for a single revenue miss. The company has consistently surprised to the upside, with significant EPS beats like 12.9% in first-quarter 2024 and a notable revenue beat of nearly $2 billion during the same period. The strength in Microsoft’s earnings history highlights a pattern of outperforming market expectations, building investor confidence in its financial reliability. These consistent surprises, including a 5.8% EPS beat in fiscal second-quarter 2024, suggest that Microsoft’s earnings reports tend to favorably surprise analysts, which could be a signal for bullish investors looking for an edge. Microsoft’s stock performance has been solid despite market volatility. In the past month, MSFT stock has seen a slight dip of 4.4%, but year to date, it remains up by 12.2%. Over the past year, the stock has gained 25.3%, reflecting its resilience and growth. Microsoft’s five-year performance is remarkable, boasting a 202.8% increase. If Microsoft continues its growth trajectory, discussions around whether Microsoft stock can reach $1,000 could gain traction. Analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus recommendation to buy and a price target range from $420 to $600, well above the current share price of $418.74. This aligns with Microsoft’s strong business fundamentals, including a gross margin of 69.8% and an impressive operating margin of 44.6%.

Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Before diving into the specifics of the earnings, it's crucial to consider various factors that could impact Microsoft's performance. Economic conditions, competitive pressures and evolving market dynamics all play a significant role in shaping results. Investors should also keep an eye on the overall tech sector's health, particularly in relation to AI and cloud computing, where Microsoft has established a strong foothold. Microsoft is expected to continue its strong financial performance. The consensus EPS forecast for the next quarter is 13.15, with estimates ranging between 12.74 and 13.86. On the revenue side, analysts expect $279.21 billion, reflecting Microsoft’s robust revenue growth of 15.7% year over year. These high expectations from analysts show optimism but also set the bar high for the upcoming report. The broader market conditions play a crucial role in Microsoft’s stock performance, especially with the tech sector facing some headwinds recently. Investors should consider the macroeconomic factors impacting tech stocks, including interest rates and inflation, which could introduce volatility around the earnings report. Microsoft’s focus on AI, cloud computing and its growth in enterprise software positions it well for future growth. Recent news includes its strategic partnerships and investments in AI, which could boost future revenue. Microsoft's 0.8% dividend yield and consistent payout add value for long-term investors. Microsoft’s focus on AI also aligns it with other top AI stocks that are poised for growth. Just as Nvidia stock has benefitted from advancements in AI, Microsoft is also expected to capitalize on similar trends. As the scheduled earnings date of October 30 approaches, several key metrics will be vital in evaluating Microsoft's performance. These include trends in semiconductor shortages that could affect production, memory chip pricing and any supply chain disruptions that may have occurred. Given the increasing reliance on technology across sectors, understanding these elements will provide deeper insights into Microsoft's revenue and profitability. Revenue growth remains a key metric for Microsoft. In the previous quarter, Microsoft’s revenue grew by 3.6%, with actual revenue coming in at $56.5 billion, beating estimates by nearly $2 billion. For the upcoming earnings, investors will focus on whether Microsoft can sustain or exceed its growth trajectory, particularly given its expansion into AI and cloud computing. With an operating margin of 44.6% and a gross margin of 69.8%, Microsoft’s profitability is another critical aspect of the earnings report. Investors will watch for any changes in operating income, especially given its strong Ebitda growth of 26.7% year over year, as it reflects the company’s operational efficiency.

The strength of Microsoft’s customer base in key areas like Azure and enterprise software will be pivotal. The company has managed to grow its earnings per share by 21.9% year over year, which ties directly to its expanding customer base. A continuation of this trend would be a positive signal for long-term growth. Guidance is an essential part of the earnings report, offering insights into the company’s outlook. Microsoft typically provides projections that help investors assess the company’s growth trajectory. Analyzing this guidance helps investors understand the management's expectations and can significantly influence MSFT stock movement. If guidance exceeds market expectations, it could indicate robust future performance, whereas conservative projections may raise concerns. Deciding when to invest in Microsoft stock surrounding earnings reports is a critical consideration for investors. Buying before earnings can lead to significant gains if the report exceeds expectations. However, this strategy also comes with risks, including increased volatility. Conversely, purchasing after earnings allows for a more informed decision based on actual performance, yet it may result in missing out on potential price jumps. Buying before earnings can offer opportunities for early positioning and potential gains if the results are positive. However, this approach carries the risk of heightened volatility, as stocks can react sharply to earnings surprises. Additionally, investors may find themselves acting on limited information, which can lead to poor decision-making if expectations are not met. Pros Cons Purchasing after earnings presents its advantages, as it allows investors to make decisions based on actual performance rather than speculation. This can reduce the risk of significant losses if the stock reacts poorly to the earnings report. However, waiting until after the earnings release could mean missing out on a rally if the stock jumps in response to strong results. Furthermore, the market may overreact, leading to corrections or rebounds that savvy investors might miss. Pros Cons Investor sentiment plays a major role in stock price movement around earnings reports. Microsoft’s history of beating earnings estimates often fuels bullish sentiment, but the broader market sentiment, particularly in the tech sector, can introduce volatility. A positive outlook from the market can bolster MSFT stock prices, while negative sentiment may result in a downturn. Analysts often emphasize the need to understand how investor psychology interacts with earnings results, as this can lead to exaggerated reactions, impacting the stock's short-term performance. Understanding the pulse of market reactions before and after the report is crucial for timing your investment. Experts consistently view Microsoft as a solid investment, particularly with its expansion into AI and cloud computing. As the earnings report approaches, expert opinions become invaluable. Analysts provide context and insights that can shape investor expectations. By examining expert assessments, investors can gain a clearer picture of how Microsoft's performance aligns with broader market trends. This analysis can guide decisions on whether to hold, buy, or sell shares. Microsoft has a strong track record of earnings beats, but the decision to buy before or after earnings hinges on your risk tolerance. With robust growth in key areas and a bullish analyst outlook, investors need to carefully consider the pros and cons of each approach. Revenue growth, operating margins and customer growth in cloud and AI businesses. Microsoft’s next earnings report is expected on October 30, 2024, post-market hours. You can listen to the earnings call on Microsoft’s investor relations website. A miss in earnings could result in short-term volatility, with the stock price potentially dropping.

Title: Analyst Explains What Could Drive Bitcoin’s Price ‘Above $500,000 Before the Decade Ends’

On October 16, Real Vision’s Chief Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts shared a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in light of growing institutional support. Coutts emphasized that a significant shift in asset allocation preferences is happening, spurred by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s endorsement of Bitcoin. Coutts said that with BlackRock’s Aladdin platform—used by sovereign wealth funds and major asset managers for modeling and attribution—offering seamless Bitcoin integration through its ETF, the path for Bitcoin to rise further has been paved. Coutts predicted that even a small shift in institutional allocations from traditional assets like sovereign debt to Bitcoin could push the price of BTC beyond $500,000 by the end of the decade. Coutts’ current analysis echoes points he made in a 17 April 2023 post, where he outlined the risks posed to bondholders by Bitcoin’s rise. He noted that debasement—resulting from excessive money printing and swelling global debt—is a growing issue for portfolio managers, and Bitcoin has increasingly served as a hedge against this trend. At that time, Coutts had argued that Bitcoin, with its disinflationary supply and growing adoption, could replace bonds as an essential component of diversified portfolios, especially as government bonds have consistently underperformed against rising monetary supply. Even then, Coutts suggested that if just 1% of the global bond market shifted to Bitcoin, it could push the price of BTC to around $185,000. In his recent post, Coutts revisited this theme, pointing out that during the last bear market, Bitcoin had outperformed bonds, commodities, and many equities, reinforcing its strength as a long-term store of value. He noted that traditional asset classes had not adequately compensated managers for the risks they faced in an era of low real returns and high inflation. The shift away from bonds is now inevitable, according to Coutts, despite government mandates for bond purchases or new banking regulations, as Bitcoin emerges as a more viable alternative. Coutts added that the rise of Bitcoin in portfolios of massive sovereign wealth funds is still feasible, even with liquidity challenges. He argued that with BlackRock now actively promoting Bitcoin and other major institutional players offering the necessary tools for risk modeling and portfolio attribution, the ongoing debasement trend will only strengthen Bitcoin’s position. In his opinion, every time a fund manager opts for Bitcoin over sovereign debt, it further validates this shift. With #crypto bro Fink endorsing #Bitcoin's portfolio-enhancing qualities, a seismic shift in asset allocation preferences is underway. @BlackRock's Aladdin platform, utilized by the largest sovereigns and money managers, provides the tools for modelling and attribution while… https://t.co/gxaxwBRdTP pic.twitter.com/FeNKnggUuf Featured Image via Pixabay The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

Title: 2025 NFL mock draft: Ashton Jeanty surges up board, Travis Hunter remains No. 1

As the leaves start to fall in mid-October, so do the hopes of some NFL fan bases. And with college football officially reaching the midway point of its regular season, the time has come to revisit our early 2025 first round mock draft. As the only teams without a loss this season, the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs and upstart Minnesota Vikings are two of the biggest stories of the early NFL season. A hot start does not guarantee the Lombardi Trophy, of course, so for the purposes of this mock draft, we simply took the reverse order of the current Super Bowl odds via DraftKings to create the selection order. [Related: Why Travis Hunter is an unprecedented prospect] Individual players' stocks will fluctuate in the months leading up to the draft, but at this point, cornerback, running back and linemen appear to be this year's strongest positional groups. That could make things interesting for teams like the Carolina Panthers, Cleveland Browns and Las Vegas Raiders, all of whom might be considering another reboot at quarterback in a draft currently featuring more questions than answers at the position. 1. Carolina Panthers: Travis Hunter, CB/WR, Colorado The Panthers are the worst team in the NFL in just about every meaningful statistic, so new GM Dan Morgan and head coach Dave Canales have lots of work in front of them. Carolina has won a total of three games over the past two seasons and currently ranks dead last in points allowed (33.8 per game) and 28th in points scored (17.2). As such, the Panthers should exhaust all opportunities to trade out for more picks in a massive rebuild — which is precisely what I projected in last month's mock draft — but if forced to pick here, taking Hunter, the best player in the class, makes the most sense. 2. New England Patriots: Mason Graham, DT, Michigan No one needs to tell Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo about the impact quality defenders can have on a franchise. The 6-foot-3, 318-pound Graham was a rare true freshman starter at Michigan and bulldozed his way into First Team All-Big Ten honors a year ago with 36 tackles, including 7.5 for loss and three sacks. Paired with blossoming star Keion White, the Patriots could have the makings of a dominant defensive line. 3. Cleveland Browns: JT Tuimoloau, Edge, Ohio State Clearly, the Browns were expecting more with the acquisition of Deshaun Watson, but the club is essentially trapped by his massive contract, making a switch at the position unlikely. A boost to the offensive line would also be nice, but I don't see a blocker worthy of this pick. Instead, the Browns may shift their attention to the Buckeyes. With "just" 14 sacks over his first three years at the college level, Tuimoloau has not produced the eye-popping production some expected, but don't let the stats fool you. The power-packed 6-foot-5, 279-pounder turned down a chance at a first-round selection to return to Ohio State for a possible title run. I anticipate he will play his way into a top-10 selection next spring. 4. Las Vegas Raiders: Shedeur Sanders, QB, Colorado Sanders boasts many of the traits to project as a franchise NFL quarterback, but some will be turned off by his flashy personality. The Raiders have never shied from charisma and might see Sanders as the perfect jolt to the roster. His anticipation and accuracy — especially in the intermediate zones — would complement the investments Vegas has already made in early round tight ends Brock Bowers and Michael Mayer. 5. Tennessee Titans: Will Johnson, CB, Michigan While the Titans have other, bigger concerns on the roster, Johnson is arguably the top overall player in this class and is not likely to fall out of the top five. He offers a future Pro Bowl combination of size, speed, physicality and ball skills. The 6-foot-2, 202-pounder projects as an immediate difference-maker, similar to the Broncos' Patrick Surtain Jr. 6. Jacksonville Jaguars: Benjamin Morrison, CB, Notre Dame Three cornerbacks selected in the top six would be historic, but given the talent of this year's class, it's possible. The Jaguars certainly could use the help for a secondary that currently ranks last in the NFL in passing yards allowed (1,660) and touchdowns allowed (14) through the first six games of the season. A true ballhawk with nine interceptions recorded over his first two seasons, the 6-foot, 186-pound Morrison is well known for his soft hands and instincts in coverage, but scouts also like his reliability as an open-field tackler.

Los Angeles Rams: Will Campbell, OT, LSU With an aging quarterback, protection is key. An immediate standout who earned Second Team All-SEC honors as a true freshman, Campbell ascended to First Team honors in 2023, showing off the size, agility and strength to warrant a top-10 selection for a club that needs help on the offensive line. 8. New York Giants: Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State The selection of any running back this high will be panned by some, but special players deserve exceptions. The Giants are clearly missing the breakaway element that former top-10 pick Saquon Barkley provided and could see Jeanty as the quickest way to add spark to a middling offense. Jeanty's burst to and through the hole is exceptional, and he's a true three-down back, possessing both soft hands and physicality in pass protection. 9. Arizona Cardinals: Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State Ever since James Franklin took over at Penn State, the Nittany Lions have churned out edge rushers, and all indications are that Carter has "got next." Even while splitting duties with 2023 top-100 draft picks Chop Robinson and Adisa Isaac, the 6-foot-3, 250-pound Carter earned First Team All-Big Ten honors with 5.5 tackles for loss, including 4.5 sacks. 10. Denver Broncos: Nic Scourton, Edge, Texas A&M The Broncos already boast an ascending edge rusher in Jonathon Cooper and a versatile defensive lineman Zach Allen, but the former is in a contract year and will be expecting a big pay day. At 6-foot-4 and 280 pounds, Scourton combines prototypical size with good snap anticipation and power, projecting nicely as a two-gapping defensive end who would give Sean Payton & Co. some needed flexibility up front.

Miami Dolphins: Malaki Starks, S, Georgia The hope, of course, is that quarterback Tua Tagovailoa recovers from his latest concussion and remains healthy throughout the rest of 2024, justifying the massive $212 million dollar contract he signed in the offseason. If not, one of the top remaining quarterbacks (like Georgia's Carson Beck or Texas' Quinn Ewers) might be a strong consideration, as their anticipation and accuracy could make either a fine fit in Mike McDaniel's scheme. Let's remain optimistic that Tagovailoa returns, allowing Miami to focus elsewhere. Starks is a versatile safety with immediate impact potential, especially if plugged into a secondary already loaded with playmakers. 12. New Orleans Saints: Luther Burden III, WR, Missouri The Saints started the season on fire, scoring a combined 91 points in two victories, but they've stumbled since, losing four straight while scoring only 76 total points. Frankly, I think the Saints could use some grit at receiver. Powerfully-built at 5-foot-11 and 208 pounds, Burden could be the physical complement to the speedy (but injury-prone) Chris Olave.

Indianapolis Colts: Tyleik Williams, DT, Ohio State The Colts currently rank 31st in the NFL in rushing yards allowed (931 through six games) and could also use more pass rush from the interior. Williams isn't the biggest defensive tackle (6-foot-3, 327 pounds), but he's cat-quick and surprisingly powerful. He would add some youthful vigor to a front that is currently missing veteran DeForest Buckner, who has been on IR with a high ankle sprain. 14. Seattle Seahawks: Emery Jones Jr., OT, LSU Quite literally, a "big" reason why the Seahawks have lost their past three games has been ineffective play at right tackle. Seattle has young talent developing, but might jump at the chance to land a big bruiser like Jones, a three-year starter with plus size (6-foot-5, 320 pounds) and athleticism.

Los Angeles Chargers: Colston Loveland, TE, Michigan Few coaches prioritize tight ends like Jim Harbaugh, and he might jump at the opportunity to reunite with Loveland, one of the better all-around pass-catchers in this class. With just six touchdown receptions to his credit, Loveland likely won't generate first-round buzz from the analytics crowd, but the 6-foot-5, 245-pounder possesses the soft hands and balance through contact to be a monster in the middle in the NFL. 16. Pittsburgh Steelers: Jalen Milroe, QB, Alabama With his dual-threat abilities, Justin Fields has helped the Steelers start the season 4-2, but with Mike Tomlin considering a switch to Russell Wilson, clearly he doesn't see the former as an obvious long-term solution at quarterback — at least not yet. Regardless of which veteran ultimately pilots Pittsburgh for the rest of this season, the Steelers might pounce should a dynamic talent like Milroe fall into their lap. Milroe has made strides this season and boasts the upside to perhaps contend for QB1 honors in 2025. 17. Chicago Bears: James Pearce Jr., Edge, Tennessee Don't look now, but Caleb Williams and the Bears are starting to click on offense and have rattled off three consecutive wins. To capitalize on a suddenly explosive offense, the Bears may want to add to an already formidable pass rush with an explosive edge rusher like Pearce, who registered 10 sacks a season ago and, like the Bears, seems to be warming up after a slow start to the 2024 campaign. 18. Dallas Cowboys: Isaiah Bond, WR, Texas While veteran Brandin Cooks has proven to be a quality complementary threat to CeeDee Lamb when healthy, his inability to remain on the field has slowed the Cowboys' offense. Bond possesses similar straight-line speed as Cooks and would be a popular fit with an increasingly frustrated fan base.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona With five touchdowns over the first six games of the 2024 season, Mike Evans remains one of the NFL's best red-zone weapons. However, the Bucs could be looking for a younger and cheaper version, especially as the 10-year veteran's cap hit balloons from $5.56 to $22.38 million next season. Boasting similar size and hand strength to reel in jump-balls, McMillan would make a lot of sense. 20. Cincinnati Bengals: Deone Walker, DT, Kentucky While most are understandably focusing on the Bengals' struggling offense, one of the reasons why Cincinnati has started the season a disappointing 2-4 is a leaky run defense that has surrendered a combined 874 yards on the ground and seven touchdowns. Football is a big man's game, and they don't come much bigger than the 6-foot-6, 346-pound Walker, who earned Second Team All-SEC honors from league coaches a year ago after leading the Wildcats in tackles for loss (12.5) and sacks (7.5), despite fighting almost constant double-teams. 21. New York Jets: Carson Beck, QB, Georgia Aaron Rodgers will turn 41 in December, and with Tyrod Taylor (35) the only other quarterback on the roster, it seems obvious New York will be drafting a QB next spring. While ideally that might come later in the draft, I don't think GM Joe Douglas will wait if an ideal fit falls into their lap here. Beck possesses the size, arm and pro-style experience to project as a franchise quarterback, though he's raised more questions than answers with his inconsistent play so far this season.

Washington Commanders: Kelvin Banks, OT, Texas Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels has breathed life into a once-proud franchise, but if he is to enjoy long-term success, Washington needs to get some more ‘Hogs up front. Banks lacks ideal size, but his quickness and balance have made him a star at left tackle at Texas, and some believe his best fit in the NFL is at left guard. Regardless, the pro-ready Banks could be money in the bank for a franchise needing help up front. 23. Atlanta Falcons: Walter Nolen, DT, Mississippi Nolen captured the imagination of scouts with a breakout sophomore season at Texas A&M, and he has emerged as one of the nation's better, more disruptive DTs this season with the Rebels. He's on pace to shatter his previous career-highs in tackles (37), tackles for loss (nine) and sacks (four) and is even more disruptive than his numbers suggest. Given that the Falcons have an NFL-worst five sacks over their first six games, GM Terry Fontenot and defensive-minded head coach Raheem Mostert will almost certainly be looking to boost their front in the offseason. Walter Nolen has emerged as one of the nation's more disruptive defensive tackles in the nation, even more impactful than the numbers suggest. (Photo by Peter Joneleit/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) 24. Green Bay Packers: Cameron Williams, OT, Texas Similar to the Commanders two picks ahead of them, the Packers have emerged as one of the more exciting teams in all the NFL, in large part due to the stellar play from their quarterbacks, primarily starter Jordan Love. Now the challenge is protecting him. Williams is one of this year's quickest ascending prospects, starring at right tackle for a pass-heavy and pro-style Longhorns program that should ease his transition to the NFL. 25. Philadelphia Eagles: Jalon Walker, Edge, Georgia The pipeline from Athens to Philadelphia could continue should the twitchy Walker still be on the board at this point, especially with the Eagles potentially looking for replacements for pending free agent edge rushers Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham. General manager Howie Roseman selected five former Georgia Bulldogs over the 2022-23 NFL drafts and might see Walker's burst and bend as the perfect way to bolster the pass rush while maintaining a tight salary cap. 26. Buffalo Bills: Denzel Burke, CB, Ohio State The first cornerback didn't come off the board until No. 22 overall this year, but Burke is part of a very intriguing class that, at least at this point, looks like one of the strongest of any position for 2025. Silky smooth in coverage, Burke just needs to show more ballhawking skills to earn a first round pick, as he had turned just two of his 26 career pass breakups into interceptions heading into this season. He intercepted a pass in the Buckeyes' season-opening win against Akron, showing the blend of traits and untapped potential Sean McDermott has always prioritized.

Houston Texans: Derrick Harmon, DL, Oregon As the Texans continue to light up scoreboards with their explosive offense, it will be critical for the club to add playmakers on defense. Harmon is one of the fastest-rising prospects in the country, emerging this year for the Ducks after transferring from Michigan State. At 6-foot-5 and 330 pounds, he possesses both NFL-caliber girth and power to collapse the pocket, something that defensive-minded head coach DeMeco Ryans will appreciate. 28. Minnesota Vikings: Mansoor Delane, CB, Virginia Tech While certainly not (yet) as celebrated as some of the other cornerbacks of this class, Delane is quietly earning first-round grades from scouts. Like the surprising 5-0 Vikings, he is flying a bit under the radar, but has turned heads already this season. He also is a three-year starter with impressive size (6-foot-1, 187). The Vikings' cornerback room is older than most, with 35-year-old Stephon Gilmore starting in his 13th NFL season. 29. Detroit Lions: Kenneth Grant, DT, Michigan With three defensive tackles set to hit free agency after this season, the Lions will be looking for size and strength on the interior this fall. They may not have to look far as the defending national champs boast two of the more dominant prospects at the position in Grant and the previously listed Mason Graham (No. 2 overall to New England). The 6-foot-3, 340-pound Grant was the headliner on Bruce Feldman's annual "Freaks" list, boasting a rare speed and power combination that should earn him a first round selection and perhaps help the Lions regain their roar, while another former Michigan star, Aidan Hutchinson, recovers from his horrific season-ending leg injury. Kenneth Grant boasts a rare speed and power combination that should earn him a first round selection. (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) 30. Baltimore Ravens: Aireontay Ersery, OT, Minnesota The Ravens have three offensive tackles playing in the final year of their respective contracts this season, including standout left tackle Ronnie Stanley. A phenomenal athlete at 6-foot-6 and 330 pounds, Ersery possesses the size and agility to warrant first round consideration, and he might love being reunited with his former Minnesota teammate Daniel Faalele, now the Ravens' starting right guard. 31. San Francisco 49ers: Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky Even with injuries limiting some of their best players early this season, the 49ers remain the NFC favorite to reach the Super Bowl. One veteran playing well — and likely expecting a big contract soon — is cornerback Charvarius Ward. Cash-strapped, San Francisco may have little choice but to look to the draft for a cheaper replacement for Ward. Hairston plays with a similar brand of physicality. 32. Kansas City Chiefs: Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State Given the quick ascent of rookie wideout Xavier Worthy, wide receiver is not a massive need for the Chiefs. However, general manager Brett Veach has won big by simply playing the Best-Player-Available strategy so far and the polished Egbuka certainly would qualify as that, providing Patrick Mahomes with yet another talented pass-catcher and the franchise some insurance should injuries and other off-field concerns limit Rashee Rice in the future.

Data from Farside Investors shows that total net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs have now hit $20.2 billion. And that’s even accounting for the $20 billion that has fled from Grayscale’s fund. In the ETF world, flows are the amount of money coming in and out of a product. They are a good measurement of how well a fund is performing as it shows how active the vehicle is. Investors have put billions of dollars into the funds but have also cashed billions out of Grayscale’s GBTC. Grayscale’s investment product previously operated like a closed-end fund, making it difficult for investors to redeem shares. Its conversion in January led to a flood of capital out of the product as investors sought cheaper ETFs or cashed out their gains. But Grayscale clients are more or less done cashing out, it seems, and money is fast entering Bitcoin ETFs from other issuers again—particularly this week, with nearly $2 billion in inflows already. Of the 10 ETFs currently trading, Wall Street titan BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust has received the lion’s share of inflows, with over $22.4 billion, Farside numbers show. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that gold ETFs took five years to reach the same overall flows as what the Bitcoin ETFs have notched in 10 months. Bitcoin ETFs have crossed $20b in total net flows (the most imp number, most difficult metric to grow in ETF world) for first time after huge week of $1.5b. For context, it took gold ETFs about 5yrs to reach same number. Total assets now $65b, also a high water mark. pic.twitter.com/edldEimfqd — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 17, 2024 ETFs allow investors to buy shares that track the price of an underlying asset, which could be anything from gold and foreign currencies to Bitcoin and tech stocks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January after a decade of denials. A flood of capital fast entered the space following the approval of the products as investors and institutions previously cautious about buying the cryptocurrency could do so via brokerage accounts; major asset managers like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity take care of custody and buying and selling the digital coins. Speculators then slowed down putting cash into the products when it was uncertain what the Federal Reserve would do regarding historically high interest rates. But following the central bank’s decision to cut last month, investors have again gained an appetite for “risk-on” assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s price currently stands at $67,373, according to CoinGecko, after having risen by nearly 11% over seven days. Just two months after the Bitcoin ETFs were approved, the biggest digital coin hit a new all-time high of $73,737. Balchunas previously told Decrypt that Bitcoin, which has had its share of ups and downs this year, would have struggled to retain its value had it not been for the new investment vehicles trading on American stock exchanges.

Title: Vice Bosses Talk Next Steps Following Bankruptcy And Tease New Production Finance Facility That Will Make It A “One-Stop Studio Shop”
URL: http://deadline.com/2024/10/vice-business-model-production-finance-facility-1236117304/

By Diana Lodderhose International Features Editor EXCLUSIVE: This year has seen a swath of global production and distribution entities in film and television impacted by layoffs and cuts, and Vice Media Group has been no exception. Following the company’s much-publicized bankruptcy in 2022, when it was sold for $350 million to hedge fund and former investor Fortress, the group underwent a raft of layoffs and restructuring earlier this year, with its production business, Vice Studios Group, now being led by Jamie Hall in London and Danny Gabai in Los Angeles. But Hollywood loves a comeback, and Vice Media CEO Bruce Dixon tells Deadline in a rare interview that Vice is back from the brink in a smaller capacity but with a clear vision and money to spend — the latter in the form of an imminent production finance facility, which it hopes to launch before the year end. Watch on Deadline “There’s no doubt that the business is far healthier than it was a year ago,” says Dixon. “One of the things I want to focus on is obviously culture and morale – it’s a tough industry to be in at the moment but we’re feeling positive because we have become a far more agile company.” The Vice chief says he expects the company to be in profit in Q1 2025. “We’re smaller, we take opportunities where we can now and, more importantly, we’re backed by our investors and our board in terms of looking for opportunities for growth and exciting projects.” Today, the company is operating at 30% of its size compared to the beginning of the year. Dixon says this leaner operation – and particularly its global production entity Vice Studios Group, which is behind projects such as Gangs of London, the Saoirse Ronan feature film Bad Apples, Netflix doc Lewis Capaldi: How I’m Feeling Now and upcoming hybrid musical/doc Pavements – means it can better adapt to the changing market. Key to this, Dixon says, will be the introduction of a production finance facility, which it is currently at the “advanced stages” of securing. The London-based exec says he was recently in LA working on securing the production facility which will, he says, help propel the company’s strategy to move its studio business into a “more IP-based” content business and will enable it to be a “one-stop studio shop.” “We were forced to be a camera for hire for so long and that had more to do with our corporate resources than anything else,” says Dixon. “So, being able to break through what we went through in a much-publicized bankruptcy, we’re now focusing on the positives of being in the content business.” He continues: “We’re recognizing that we’ve always had that skillset, but we’ve just never had the financial capability to go out and be the super studio – which we have all the skills for, but we’ve never been able to put something up front on projects and get involved at earlier stages. That’s somewhat hindered us. It hasn’t hindered our creativity, but it’s hindered our output and our ability to improve margins and be a more successful financial business.” Vice Studios Group co-president Gabai notes that with streaming services and many premium cablers “moving away from a world where they do all-rights buyouts,” the introduction of a facility will better enable Vice to compete on a global scale for content via co-financing agreements or co-productions. “We do so much global production in the UK and other territories that, for us, it feels like there are more opportunities for windowing,” he says. “There’s an opportunity for a studio player out there who can really step into that role and fill the gap on productions that may be launching out of the UK, or other territories, and we can give them that extra piece of resource that they would need to go into production.” While Dixon couldn’t reveal any more details about numbers or timing on the finance facility, he did indicate that he was hopeful it will launch “before the end of the year.” “It’s something that is a priority for us and we hope to close it soon,” he says. “But it will allow us to have more possibilities as a company and allows us to be a little more opportunistic in our ideas, while also bringing more certainty around the projects we are doing.” Vice Media Group, which moved out of the online news game earlier this year, has trimmed down to focus on its Virtue ad agency and Vice TV, a joint venture with A&E, in addition to its studio business. Meanwhile, Vice Digital, a culture hub publishing content on and around Vice’s platforms, which Dixon notes was a “massive financial burden for us,” has since relaunched under a new joint venture with Nashville-based Savage Ventures. In the company’s tumultuous 18 months, one bright spot has been its global production business Vice Studios Group, which has a distribution catalogue of more than 1,000 hours and oversees five premium production entities: Pulse Films, UnTypical, Vice Studios LatAm, Vice Studios Canada and a news documentary unit. By the end of 2024, the group expects to have produced 21 projects including Pulse Films-produced Pavements, from director Alex Ross Perry, and Sky Original and Pulse Films series Atomic, starring Alfie Allen and Shazad Latif, the latter of which wrapped in Morocco last summer. The company is currently shooting the third season of British crime drama Gangs of London (seasons 1 & 2 launched on Netflix in September as part of a wide-ranging deal with AMC Networks) and also premiered Jason Pollard-directed doc Ol’Dirty Bastard: A Tale of Two Dirtys at the UK’s Doc’n Roll Film Festival. Vice Studios and Viral Nation recently announced the development of unscripted series Montana Boyz (working title), about TikTok cowboys Kaleb Winterbrun, Mark Estes and Kade Wilcox. “This will be the largest production year we’ve ever had, which is crazy when we are coming out of a bankruptcy,” says Gabai. “We’ve had this happen with all of the headwinds going on around us and a really tough marketplace, but now those headwinds are behind us.” Gabai notes that he and fellow Co-President Hall had previously restructured the studio business when Vice Studios and Pulse merged a few years prior to the bankruptcy. “I think, to some extent, the studio has been operating with the benefit of a very tightly knit group of people for a couple of years,” he says. The manifesto for the studios business is to focus on director-driven talent: “We tend to work with really great filmmakers and, oftentimes, if they’re not already huge household names when we start working with them, they tend to grow into big names off the back of doing projects with us.” This year, Vice reunited with its Fyre documentary director Chris Smith for Devo, a doc about the band of the same name which launched in Sundance earlier this year. It is also producing Hollywood Ending, from Tiger King director Rebecca Chaiklin, via its UnTypical strand, which follows the downfall of Zach Horwitz, the charismatic “midwestern, millennial Madoff” who ran a $690M Ponzi scheme under the noses of those closest to him. The latter was picked up by Amazon MGM. “I used to say in my agent days that talented people are always talented,” says Gabai. “Whether somebody’s having a hot moment or a cold moment or they’re making a million things at once, or they haven’t worked for a couple of years – if someone is really talented and attacks their projects in an interesting way, that’s somebody we want to bet on.” It was this vision that ultimately led Vice Studios to bringing aboard Listen Up Philip director Ross Perry to helm Pavements, a documentary/fiction hybrid about the venerable U.S. indie rock band Pavement fronted by Stephen Malkmus. Pavement is best known for songs such as “Cut Your Hair” and “Stereo,” which they released through Matador Records. The Pulse Films-produced project, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival last month and is having its UK premiere at the London Film Festival today, intimately shows the band preparing for their sold-out 2022 reunion tour, while simultaneously taking the audience behind the scenes of the making of a musical, a museum and a spoof Hollywood biopic, featuring Jason Schwarzman as Matador Records founder Chris Lombardi and Joe Keery as Malkmus. Matador Records and Pavement were keen to do something “totally different” says Gabai, and he says that “this felt like a good opportunity to take the piss out of a standard music documentary.” “Alex was the top director on my list and Stephen seems like the character that Alex would have written about and created,” says Gabai. For Ross Perry, he was drawn to the “big, structural conceit of the film: “I just thought this movie should take place in a world where Pavement are as worthy of every form of tribute as say, the Rolling Stones, The Beatles or David Bowie because, for a few 100,000 people, that’s true,” he says. “In the spirit of the band, we wanted to put this whole endeavor in quotation marks, in the way they put the idea of being a successful band in quotations.” Pavements, says Gabai, is a prime example of the kinds of projects Vice Studios will aim to back going forward. “It’s always filmmaker first for us. Everything we do is driven by the filmmaker or the showrunner or the core creative on any project, what they want to do with the material on that project and what they want to say about this crazy world that we live in while doing it in a way that is fun and entertaining.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: Charging ahead: Key reasons for confidence in a commercial EV trucking future

By Maaz Haider As the world grapples with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, the impacts of climate change have become a tangible concern for millions of people. Among the largest contributors to this crisis is transportation, the largest source of U.S. emissions, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles have an outsized impact. Hence, reducing transportation emissions is essential. Transitioning to zero-emission trucks will slash climate and air pollution everywhere, improve local economies by creating new jobs, strengthen national security by reducing our dependence on imported oil, and save fleets money on fuel — all of which are especially critical now. While uncertainties remain about the ultimate pace of scaling zero-emission medium- & heavy-duty vehicles, this presents an opportunity for innovative partnerships. By working together to address challenges, we can accelerate the transition to zero-emission trucks and reinforce the transportation sector’s commitment to a sustainable future. Infrastructure improvements: The backbone of EV success The industry has made significant strides in developing charging infrastructure to support electric trucks. Private investment, as well as support from government programs, is beginning to address the infrastructure challenge. Fueled by public and private funds, there are now around 183,000 public charging ports in operation within the U.S. as of Q2 2024–well on target to meet Biden’s administration goal of half a million public ports by 2030. The funds allocated under the Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Law through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program and the Charging & Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grants program are actively being awarded and implemented. Three charging sites in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania are already operational under NEVI, with 47 additional projects announced under CFI, which will deploy over 5,000 Level 2 chargers and more than 600 Level 3 fast chargers. Efforts led by other private groups solidify the future of public charging in the country. Notably, Forum Mobility will be deploying 1,000 DC fast chargers in California. Furthermore, Greenlane, a partnership between Daimler, NextEra Energy and BlackRock, to develop a nationwide network of high-performance charging stations starting with a 280-mile corridor between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Recently, a group of carriers and shippers, which includes AIT Worldwide, DB Schenker, Maersk, Microsoft, PepsiCo and others, have formed a coalition to pilot heavy-duty charging with Terawatt Infrastructure along the I-10 corridor. Technological advancements: Breaking the range barrier and demonstrating reliability and performance Advancements in battery technology continue to improve the capacity of electric trucks, including adding range and reducing charging times. Legacy manufacturers like Daimler and Freightliner, along with new entrants such as Nikola, Tesla and Windrose, are leading the charge in electric truck innovation, offering impressive ranges on a single charge. Tesla’s Semi truck promises a range of up to 500 miles with PepsiCo, one of the early adopters of the Semi, having successfully integrated these trucks into its fleet for regional distribution. Real-world data from Pepsi’s deployment has successfully accomplished a 1000+ mile journey in a single day. Further data revealed by NFI which also piloted the Tesla Semi’s reveals impressive efficiency statistics surpassing performance expectations and highlighting the vehicle’s long-range capabilities. Another new entrant in the market is Windrose with their EV trucks offering upwards of a 400-mile range at full load. As per the Zero-Emissions Technology Inventory, or ZETI, tool there are currently 21 different OEMs, or Original Equipment Manufacturers, offering 24 different EV van and truck models with a range of 200+ miles. Financial incentives and operational savings: The economic argument While the sticker price of electric trucks is higher compared to traditional diesel trucks, as per BloombergNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2024, due to battery cost reduction and efficiency improvements, zero-emission trucks’ cost parity can be reached even sooner with the urban duty cycle becoming cost competitive before 2030. Furthermore, subsidies and tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act and public grants can help offset the upfront capital costs. Specifically, IRA provision 45W allows fleets to reduce the cost of an electric truck by up to $40,000, while provision 30C enables savings of up to 30% on the cost of installing charging infrastructure. Moreover, the total cost of ownership savings outlook for electric trucks is further amplified due to savings on fuel and maintenance. Titan Freight Systems demonstrated these cost savings for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks in a presentation at the ACT Expo 2024 showcasing 10% and 7% savings in these applications respectively. The savings will increase as more EVs are deployed since the cost of existing charging infrastructure will be spread across a larger fleet Make like bamboo: From laying the groundwork to rapid growth and advancement The growth of EVs and charging infrastructure in the U.S. can be likened to the growth of a bamboo shoot. After years growing deep roots with little visible growth above ground, bamboo suddenly shoots up rapidly, symbolizing how foundational work leads to swift, visible progress. Similarly, the EV industry initially experienced slow adoption, focused on building the necessary technology, regulatory frameworks and consumer awareness. However, with these strong foundations now in place, thanks to policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, NEVI, and other initiatives, the industry is experiencing rapid growth, much like bamboo’s sudden upward shoot. According to the EDF Electric Fleet Deployment & Commitment tracking tool commercial EV deployments grew 5 times with more than 10,000 Class 2b-8 EVs deployed in 2023 followed by more than 15,000 EVs deployed year to date in 2024. The EV industry’s steady groundwork is enabling companies in the U.S. to quickly expand their EV truck fleets, making significant strides toward sustainable transportation.

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) briefly reached a new intraday high on Thursday after its Taiwanese chipmaking partner beat earnings expectations. The chipmaker’s stock was up around 2.8% during mid-day trading on Thursday, at about $139.51 per share. Earlier in the day, the stock briefly climbed over 3% to set a new intraday record of $140.89 per share, according to CNBC. The stock’s last record intraday high was on June 20, when it reached $140.76 per share. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-2.43%) shares were up around 12% during mid-day trading on Thursday after it beat earnings expectations for the third quarter. The Taiwanese chipmaker reported revenue of NT$759.69 billion, or $23.5 billion, for the quarter ended September 30. Third-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year in U.S. dollars, TSMC said, and was up 12.9% from the previous quarter. In New Taiwan dollars, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) both rose 54.2%. TSMC was expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+1.23%) as its main customers, has seen its shares rise over 107% so far this year. Meanwhile, shares of Nvidia fell over 4% earlier this week after closing at a record high. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD-0.19%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.

TSMC was expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” Wendell Huang, TSMC chief financial officer, said in a statement. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC, which counts Nvidia and Apple (AAPL+1.23%) as its main customers, has seen its shares rise over 107% so far this year. Meanwhile, shares of Nvidia fell over 4% earlier this week after closing at a record high. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD-0.19%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported.

Leading today’s Green Deals is an exclusive discount on Anker’s latest SOLIX C300 DC 90,000mAh/288Wh Portable Power Station that drops costs to a new $148 low price while also giving you some free gear. Next, we spotted Samsung’s AI-supported Bespoke All-in-One Electric Washer & Ventless Heat Pump Dryer starting from its $1,800 Best Buy low, with some additional chances to save. We have two great Greenworks deals – one on the 40V 20-inch Cordless Electric Push Mower that just hit a new $304 Amazon low, with a more advanced combo bundle that gets you a mower, blower, and string trimmer. Bringing up the rear is a one-day-only discount on GoTrax’s Z4 LITE Folding e-bike that has dropped it back to a $600 low. Plus, all the other hangover Green Deals in the links at the bottom of the page, like yesterday’s coverage of the latest sales on Velotric’s e-bikes and NIU’s KQi e-scooters, and more. Head below for other New Green Deals we’ve found today and, of course, Electrek’s best EV buying and leasing deals. Also, check out the new Electrek Tesla Shop for the best deals on Tesla accessories. We’ve got an exclusive chance for 9to5Toys readers to save more money than before on Anker’s newest SOLIX C300 DC 90,000mAh Portable Power Station while getting some free gear all for $148 shipped, after using the promo code 9TO5PBANK26. Down from a $200 price tag, we’ve already seen a few discounts for this unit since it first hit the market in August, with the biggest of them being its $150 launch price which we just saw repeat for the first time at the tail-end of last month. It’s getting beaten out here today though, as this promotion gives you a slightly bigger 26% markdown that saves you $52 and sets a new all-time low price. Not only does it beat out Anker and Amazon’s current markdowns to $180, but it also comes with a free USB-C charging cable as well as a carrying strap which hasn’t been offered with the station since its early-bird launch special. Anker’s SOLIX C300 DC power station arrives in a compact 90,000mAh/288Wh unit that easily stores away inside your bag, delivering up to 300W of power output for your more personal devices. This model boasts the first of Anker’s inclusions of boosted recharging speeds that you can take advantage of by using its two bidirectional 140W USB-C ports at the same time for up to 280W speeds. There’s also the bonus option of recharging its battery via a 100W solar panel that refills it in 3.2 hours. You’ll have a solid variety of output connection options with its four USB-C ports (a 15W port, a 100W port, and the two 140W ports), two 12W USB-A ports, and a 120W auxiliary port. Taking a note from its predecessor, the 60,000mAh PowerCore Reserve, Anker has continued the trend of including an integrated pop-up LED light in the C300 DC power station that provides three different brightness levels that can be used as a camping lantern or emergency light source. While you can monitor and adjust settings through the companion app via a Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, it also provides readouts on its display too. Best Buy is having a Samsung savings event through October 20 that is cutting costs on a lineup of Samsung devices and appliances to update and upgrade your home life, with the brand’s Bespoke AI 5.3 Cubic-Foot All-in-One Electric Washer & Ventless Heat Pump Dryer down at $1,799.99 shipped. Normally going for $2,800 at Best Buy, with a greater $3,324 price tag direct from Samsung, we saw it fall to its lowest rate back in June when Costco offered a short-lived markdown to $1,600, while Best Buy last saw its $1,800 low during Labor Day sales. It’s returning here today though, offering up $1,000 in savings while also offering $50 rewards for My Best Buy Plus and Total members. Bargain hunters can also save an additional $278 when buying this model in excellent open-box condition. One thing to note before we dive into its capabilities is that Samsung has this washer & dryer currently marked down to $1,999 shipped, with its open-box option being slightly higher than Best Buy’s at $1,599 (click the “add” box to the side), which does balance out the differences in cost with a few added benefits with either purchase. First, you’ll get two years of Samsung Care+ for just $1 over its usual $149 price on top of getting free installation too. This ENERGY STAR-certified all-in-one washer & dryer arrives AI-supported for less time consuming and easier managed laundry routines that you don’t have to babysit. The AI programming in this model lets the unit detect different fabric types and adjust its own settings in response to their soil levels. Its detergent tank has been given a larger capacity than we often see in these appliances, holding up to 47 loads worth of detergent before needing a refill – plus, its Flex One compartment takes the convenience to the next level as it can be split between 25 loads of detergent and 34 loads of softener. As is the case with models in the green category, we cannot gloss over the biggest design feature here: its ventless heat pump design. Not only does it allow you to rethink its placement in your home (as it doesn’t need to go where the one vent is located like standard models and plugs into a standard wall outlet), but its dual-inverter heat pump tech also significantly increases energy efficiency while working in conjunction with the AI system to calculate and predict your electricity costs to “reduce energy usage by up to 19%.” It’s also been given self-cleaning and self-drying tech to keep laundry coming out fresh, smart controls via the SmartThings app (as well as hands-free voice controls too), the EPA’s seal of approval, and much more. Head below to learn about the rest of what this appliance can bring to your home. Be sure to check out the entire lineup of Samsung appliances and devices that are benefitting from Best Buy’s sale, like tablets, TVs, PCs, laptops, monitors, and more that we covered when it first launched. You can also check out the direct offers from Samsung here. The colder months may be setting in on us, but lawns still need to be kept up and deals can often be better in these fall and winter months. Amazon is following this line of thinking as it offers the Greenworks 40V 20-inch Cordless Electric Push Mower for $303.98 shipped. Usually goes for $400, which isn’t too bad of a starting price for an electric mower (compared to some of the bigger high-end models). We’ve seen a few discounts over 2024 that bring costs down even lower, most repeating the same drop to the former $320 Amazon low, but today those rates are beaten out by this even greater 24% markdown that takes $96 off the price tag and lands it at a new Amazon low. Powered by the included 4.0Ah battery, this Greenworks mower’s 40V brushless motor delivers a nice uniform cut for yards up to 1/3 acre in size after one round of charging. Everything is housed within a 20-inch steel deck crowned by LED headlights for those early morning and late evening jobs, while the folding handles “saves 70% more space in seconds with vertical storage.” There are seven different cutting height levels to choose from here, as well as a 4-in-1 design that does the usual mulching, side discharging, or rear-bagging for your grass clippings on top of a turbo leaf pickup setting for a bit more versatile use. Of course, you’ll never have to struggle with a pull string here either, as it has been given a convenient push-button start to compliment its electric functionality. For folks looking to expand their lawn care arsenal beyond just a mower, Amazon is also currently offering a Greenworks bundle of an 80V 21-inch Self-Propelled Cordless Electric Lawn Mower, an Axial Leaf Blower, and a 16-inch String Trimmer at its lowest price of $630, down from $900. You’re getting a more advanced mower here that offers most of the same features as the above model, trading its turbo leaf pickup for an improved self-propulsion system alongside a greater runtime that can tackle yards up to 1/2 an acre. There’s also the Axial leaf blower that hits 580 CFM for yard-clearing power with a turbo mode and even cruise control locks, as well as the attachment-capable string trimmer with a bump feed head, variable speed control, and a load n’ go spool for faster and easier re-spooling. Courtesy of its Deals of the Day, Best Buy is offering the GoTrax Z4 LITE Folding e-bike for $599.99 shipped for the rest of the day. Normally priced at $900, we’ve seen it listed at higher rates between $900 and $1,100 from other third-party retailers. We’ve seen a few of these one-day discounts drop costs on this entry-level model, first to $650 at the start of summer, and then some repeated falls to $600 in July and August. After a lull on price cuts until now, this is a chance to save yourself $300 while also grabbing this commuting solution at the lowest price we have tracked. The GoTrax Z4 LITE e-bike makes a great first-time choice for riders looking to enter the e-bike world without dropping serious cash right away, delivering 20 MPH top speeds and an impressive traveling distance of up to 40 miles on a single charge (25 miles when you only use the throttle). The triple-folding frame design houses the 350W motor and the removable 48V battery while providing easier storage and transport options when not in use. It also comes along with 20-inch fat tires, dual front and rear braking, an integrated headlight and taillight that provides brake light functionality, a rear cargo rack, a kickstand, and a digital display. The savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Title: Nvidia Stock Hits Another Record High as AI Chip Excitement Returns
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-stock-hits-another-record-high-as-ai-chip-excitement-returns-8729823

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) set a fresh record intraday high Thursday as a blowout earnings report from supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) eased concerns that the semiconductor market was stalling. TSMC posted a 54% year-over-year jump in profit and a 39% rise in revenue in the third quarter on artificial intelligence (AI) chip sales, and the company predicted demand would continue into the future. That offset news earlier this week from Dutch semiconductor maker ASML Holding (ASML), which warned that the recovery in non-AI chips was taking longer than anticipated. Adding to the positive feelings about Nvidia were comments from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller about his sale of the company's shares. The Duquesne Family Office CEO said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that "it was a big mistake" to dump all his stake, adding, "I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale there." Nvidia shares were recently up 2.7% to $139.39 after earlier Thursday touching a record $140.89. They have nearly tripled since the beginning of 2024. TradingView

Title: Tech Troubles: Digital Era Downsides (And How To Solve Them)
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/10/17/tech-troubles-digital-era-downsides-and-how-to-solve-them/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T17:15:32Z

Advances in technology have introduced revolutionary process and service upgrades for businesses in recent years. Digital tools have enabled remote work and global hiring, streamlined (and sometimes taken over) repetitive processes, improved customer service and outreach, and more. However, progress often comes with pain points, and the growing use of technology in business has raised some serious security, social, ethical and sustainability concerns. Below, members of Forbes Technology Council reflect on some of the downsides of the digital era they’ve observed, as well as why it’s essential to acknowledge and address these issues. The growing use of artificial intelligence is causing a drastic increase in data center power consumption, straining traditional infrastructure and contributing to environmental peril. However, data centers that adopt distributed energy solutions like microgrids can mitigate these issues with localized, sustainable and scalable power, ensuring they remain resilient and energy-efficient in the face of rising AI demands. - Ravi Prasher, Bloom Energy The increasing reliance on technology has notably shortened the attention span of today’s workforce. Establishing dedicated “focus time,” when we deliberately avoid using our devices, can help. Additionally, silencing phones, minimizing nonessential notifications and creating tech-free zones are effective strategies to combat distractions and boost productivity in an ever-connected world. - Batul Bohara, Amazon.com Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? In the race to leverage transformative technologies, it can be easy to lose sight of the critical role only humans can play in the outcomes they deliver. Embracing today’s powerful technologies requires managing the risks they bring, and organizations that rank empathy, critical thinking and creativity among the workforce skills they value will have an edge in meeting these challenges. - Merav Yuravlivker, Data Society Like many, I see the issues with all things related to security, but another big problem is the loss of focus on critical thinking and individual creativity. The rapid evolution of AI has created a vast number of use cases, but that shouldn’t result in the elimination of individual thought. Combining the power of AI technology with experiential human knowledge and creative thought creates more robust solutions more quickly. Foster an environment that embraces combining the power of creative thought with the power of technology. - Johanna Baum, S3 Consulting Business data doubles almost every three years due to advanced technology. The concern is where to go from here. Do we let the data explosion continue freely? There are technologies that can actively delete data and files based on document retention policies and regulations. Such services not only help us manage the volume of data being stored, but can also protect corporations from unnecessary risks in the future. - Kazuhiro Gomi, NTT Research One negative impact of technology’s growth in business is the rise of job displacement due to automation. To address this, companies can invest in reskilling and upskilling programs, empowering workers to adapt to new roles and technologies. This fosters career growth alongside tech advancements. - Tina Gada, Vanguard Group Despite investing billions in software and point solutions, organizations in complex industries (like construction and manufacturing) are plagued by disconnected systems and data. A “one size fits all” approach to technology doesn’t work; instead, look for simple, custom-fit solutions capable of solving problems in a single platform, unlocking the potential of every employee to make an impact. - Ed Jennings, Quickbase The breadth of software modern workers need to get their jobs done and the siloed nature of teams makes IT sprawl a very real problem, contributing to sunken costs and security risks. One way to mitigate this is to look for and choose solutions within your existing business platform. This approach can help organizations better manage identity security, ensuring people have only the access they need to get their work done. - John Milburn, Clear Skye One negative impact of growing tech use is the rise in electronic waste, as businesses frequently upgrade devices. To address this, companies can implement e-waste recycling programs and invest in longer-lasting, repairable technology. Promoting a circular economy reduces environmental harm while fostering a more sustainable tech life cycle. - Miguel Llorca, Torrent Group One negative impact of growing technology use in business is the rise of employee burnout due to constant connectivity and blurred work-life boundaries. To address this, companies can implement “digital wellness” policies, such as enforcing regular breaks, setting boundaries on after-hours communication and promoting time off to ensure employees can disconnect and recharge effectively. - Nicola Sfondrini, PWC The digital divide creates a stark gap between those with access to technology and those without, deepening socioeconomic inequalities. Rural areas and low-income communities often face limited access to high-speed internet, devices and digital literacy. To bridge this divide, we must invest in infrastructure, affordable access and education, ensuring equitable opportunities in a rapidly digitizing world. - Vamsi Krishna Dhakshinadhi, GrabAgile Inc. Messaging on Slack and meeting online is undeniably convenient, but I also think it’s overused. As a leader, when I can, I like to meet in person, pick up the phone or use a means of connecting that is even just one degree more “human.” We talk a lot about creating human-centered software, but we can also choose to do without the software and just be human. - Lindsey Witmer Collins, WLCM “Welcome” App Studio As businesses digitize, a key issue is data privacy. The vast amount of personal information collected increases the risk of breaches. To address this, companies should implement privacy-by-design frameworks, encrypt sensitive data and promote transparency in how data is used. This builds customer trust while ensuring compliance with evolving data protection regulations. - Jagadish Gokavarapu, Wissen Infotech One negative impact of growing technology use is the rise in algorithmic bias, where AI systems unintentionally perpetuate social biases in decision making, from hiring to credit approval. To mitigate this, businesses should implement continuous bias audits and develop explainable AI frameworks to ensure transparency and fairness, while involving diverse teams in the AI development process. - Andrii Kovalchuk, WeSoftYou Inc. A negative impact from the rise of generative AI is that people are accepting its outputs as truth, without question. It’s not always the case that GenAI’s responses are correct. Generative AI creates an answer instead of looking for one—it will sometimes create incorrect answers, and people should be aware of that. - Gonçalo Ribeiro, YData In my sector (public health), many experienced health workers are not tech-savvy. Adding technology tools can help community-based organizations sustainably grow, but for many community health workers, the transition is not easy. It’s difficult but essential to strike a balance between opportunity and sustainable social change. - Syam Adusumilli, GroundGame Health Data intolerance is growing in businesses. Have you ever tried to search an organization’s website for useful information? Good luck. The chronic lack of searchable data strangles productivity, stifles creativity and foments employee burnout. Answers aren’t as simple as “you know, AI” or “get search.” Unbreaking search requires careful, policy-based data planning, executive buy-in and deep technical talent. - James Stanger, CompTIA One downside of the growing use of technology in business is that people tend to become too dependent on it. This makes companies vulnerable when their systems fail or they’re hit with cyberattacks. To minimize risk, businesses should develop effective backup plans, diversify their tech tools to avoid reliance on a single system, and regularly train employees to handle unexpected issues. - Sergii Malomuzh, Rewump

Major U.S. indexes were higher at midday Thursday, as a strong report on demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips boosted the tech sector. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all advanced. Nvidia (NVDA) supplier TSMC (TSM) reported profit soared on demand for AI chips, sending its U.S.-listed shares to an all-time high. The news helped drive Nvidia shares to a record high as well. Blackstone (BX) shares also surged to a fresh high after the asset manager said its profit jumped as it brought in more investments. Elevance Health (ELV) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the insurer reported a weaker-than-expected profit and lowered its guidance as changes in Medicaid slashed membership rolls. Shares of CSX (CSX) dropped as the freight shipper’s results missed estimates and it cut its outlook as Hurricanes Helene and Milton impacted operations. Lucid Group (LCID) shares sank as the struggling luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker announced a $1.67 billion stock sale and warned it would have a larger quarterly loss than expected. Oil and gold futures rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed. The U.S. dollar gained on the euro and yen, but lost ground to the pound. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were lower.

The case that Ozempic (NVO-0.14%) and other GLP-1 medications could help people with substance use disorders is getting stronger. Blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs, known as GLP-1 treatments, could help people struggling with alcohol and opioid addiction, according to a new study published Thursday in the scientific journal Addiction. In a retrospective study, researchers found that patients with opioid use disorder who had a GLP-1 prescription had a 40% lower rate of opioid overdoses compared with those without a prescription. Additionally, people with alcohol use disorder with a GLP-1 prescription had 50% fewer instances of alcohol intoxication compared with those without a prescription. Researchers from the Loyola University Chicago made the findings by analyzing the medical records of over 500,000 patients with substance use disorders. GLP-1s are a class of diabetes and obesity medications that mimic a hormone that interacts with a region of the brain – the mesolimbic system – to reduce appetite and trigger satisfaction after eating. Demand for these medications has turned Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly (LLY+0.07%), the producer of Mounjaro and Zepbound (both GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss), into the largest pharma companies in the world. Ozempic and prescription weight loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Additionally, the mesolimbic system overlaps with the brain processes that influence addictive behaviors. This overlap suggests that these medications may “modulate the reward-response pathways associated with substance use,” the study authors wrote. The study follows other anecdotal evidence from patients and healthcare providers that suggests GLP-1 drugs can help users curb addictions. A Morgan Stanley (MS+1.36%) survey from earlier this year found that people using GLP-1 drugs — among them Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound — reduced their consumption of tobacco. The investment bank surveyed approximately 300 GLP-1 users about their consumption habits while taking the medication. While 40% of survey respondents said they smoked cigarettes at least weekly before starting a GLP-1 treatment, that number fell to 24% after they started the treatment. Meanwhile, weekly e-cigarette usage dropped from 30% of respondents to 16% after they started taking a GLP-1. The analysts noted they were “cautious about drawing conclusions” from their survey about the impact of GLP-1 drugs on addictive behaviors. While research hasn’t yet proven a causal link, clinical trials are currently underway to better understand the effects of GLP-1s on alcohol and tobacco consumption. One small trial found that people with alcohol use disorder drank less after taking semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic — compared with people who took a placebo.

Title: How CIOs Can Maximize ROI On Enterprise AI Platforms

Plus: AI Policy Records Of Trump And Harris, Apple And Nvidia See Their Values Increase, Companies To Improve AI Get Investments, AMD And Intel Join Forces On x86 Collaboration Even though neither of the candidates on major presidential tickets are talking much about AI, it’s a huge area of concern for tech leaders. Nearly three in four tech leaders said the election will have a major impact on whether the U.S. tech sector will be able to stay ahead of global competitors, according to a poll published this week by EY US. Specifically, they said, it will impact cybersecurity and data protection, AI and machine learning, and user data and content oversight. There are very few issues that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are even remotely close to agreeing on, so this result from the poll isn’t a surprise. But it’s worth taking a look at what may happen in terms of tech policy if either candidate is elected. As a part of President Joe Biden’s administration, Harris supported the executive order he signed last year to place guardrails on the use and development of AI. The executive order mandates guidelines and standards for government use of AI, requires government oversight of AI models that could pose a risk to national security, and essentially sets the stage to ensure privacy, equity and civil rights are protected through the use of AI technology. Harris spoke about the order days after it was signed at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London, saying it is possible to ensure ordinary people are protected from AI misuse—like explicit deepfake images of them being shared, or insurance claims being denied because of faulty AI algorithms—and not stifle broader innovation. When Biden signed the executive order last year, several tech CEOs were immediately on board and had been working with the federal government to develop AI regulations. Trump said last December he plans to cancel Biden’s executive order if elected, and that he’d also “ban the use of AI to censor the speech of American citizens on day one.” There hasn’t been much else published about what Trump would do instead, though a rundown by law firm Winston + Strawn indicates he has said that AI’s power to distort can be “scary,” and the threat AI could pose to security requires immediate attention. When Trump was president in 2019, he signed an executive order for the federal government to direct more funding to AI R&D and work toward building governance standards. Tech executive and self proclaimed “free speech absolutist” Elon Musk has been close to the Trump campaign, and Musk has used his social platform X to share his view that the First Amendment can protect campaign-related AI deepfakes and reproductions of copyrighted images. Trump has not endorsed Musk’s views, but he could be influenced by them. But no matter who wins the election, 87% of tech leaders told EY they plan to increase AI investments by 50% or more in the next year, with most saying they want to reallocate existing resources toward AI. So even if the election has a huge impact on larger policy, businesses will stay on the journey to implement the technology to make their work more efficient and useful. Even for a technology like AI, which many are committed to investing in, companies need to examine the ROI for systems they want to adopt. I talked to Anurag Malik, president and CTO of legal AI platform company ContractPodAi, about how to determine this and get the greatest value out of AI investments. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Nominations for Forbes’ CIO Next List are now open. If you know any CIOs who are making an outsized impact on their company or business, please let us know about them here by November 8. Apple introduced its new iPad Mini this week. Apple’s stock surged to an all-time high on Tuesday, with the tech company briefly being worth $3.61 trillion. The likely catalyst was the announcement of a new iPad Mini model, which is the first update to that model since 2021. The new iPad Mini, which is available for pre-orders now and goes on sale next week, has a powerful A17 processor that will work with the company’s Apple Intelligence features when it launches later this month, writes Forbes senior contributor David Phelan. It also has 128GB of storage in its basic configuration, which is twice that of earlier models. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said lead times for the iPhone 16, released last month, are “encouraging,” and the 56 million iPhones shipped last month was 10% more than expected, writes Forbes’ Derek Saul. Apple’s share price moderated a bit on Wednesday, but it will be both rolling out Apple Intelligence and reporting earnings at the end of the month, so more big changes can be expected. Nvidia’s stock has also been rallying for much of October, and is nipping at Apple’s heels as the current second most valuable company by market cap. Nvidia’s stock surge, fueled by optimism and encouraging words about demand from CEO Jensen Huang, briefly moderated on Tuesday. Dutch firm ASML, which makes equipment used to manufacture high-end AI chips, mistakenly reported earnings a day early and warned of “more gradual growth” to come, with 2025 revenue projections well below analysts’ expectations. ASML’s share price fell 17.5% on Tuesday, bringing down stock for Nvidia and other AI chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices, Arm Holdings and Broadcom. But the rally picked back up again Thursday morning, when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported blockbuster earnings and increased its revenue guidance. TSMC’s stock went up more than 12%, boosting its market cap above $1 trillion, and taking chip stocks including Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom and Intel with it. Decagon cofounders Jesse Zhang (left) and Ashwin Sreenivas. Two startups focused on improving AI platforms raised large Series B rounds this week. Decagon, a platform that builds AI customer service agents, raised $65 million in a round led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from tech investor Elad Gil and VC firms Accel and Bond Capital, writes Forbes’ Rashi Shrivastava. Decagon, whose agents are used by companies including Notion, Duolingo, Rippling, Bilt and Substack, is now valued at $650 million, with $100 million in total funding to date. The company plans to use the funds to grow its team, go after new types of customers and add a voice feature. Galileo, a startup that evaluates AI models to ensure they aren’t hallucinating or giving out proprietary data when prompted, announced a $45 million funding round, writes Forbes’ Richard Nieva. The round was led by Scale Venture Partners, with participation by Premji Invest, venture arms of Citibank and the data storage company Databricks and Hugging Face founder Clem Delangue. The three-year-old company, which offers four products to help companies train and evaluate their AI systems, says it has raised a total of $68 million to date. getty As technology changes, competitors are becoming allies. Intel and AMD announced the creation of an x86 ecosystem advisory group this week, dedicated to bringing tech industry leaders together to come up with consistent and compatible implementations for a variety of applications and platforms using x86 architecture. Forbes senior contributor Patrick Moorhead talked to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and AMD CEO Lisa Su about the rival companies—they still will be competitors, Su and Gelsinger told Moorhead—coming together now to give x86 processors the same kind of alignment found in the Arm processor ecosystem. Su told Moorhead that customers have likely been wanting this kind of arrangement for decades to make it easier on their software stack, and working with Intel on the standards is “a major benefit for our customers and for the ecosystem.” The two CEOs said the industry cooperation will help speed innovation and build market opportunities for x86 processors going forward. Most of Big Tech is represented in the group, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, Broadcom, Dell, HP, HPE, Lenovo, Oracle, Red Hat, Tim Sweeney of Epic Games and Linus Torvalds of the Linux Foundation. ContractPodAi President and CTO Anurag Malik. Whenever a company wants to add new tech, even the most bullish will question its ROI. I talked to Anurag Malik, president and CTO of legal AI platform company ContractPodAi, about how companies can get the most out of their investments in AI technology. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do most companies go about trying to figure out the ROI of generative AI? Malik: We are all running a business. Most companies buying a product are doing it for return on investment, with or without AI. I think the onus lies on the product provider to show that value. Value can come in many ways. It could be time saved, people being redirected to something more efficient, cutting down on outside spend. We think of AI as something that’s not going to take jobs away, but it’s going to make you much more efficient. You’ll be able to do much more of what you used to do before with limited resources, especially repeatable tasks, mundane tasks, which is very easy for AI to pick up. One thing we do is show productivity dashboards within the product, which shows time saved, number of tasks finished in whatever amount of time. We let our buyers input how much time it takes them today. Then we do a comparison: This is how long it’s taking you now, and you can put in a dollar value to the labor and then get ROI. One of the shortfalls is people tend to map existing processes to a technology, which is very different from how they were do[ing] things manually before. Helping them bridge that and re-imagining how they would use the technology to do things different[ly] and be much more productive is something the provider should do because the buyer is new to our technology and it’s on us to guide them. It’s more of a consultative way of selling AI and educating the customers as we go along. When a company is looking to adopt AI, or any sort of tech system that will definitely change the way they do things, should they be thinking ROI first, or should they be thinking about long-term capabilities? Being long-sided on this is way more valuable. In fact, when we onboard customers, we tell them, “Hey, we all walk and run.” As cliche as it sounds, you can’t go from zero to 100 miles an hour in two seconds. This is not a Tesla. This is a new system. There’s people involved who have to learn to use it. So let’s get the low-hanging fruits. You may not see it’s better than what you do today. You may not see humongous ROI, but if you get people on board and make them get used to the product, the road down is going to look much more productive for you. Absolutely, that long-term vision is very necessary. Software providers have to educate their customers to see that, to give them that vision. Because remember, everybody who comes to buy technology is trying to solve a pain point today. They’re not trying to see what’s going to happen in three years down the line. Yes, they’re invested in it, but if you educate them well enough that, hey, you're not only going to solve this pain point today, but if you take a step back, you can see the vision of how you can really transform how you’re doing things. What are some of the things that get in the way of companies realizing the ROI potential that they have with AI? Adoption. The distance to change is the biggest thing I’ve seen. Especially global companies: different regions, different teams. For it to go from one region to another is the biggest challenge. One thing I’ve seen is if you get the first one right and make a good story of it, educate teams wherever in the world they are, it works very well. The first success story is very important. It doesn’t matter how well your software works. If people are not going to use it, it’s as good as crap. Adoption and change management—making people understand [they need] to change the way they do things—is very important. Even more important than the actual technology itself. Amazon entered into agreements with Dominion Energy, Energy Northwest and startup X-energy to fund development and deployment of small modular reactors—small and advanced nuclear reactors—to create the power needed for AI datacenters. $500 million: Amount invested in X-energy for these reactors, anchoed by Amazon 960: Megawatts of power to be created by the four SMRs Amazon is helping Energy Northwest develop. This is enough to power the equivalent of 770,000 homes ‘Nuclear is a great option for how we scale the world’s energy needs’: Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told Forbes Executives are faced with an avalanche of tasks that can be difficult to prioritize. Here’s how to use the Eisenhower Matrix—a streamlined and simple way of thinking about things—to help decide where to invest your time and energy.

GE Aerospace (GE) will report earnings for the third quarter Tuesday morning, at a time when the aerospace industry faces some uncertainty with Boeing (BA) workers on strike. Analysts expect GE Aerospace's quarterly revenue to rise to $9.35 billion from $8.41 billion a year ago, when GE Aerospace was still a part of the General Electric conglomerate. The former GE division split from the energy-focused GE Vernova (GEV) earlier this year, while GE HealthCare (GEHC) was spun off last year. Shares of GE Aerospace have surged over 40% since the April 2 split from GE Vernova. Analysts expect the stock could rise further, with all of the eight analysts tracked by Visible Alpha holding "buy" or equivalent rating and an average price target of $210.38, implying about 9% upside from Thursday's intraday price of $192.84. Bernstein analysts, recently raising their price target to $225 from $201, wrote GE Aerospace could be "well-positioned for the short, medium, and long-term" because of its combination of new engine sales and its "huge installed base" of existing engines, "which drives a powerful, profitable aftermarket." However, GE Aerospace faces a "key question" in this quarter's earnings report, as the analysts said investors will be looking for details on how much of an impact the ongoing Boeing strike will have on production, which could impact GE's engine sales. Deutsche Bank analysts also raised their price target to $235 from $212 earlier this month, and said GE Aerospace remains one of their "top ideas" in the aerospace sector.

Chip stocks rose Thursday after the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), reinvigorated Wall Street’s AI enthusiasm with better-than-expected quarterly results and a rosy financial outlook. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) advanced about 2% on Thursday morning, led by TSMC, up 12%. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) climbed more than 3%, while Nvidia (NVDA), the chip designer at the heart of the AI craze, rose 2%, as did chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM). TSMC on Thursday morning said net income increased by more than 50% in the third quarter, far exceeding Wall Street’s estimates. CFO Wendell Huang attributed the company’s results to “strong smartphone and AI-related demand.” CEO C.C. Wei estimated that the contribution of AI processor sales to TSMC’s total revenue would triple this year. The results underscored the diverging fortunes of companies within the broader semiconductor industry. Pockets of the industry are still grappling with an inventory glut that has persisted for more than a year amid sluggish consumer demand. "While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” said Christophe Fouquet, CEO of Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (ASML) earlier this week. ASML’s warnings sparked a semiconductor sell-off, sinking the SOX index more than 5% on Tuesday. Despite Thursday’s TSMC-led rally, the index remained 3% below its Monday close.

At Meta Connect in September, one of the newest products that caught my eye was a limited-edition pair of Ray-Ban glasses -- with a transparent frame, sapphire transition lenses, and a fairly accessible $429 price tag. Since I've already had great experiences with the Meta Quest 3 and Viture Pro XR glasses, I decided it was time to try the highly praised smart glasses by Meta. Fortunately, I was able to buy a pair right as stock ran out. Only 7,500 units were made available worldwide, and mine is number 4,255, marked on the inside of the right frame and on the charging case. ZDNET's Kerry Wan reviewed the standard Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses last year, and after months of use, he still enjoys their functionality. As announced at Meta Connect, existing Meta glasses will also receive software updates, including natural language processing, the ability to remember and recall key information, live translations, and more. Also: I've tested a lot of tech in the past 6 months - the Meta Ray-Bans were the biggest surprise While deciding whether to make the purchase, I intended to use the glasses to capture video that's difficult to record accurately with a camera or smartphone. This includes testing watches, fitness gear, and e-bikes, as well as creating vertical short-form videos for YouTube and Instagram, with both hands free to interact with devices. I've used action cameras for some of this content before, but I wanted to see if a first-person perspective would result in better footage. Reviewed by ZDNET, the smart glasses can record videos, play Bluetooth audio, and perform useful AI tasks. I also spend time fly fishing, where both hands are occupied, and I want to capture video and still images of these experiences to share with family and friends who don't want to wade through cold rivers and catch small trout. My large, energetic cat demands daily playtime with wand toys, and now I can easily record his incredible acrobatics and funny antics on the go. It's been over two weeks since my Meta Ray-Ban Wayfarer Limited Edition glasses arrived, and they've exceeded my expectations. In addition to capturing great video while running with new watches, testing e-bikes, fishing, and playing with my cat, I've recorded a few fights on the ice at a local minor league hockey game, playful snow leopard kittens at the zoo, and my daily commute as the fall leaves turn under a glowing sunset. You can now capture up to three minutes of video by setting that as the default length, and the audio quality during recording has been much better than I expected. Also: New Meta Ray-Ban AI features roll out, making the smart glasses even more tempting Beyond video and still capture, I now prefer using the glasses for calls and podcasts over my AirPods Pro while walking around downtown Seattle. Like the bone conduction headphones I use for running, the Ray-Ban glasses leave my ears open for better awareness of my surroundings, and the sound quality is good for podcasts and music. However, in heavy traffic, the sound can be too quiet, so a future version with bone conduction technology would be ideal. I also appreciate the various messaging options, especially being able to have messages read aloud and easily reply to friends and family. Keeping my phone in my pocket while commuting and wearing the Meta glasses feels like an optimal way to get around. I'm enjoying spending less time looking at screens and more time engaging with the world around me. The transition lenses are a game changer as well. They allow me to wear the glasses both indoors, where I listen to music, make hands-free inquiries with Meta AI, and handle calls and messaging, and outdoors, where I would normally switch to sunglasses. However, I wish the lenses would get a bit darker in full sunlight. Also: In a surprise twist, Meta is suddenly crushing Apple in the innovation battle - Prism The Engo 2 Photochromic glasses have improved my running performance by displaying key health stats, and it would be fantastic to see similar functionality in a future version of the Meta glasses. Even being able to ask Meta for running stats would help me keep my eyes on the road and stay focused on my goals. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase of this Limited Edition model of the Meta Ray-Bans, which is designed to give me a glimpse into the underlying technology. And I'm even more excited about the added utility that future updates will bring.

The consensus price target is $732.26, about a 4% premium to to Wednesday's $702 close. The price targets used to determine that average vary from $550 to $820. Analysts expect the streaming giant to post year-over-year revenue, profit, and subscriber growth ahead of the final quarter of 2024. Netflix shares dipped following the company's quarterly reports in April and July. The shares were down more than 1% in morning trading, leaving the stock up more than 40% this year.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Nuclear energy is currently attracting exorbitant interest to meet the soaring demand from data centers throughout the continental US as the nation prepares to tap the century-defining potential that AI offers. Now, Craig-Hallum has upgraded the stock price outlook of NuScale, citing its regulatory head start and "a meaningful pipeline and customer list, including in AI/data center applications." Connect the Dots A. Google announcement a few days back.B. Microsoft with 3 mile island.C. Ellison? Oracle with 3 SMRs.D. Apple and META are next! — Lawrence McDonald (@Convertbond) October 16, 2024 The so-called Mag 7 companies have been aggressively pivoting towards nuclear energy in recent months to meet their soaring energy demands from AI-related workloads. By now, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon have all announced their plans to tap nuclear energy via either the conventional route or the so-called SMRs, which are small-scale, modular reactors, with an as yet unproven track record. Moreover, it appears increasingly likely that Apple and Meta might also announce their nuclear-focused deals soon. also known as the "Next AI Trade", or "Power Up America", laid out to subs in April. This is the best performing basket of 2024, outperforming even the Broad AI tradehttps://t.co/3WxL99fSed https://t.co/ovOOjMtaAl pic.twitter.com/ngeAtKsR6C — zerohedge (@zerohedge) October 16, 2024 In fact, so fierce is this nuclear-focused tailwind at the moment that it has been dubbed the "next AI trade." According to HSBC, data centers can account for 9 percent of the total electricity consumption in the US by 2030. Logically, nuclear energy provides the only sustainable, zero-carbon option to meet this oncoming demand. NUSCALE POWER $SMR price-target raised to $21 (from $16) at Craig-Hallum, saying a nuclear power "renaissance" is underway, and we are at the beginning of a "multi-decade megatrend": "A nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which… — Stock Talk (@stocktalkweekly) October 17, 2024 This brings us to the crux of the matter. Craig-Hallum has now raised NuScale's stock price target to $21 per share, citing a secular tailwind from a nuclear power "renaissance" that is likely to evolve into a "multi-decade megatrend. The investment bank notes: "As part of this shift, small modular nuclear reactors have a real place in multiple applications, especially in support of the urgent need for zero-emissions baseload power for AI/data centers." For the benefit of those who might not be aware, SMRs pair high energy densities with a reliable, zero-carbon power output, making them ideal for data centers. Like all fission reactors, SMRs use a controlled nuclear chain reaction to produce steam that then drives turbines. Increasingly, companies such as Oklo are adopting liquid metals as coolants in their reactors. Most SMRs, however, require low-enriched uranium (HALEU) as the primary fuel, which is in short supply at the moment, given the sanctions on Russia. Do note that NuScale experienced a considerable setback recently when the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) terminated the company's only SMR project, which was also the first of its kind in the US, citing cost overruns. However, the company continues to develop projects in South Korea and Romania. Coming back, Craig-Hallum states in its investment note that is out today: "Activity over the last few months has been building and reached a fever pitch over the last few days with high-profile nuclear announcements (including SMRs) by Google and Amazon." It goes on to note: "While not involved specifically in either deal, we see NuScale as ideally positioned for an acceleration of nuclear/SMR adoption with a 5+ year regulatory head start and a meaningful pipeline and customer list including in AI/data center applications."

Title: The Dow rises 150 points on strong retail sales and surging AI stocks

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged Thursday morning, driven by robust retail sales data and a rally in chip stocks. Consumer spending saw a notable increase in September, reflecting growing economic momentum following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts. A report from the U.S. Census Bureau revealed that retail sales climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% for the month, an improvement over August’s unchanged 0.1% gain and surpassing the 0.3% rise predicted by economists. In addition to the boost in consumer spending, the labor market continued to display resilience. Weekly initial unemployment claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 241,000—a drop of 19,000 from the previous week and below the forecasted 260,000. This decline signals sustained strength in the job market. In the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129 points, or 0.3%, to 43,207. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, AI and semiconductor stocks were among the day’s top performers. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%), Micron Technology (MU-0.81%), and Broadcom (AVGO-0.91%) gained 3%, 3.9%, and 4%, respectively, as investor optimism in the sector continued to grow. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Expedia (EXPE+0.97%) stock is climbing Thursday morning after a report that Uber (UBER-0.94%) has looked at buying the travel booking company in what would be its largest acquisition yet. The Financial Times on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the process, reports that Uber has met with advisors in recent months after a third party brought up the idea. A focus of those discussions, which the Times says are still at a very early stage, was Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who joined Uber 2017. — Rocio Fabbro and William Gavin contributed to this article.

Title: College basketball rankings: CBS Sports Top 100 And 1 best teams for the 2024-25 season

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The hope. The anticipation. Sneakers squeaking. Basketballs bouncing. Whistles chirping. Coaches already in full-throat before the season is in full throe. Find a quiet spot and, if you really try hard enough, you'll hear college basketball building for its long-awaited return in the first week of November. College hoops season is less than three weeks away, but more than 360 teams across the United States have been ramping and tuning up for weeks. We're all just about ready to tip this thing off — and angst grows as we lurch toward Nov. 4. Once the games begin, we can only hope the phantasmagoric will arrive as scheduled — but without a hint of its imminent entry, for maximum impact — as this beautiful mess of a sport is sure to take us on another great journey of joy, shock and madness. Ah, we know it will. We just don't know the when, who, how or why. That's why we love this sport so much. Before we get another college basketball campaign going, let's zoom out and lock in. As has been the case for a decade now, I've foolishly and enthusiastically taken to a master preseason ranking of teams. My methods are uncomplicated but diligent: examine the rosters, check in with coaches for intel, evaluate programs based on recent success (or a lack of it), factor in (and try to discern) inevitable surges and fades, and mostly avoid preseason metrics as to not be influenced by the (often accurate) biases of algorithms. Oh, and: Be sure to just let a few inexplicable predictions rip and hope for the best. A note on this year's process. With the Big Ten and ACC now 18 teams, plus the Big 12 and SEC beefing up to 16 apiece, I found myself wrestling a bit with how to place power-conference teams from about the No. 60 spot and below. Will we see the 79 teams from the power conferences (Big East has 11 and is also in that class) all mostly wind up as top-100 teams in most ratings systems by season's end? Will most of the 79 work their way into the top 70? Is the deck going to prove to be stacked that much in their favor? Or will a dozen-or-so mid-majors break through and find themselves ranked in the top 60? I think that's still possible, and my predictions reflect that, but if it skews toward the big boys in massive ways, I'll take that into consideration a year from now. I want to see how this new world of mass high-major expansion impacts the universe of college hoops, however that winds up playing out. Once more unto the breach, away we go! In what feels like a wide-open season just over the horizon, I'm taking a team at No. 1 with the preseason national player of the year; a team that brought in one of the best transfer classes of the offseason; a team that is adding multiple five-star freshman; and a team that had the No. 2-ranked offense last season en route to the Final Four. Alabama. The Tide are in the rare spot of having the men's basketball band ranked higher in the preseason than the football fellas, just the eighth time that's happened and the first time since 2006. (Bama football was No. 5 in the preseason.) Alabama, of course, is coming off its first Final Four in school history. Now it's going to try to become just the fourth SEC school (joining Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky) to make back-to-back Final Fours. Remember, the Tide was wicked unpredictable on defense last season, but survived in the NCAAs despite that, beating trendy Charleston and 30-win Grand Canyon before upsetting No. 1 UNC and then pushing past Clemson in the Elite Eight. Ultimately, Alabama lost by 14 to UConn in the national semis, which was the Huskies' smallest margin of victory in the NCAAs. Nate Oats did this after losing his entire staff the previous offseason, in addition to the Brandon Miller debacle. Now he's got one of the strongest rosters in the sport, led by CBS Sports Preseason Player of the Year Mark Sears. The inventive lead guard averaged 21.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.0 assists. Returning with Sears are two more fifth-year guys: Grant Nelson (11.9 ppg) and Latrell Wrightsell Jr. (8.9 ppg), in addition to promising 6-11 sophomore Jarin Stevenson. Oats picked up notable transfers Chris Youngblood (15.3 ppg at South Florida), Houston Mallette (14.7 ppg at Pepperdine), Clifford Omoruyi (10.4 ppg at Rutgers) and a quisling in former Auburn guard Aden Holloway (7.3 ppg). Oh, and there's also two five-star freshmen in play: power forward Derrion Reid and center Aiden Sherrell. Bama has a loaded nonconference schedule (it plays Purdue, UNC and Houston, all top seeds last March, plus Illinois, Rutgers and Creighton, in addition to hosting a lot of really good mid-majors; it only has six non-con home games, the lowest of any high-major team in the country), so there's a chance the Tide accrues some losses that affect their standing in the human rankings. But I'm expecting this team to be a No. 1 seed and a clear title contender from Game 1. If Sears plays to expectations and the offense remains elite, this will be the best Alabama team in school history. A program that has finished No. 2 at KenPom.com three years running, so let's slot it right there again. Houston's averaged a nation-leading 30.2 wins the past six seasons, amassing 13 NCAA Tournament victories in that span. It hasn't lost more than five league games in a season in that span, including postseason play. The Cougars moved from the American to the Big 12 last season, and not only was there no drop-off whatsoever, the team seemed emboldened by its conference upgrade. A year ago, UH lost a First Team All-American (Marcus Sasser), only to produce another: Jamal Shead. Now Shead is gone (and had he not ripped up his ankle against Duke in the NCAAs, it's all too conceivable Houston would've been at the Final Four in place of NC State). The Cougars' next player in line for All-American status is senior L.J. Cryer, who averaged 15.5 points last season and should show his best yet. The Coogs also bring back proven players Emanuel Sharp (12.6 ppg), J'Wan Roberts (9.5 ppg), Ja'Vier Francis (6.0 ppg) and Joseph Tugler — a key defensive presence whose season ended in February. There's also Terrance Arceneaux, also coming back from injury and whose time surely must be coming. Milos Uzan, via Oklahoma, will be productive in a supporting role that won't require him to be an alpha. Kelvin Sampson's a proven commodity in college hoops. The Big 12 might be the best conference in the sport again, and while Kansas is rightfully getting a lot of No. 1 buzz heading into the season, I'll slightly side in that league with the program whose defense has been more reliable in the past half-decade than any other in college basketball. We're going to see a lot of good three-man cores this season, but Kansas could have the best in the sport: Hunter Dickinson, KJ Adams Jr. and Dajuan Harris Jr. They're all back and each does a variety of things different from the other two that will, again, make Kansas a national title threat. KU was supposed to be that a season ago, but the Jayhawks faced injury issues and withered down the stretch, finishing 27th at KenPom, its all-time low-water mark in that metric's 28-year database. The Jayhawks have reinforcements coming in, and the outlook is optimistic because AJ Storr (Wisconsin), Rylan Griffen (Alabama) and Zeke Mayo (South Dakota State) are all proven scorers AND shooters. Griffen could be near the top of the list of best 3-point snipers if his trajectory translates. KU also has top-20 prospect Flory Bidunga, a center, and four-star guard Rakease Passmore coming in. No Elmarko Jackson, though; he's out for the season with patellar tendon injury he suffered in June. The Jayhawks' biggest problem last season was depth. At one point, Self told me, he seriously debated whether or not to play his five best players together for about 36 out of 40 minutes in a game — and hockey-sub five bench players and try to survive that way. He never did it, but it would have been a fascinating approach. This team, knock on wood, will not need to be kept together with lattice. Dickinson is a preseason First Team All-American in this, his final season of college eligibility. Everything is in place for another great run in Lawrence. Most others in this scenario wouldn't sniff the top 10, solely because of the amount of unproven players that are going to step into new roles and more prominent tasks in Storrs. But UConn is different. Dan Hurley is even more different than different. I've got the Huskies at No. 4 because the program kept Hurley and won the angsty sweepstakes against the Lakers. The coaching staff is still entirely intact, too. And Alex Karaban, a two-time national champion as a starter on both teams, turned down the NBA for one more year in order to chase NCAA history. That's enough to give the Huskies the benefit of the doubt and place them this high heading into the season. Connecticut lost four starters (Tristen Newton, Donovan Clingan, Cam Spencer, Stephon Castle) who'll likely be replaced in the starting lineup by Hassan Diarra, Samson Johnson, Solo Ball and Liam McNeeley. The first three are returnees and McNeeley earned CBS Sports Freshman All-America honors. One guy who's probably going to earn a fair share of starts is Jaylin Stewart. Connecticut also picked up lead guard Aidan Mahaney from Saint Mary's. The two most recent back-to-back champions were Florida in 2007 and Duke in 1992. In the subsequent seasons, Florida went 24-12, made the NIT and was 8-9 vs. SEC opponents. It never reached No. 1 in the AP poll in 2007-08. The 1992-93 Duke team finished 24-8 and went 10-7 vs. ACC opponents. It lost to Cal in the second round of the NCAAs. The Devils spent five weeks at No. 1. Relatedly, we polled 100-plus coaches this summer and asked if they thought UConn would make a third straight Final Four: 68% said no. But the fact 32% said yes is incredible. Hurley is the face of college basketball and one of the most prominent coaches in American sports. He is operating at the peak of his powers, and knowing him, he's obsessed with proving people wrong and is probably sounding klaxons over being put fourth on this list. It will be absurdly difficult to win three national titles in a row. I can't wait to see this version of UConn and how the story plays out over the next five months. Another year, another loaded Duke roster? Yes, but this one includes the most hyped incoming prospect in a generation. Although Zion Williamson became a transcendent sensation, he wasn't expected to be a First Team All-American when he started at Duke; he wasn't even the highest-rated prospect on the team. (RJ Barrett AND Cam Reddish were both ranked above Williamson in 2018.) Now, Cooper Flagg, the CBS Sports Preseason Freshman of the Year, represents Duke's chance to recapture the nation's attention. He could be the best player in the sport … but he's also got a lot around him that may lead to a different reality. Flagg's certainly regarded as the top NBA Draft prospect heading into November. Fortunately, he'll have veterans to acclimate him, most notably junior point guard Tyrese Proctor, sophomore guard Caleb Foster and grad senior Mason Gillis, who comes by way of Purdue, bringing a lot of winning experience with him from West Lafayette, Indiana. Jon Scheyer enters Year 3. The pressure will be significant. He's done a really good job through the first two campaigns, but these next five-to-six months seem destined to feel a lot different. Expectations will be to win the ACC, then get a top-two seed in the NCAAs and to make the Final Four after coming one game short last spring. Proctor has to be more consistent. Flagg's fellow freshmen are all ranked top-30: Isaiah Evans, a lanky 6-foot-7 wing; Khaman Maluach, a 7-1 center from South Sudan who played in the Olympics; Kon Knueppel, a 6-5 shooting guard who might be the skeleton key for this offense; Pat Ngongba (currently dealing with a foot injury), a 6-10 power forward (the idea that he could be the eighth- or ninth-most important player on this team speaks to how loaded Duke is); and Darren Harris, a 6-4 shooting guard who most fan bases would be doing cartwheels over if he was on their roster. Scheyer also has Tulane transfer Sion James (14.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 38% from 3-point range), who will get a lot of run. Can Duke win big despite having so much youth, and how much youth will they rely on? The Blue Devils will be a national story every week, and whether you like, love or hate them, that's a good thing for college basketball. For the third straight year, I'm higher on the Bears than just about anyone you'll find. It's working out for me: BU has had a No. 1- or No. 3-seeded résumé the past five years (counting 2020 when that season ended). Scott Drew lost a LOT from last season, and he's also had some coaching turnover on his staff, but until I see true drop-off in Waco I'm not bailing on Baylor as a top-10 program. This year, I've slotted the Bears second in the Big 12 and easily in the Final-Four-contenders discussion. Drew will have to account for losing another lottery pick one-and-done guy (Ja'Kobe Walter) by ... bringing in another lottery pick one-and-done guy (VJ Edgecombe). There is a workable chance Edgecombe winds up leading all freshmen in scoring. He's receiving buzz already for how dynamic his game is. Real star potential. Whether he should or will be tasked with being Baylor's leader is another matter. Langston Love (11.0 ppg) and Jayden Nunn (10.5 ppg) are the two prominent guys back for the Bears. They'll play with Duke transfer Jeremy Roach in the backcourt. Roach has said he wants to be a pure point guard in this Baylor scheme. If that happens and he's an elite decision-maker, then Baylor will be a top-10 team. The Bears also got a crucial transfer in fifth-year player Norchad Omier, who flew up from Miami. Baylor's varying looks will be interesting. I expect a lot of small-ball with Omier at the 5, flanked by Edgecombe at the 4, Langston at 3, Nunn at the 2 and Roach playing the 1. If Omier plays power forward, then junior Josh Ojianwuna will step in at center. Robert Wright III and Jason Asemota are two more fresh bodies (and freshmen) who will see some time. Be patient with the Bears. No high-major team has a tougher first two games. They're playing Gonzaga in GU's backyard on opening night, then facing Arkansas in Dallas five days later. St. John's, UConn and Tennessee (potentially) are also on the schedule. Then it's Big 12 time. Similar to Alabama, this team could be better than its loss total indicates. Lose the best player in school history and stay a top-10 team? That's what great culture and elite coaching will do for you. That's what Purdue has. The only school to win more games over the past three years than Purdue is the one I have ranked at No. 2. The Big Ten — now a ridiculous, nobody-asked-for-this 18-school union — feels as hodgepodge as ever. But I'll take the Boilermakers to emerge at the top again. Three starters are back, the most important being Braden Smith, who could become a top-three point guard if this offense regenerates properly, Doctor Who-style, without Zach Edey. Purdue, in total, has 46% of its scoring back from last season's team that made it to the national championship. Look for Trey Kaufman-Renn to be THE breakout player in the Big Ten. In two seasons he's averaged 4.5 and 6.4 points. That number should double, minimally. Caleb Furst is also likely to bust from his shell. But this is Purdue, so let's talk centers. Who are the new towers in play? There's Daniel Jacobsen (7-4) and Will Berg (7-2). The Jesse Pinkman memes about Painter continually recruiting alien-sized players will continue apace once the games get going. Purdue has rostered a 7-footer 13 years in a row which, for all we know, is an all-time NCAA record. (If you know of a school that's had a 7-footer for 14 straight seasons, please find me.) Here's an intriguing note from Purdue: The team brings back 60% of its starting minutes from a season ago. Why does that matter? This is the 11th time under Painter that Purdue has brought back that much year-over-year. The eight most recent times Purdue brought back "at least 110 starts" from the year before, Purdue made the Sweet 16 in six of those seasons. Its winning percentage in those eight seasons: .789. That's really, really good. And given the growth of Smith and Fletcher Loyer, it should signal stability in the foggiest power conference in college basketball. Purdue has 113 league wins the past eight seasons. No high-major team claims more. Its Big Ten reign will continue by winning a fifth conference title in a nine-year span. The Volunteers had the second-best player in college basketball last season. Dalton Knecht will go down as one of the best up-transfers in college hoops history. From Northern Colorado to SEC POY. And Tennessee made a fun run to the Elite Eight before losing to the best player in college basketball. Rick Barnes not only lost Knecht, but also Jonas Aidoo, Josiah-Jordan James, Santiago Vescovi and Tobe Awaka. It's a lot! Maybe Tennessee suffers a plummet and proves to be, like, the eighth-best team in the SEC. But I'm gonna zag on that theory. I'll stick with the Barnes formula and register UT as the No. 2 team in the league. Critically, Zakai Zeigler's leadership at point guard is still in play in Knoxville. Zeigler can be a top-20 player nationally, buttressed by the fact that he's probably a top-10 defensive guard (at 5-8, no less). Zeigler's going to be at his best physically this season, and he'll pair in the backcourt with a North Florida transfer who hopes to be the next Knecht. His name is Chaz Lanier and he shot 44% from 3-point range last season while averaging 19.7 points. I like him to easily average double digits in the SEC. Barnes also brought on Felix Okpara from Ohio State, a quick-twitch center who could threaten to average three blocks and is a major reason why Tennessee will still be regarded as an SEC contender. I like sophomore J.P. Estrella to have a breakout season. Unclear whether he'll start in November, but I wouldn't be surprised in the least if he was hearing his name called in pregame by February. Due to the SEC's depth, accurately predicting even the 1-5 order of this league will be near-impossible. But until I see Tennessee significantly drop under Barnes, the Vols (as a regular-season operation) deserve the benefit of every doubt. Mark Few is feeling revitalized. He's coming off his time with Team USA at the Olympics, where he served as an assistant on the gold-medal winning team. It'd be no shock if Few picked up a few extra tricks from Steve Kerr and deployed some fun stuff in his offense in the months forthcoming. The Bulldogs are dinged slightly by the unfortunate loss — for the second year in a row — of small forward Steele Venters. The Eastern Washington transfer suffered an Achilles tear less than a year after rupturing an ACL. He figured to be a double-digit scorer. This being Gonzaga, I still think the Bulldogs find a way to have one of the best offenses in the sport for the ninth straight season. Graham Ike (16.5 ppg) will probably have the best season of his career; the timing is great considering this is his last one. Same goes for Ryan Nembhard, a fringe preseason All-America candidate who could threaten to average 15 points and 7 assists. Gonzaga has 81.4% of its minutes back from 2023-24, seventh-most in the country, according to BartTorvik.com. The only high-major program bringing back more is Notre Dame, per Torvik, and the only other two in the top 25 in terms of power-conference programs are Houston and Marquette. In bringing back more than 80% of the team's minutes, continuity should provide an easy transition and a likely 18th straight season with 25-plus wins. Guys like Nolan Hickman, Ben Gregg and Dusty Stromer should all play increased roles, while Pepperdine transfer Michael Ajayi (absolute hooper) and Arkansas import Khalif Battle (on his fourth school in four years, no less) reinforce GU's firepower and experience factor. The question is: Have we seen Gonzaga at its best, or does Few have another Final Four-level team in him? This one seems to have a shot. Fortunately, we don't have to wait to see the goods. The Zags play Baylor on opening night, thankfully giving college hoops a true marquee matchup to tip off the season. There's split opinion on how viable North Carolina is after losing one of the most productive players in school history, Armando Bacot, in addition to saying goodbye to double-digit scorers Harrison Ingram and Cormac Ryan. The most important player was RJ Davis, and lucky for UNC, the First Team All-American is using his COVID year for one last dance. Asking Davis (21.2 ppg) to recreate his impact from his senior season will be tough, but he might not have to in order to keep North Carolina in the top two in the ACC. Davis has company in the backcourt with familiar teammates Elliot Cadeau (expect a much better player this season), Seth Trimble and Jae'Lyn Withers coming back to Chapel Hill. Belmont transfer Cade Tyson (16.2 ppg) brings shooting reinforcements, while Vanderbilt big Ven-Allen Lubin is going to play with Jalen Washington to hopefully keep UNC's frontcourt somewhat respectable. UNC's lack of interior presence is the elephant in the room when we discuss the Heels' chances of being a national title contender. Ironically, I'm in on Carolina as a top-10 team because of its top two freshmen. It's counterintuitive in this final year of the bonus COVID year to think that 18-year-olds could be linchpin-type players, but that is setting up as the case here. Ian Jackson was ranked No. 8 in his class. The 6-5 2-guard from the Bronx could be a streaky shooter, but he's going to be a lot of fun as a potential sometimes-starter. Drake Powell (No. 11 in the class of 2024) is a guy I can't wait to watch. Powell's a strong wing, someone who could prove to be a high-level defender right away. It wouldn't surprise me if those two wound up being top-10 freshmen. UNC fell short of a second Final Four in three years under Hubert Davis, despite being a No. 1 seed, thanks to slamming into high-octane Alabama. Asking this group to build top-20 formats in offensive and defensive efficiency (which seems plausible as far as I'm concerned) should equate to Carolina again being in the Final Four mix. Things get going early: Nov. 8 at Kansas is a wonderful matchup in the first week of the season. Then UNC will test itself in Maui in that loaded field before eventually facing the likes of Alabama, Florida and UCLA in December. This team is going to take losses but will solidify itself to tussle with Duke atop the ACC. Let's just buy the ticket and take the ride. This is admittedly an aggressive spot for the Johnnies, who are coming off the shocking non-inclusion to the NCAAs. Not just that — St. John's wasn't even in the first four out after giving UConn its closest game in all of March and April. The Red Storm went 20-13 with a 4-10 record in Quad 1 and 3-1 in Quad 3. It wasn't enough. Now it needs to be better than an 11-9 team in the Big East that's sitting in fifth. I think it clears that bar with ease in '24-25. Rick Pitino is going to be a mad scientist making sure this team is nowhere near the bubble, despite the departures of Daniss Jenkins, Joel Soriano, Jordan Dingle, Chris Leldum and Nahiem Alleyne. They merely combined to average more than 57 points per game no biggie. My favorite conspiracy theory is Pitino went to Kentucky's Big Blue Madness and donned a UK sweater, whipping up multiple fan bases into a tizzy, knowing all the while he's got a team that's going to kill it this season. So, who's stepping up? RJ Luis (10.9 ppg) is the most important returnee, though I'd bank on Simeon Wilcher (2.8 ppg) quadrupling his scoring output in his sophomore season. He was a good team player, but now it's time to embrace a much more prominent role. Not as prominent as Kadary Richmond, who crossed enemy lines and made the switch from Seton Hall to SJU. Richmond will be on the short list of preseason Big East player of the year honors after averaging nearly 16 points at the Hall and scoring more than 1,200 points in his career. I think he's a dark horse choice for NPOY, too. Richmond will be set up by a great portal get in Deivon Smith, who averaged 13.3 points, 7.1 assists and 6.3 rebounds at Utah. Just a huge add there. Another key name is Vincent Iwuchukwu, who could benefit from a change in scenery after giving it an honest go the past two seasons at USC, following his heart scare in the summer of 2022. Look for Iwuchukwu to back up Zuby Ejiofor at the 5 and for North Texas 4-man Aaron Scott to be the first player off the bench. I love the talent blend and obviously trust the coaching. This could be UConn's biggest challenger in the Big East, and after last March's fireworks at MSG, who doesn't want to see more of that? Longtime readers know (and love?) my penchant for taking a few big swings every year in my top 25. Similar to St. John's, I am all the way in on Wake Forest: Top 15 Team. I'm just as in on the idea that lead guard Hunter Sallis will become a First Team All-American after bypassing the NBA Draft. Sallis averaged 18.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists and shot 40.5% from 3 last season. He's the latest transfer to downright thrive in Steve Forbes' system. Did Forbes land his transfers based on his reputation for being a portal whisperer? "Oh, without question — because they were offered way more money by other people," Forbes told me last season. "You have to have some (NIL), you can't just come in here empty handed. But, Hunter made a business decision. He did his homework." Sallis' jolt of confidence has Wake Forest's fanbase feeling more beatific heading into a November than it's been in a decade-plus. Sallis is super-receptive to coaching, has an insatiable work ethic and everyone in the program follows his lead. This year, Sallis carries Wake into the upper echelon of the ACC and gets the Deacs to the NCAAs, snapping the school's eight-year drought. He returns alongside another key Deacon, Efton Reid. If Reid can avoid foul trouble, he could emerge as one of the best bigs in the conference. Cameron Hildreth is also back in the starting lineup, effectively playing a third guard. The point? That will be Ty-Laur Johnson (Louisville), but given this is Wake, new bodies abound. App State transfer Tre'Von Spillers will play the 4, while Omaha Biliew (Iowa State) and Davin Cosby (Alabama) will also be getting plenty of run in their new surroundings. When Wake Forest is wrecking teams, remember who was first aboard the ship. Like pretty much every Marquette fan, I'm a convert to the notion that Shaka Smart is in the perfect place for what he wants to achieve in his career. The Golden Eagles are averaging 25 wins per season through Smart's first three years. I think they hit that number in Year 4 … but I also must draw attention to the reality that this will be Smart's first season at MU without Tyler Kolek in the locker room. His leadership and presence helped cement the foundation for Smart's vision of a reborn Marquette program. Now Kolek's off in the NBA and soon to be playing in a building he once won a championship in: Madison Square Garden. The Golden Eagles should still be one of the Big East's best because they do in fact return their leading scorer. Kam Jones and his 17.2 points per game are still here, flanked in the backcourt by Stevie Mitchell and Chase Ross. Underestimate that troika at your own peril. Forward David Joplin is also back, and yeah this is the place where I remind you that Smart opted not to bring in a transfer yet again. He's making it work. Against the rip tides of the sport, Smart is pulling this off. (Big man Ben Gold is about to have a breakout season as well, you can practically smell it.) If this prediction proves correct and Marquette winds up with a No. 4 seed or better for the third straight season, Smart's going to be able to charge outrageous public appearance rates to speak at coaching clinics across the country. They've got something really strong going, and with nearly 73% of the team's minutes still here from a season ago, it's more than fair to give this lot the benefit of the doubt following two seasons in which they finished 13th and 10th at KenPom. After three seasons and 88 wins in the Pac-12, Tommy Lloyd now takes his high-octane offense into the Big 12. The Wildcats figure to be one of the five best teams in that outstanding conference — something reflected in the preseason AP Top 25, where Arizona ranked fifth among Big 12 teams but was still ranked 10th. (Damn.) It's practically unheard of to have five returning All-Americans in college basketball in this generation, but that's what we're getting. One of those five is the final Pac-12 (As We Knew It) Player of the Year: Caleb Love. He's back for one more season, which means Arizona will be irresistible to watch. Love had some really good moments last season, in addition to the expected dose of Anything Could Happen On This Possession (Watch Out!). Also returning: Jaden Bradley (love his defense; crazy underrated player) and KJ Lewis (big breakout potential as a sophomore). Those three will be Arizona's backcourt, and they'll start alongside 7-2 sophomore Motiejus Krivas and Horizon League POY Trey Townsend, who helped Oakland to that charmed Cinderella run. Lloyd should get some frontcourt insurance from Tobe Awaka, who arrives after playing for Tennessee. Reports out of Tucson also indicate Anthony Dell'orso and Henri Veesaar have been absolute studs, with freshman Carter Bryant exceeding expectations, too. It will be enticing to see how this team adapts to the Big 12. Is Arizona going to come in and be as good in its first year the way Houston was last season? That wouldn't be a shock, but I'm going to stop short of that. I like a team in the 3-5 seed range that yet again will rank near the top of the most watchable offenses in choops. This is going to feel refreshing for everyone. John Calipari's time at UK needed to end. He did a lot of great things there, but the program was aching for a reboot. In comes affable alum Mark Pope, and what a flip this has been. Big Blue Nation went from despondent to delirious over the course of 48 hours after his hiring became public, a fan reaction reversion the likes of which I can't ever recall. So, how will the Wildcats look under new management? Pope has seemingly assembled a 10-deep roster without holding on to a single player who was in uniform in Lexington last season. My best guess at the opening day starting five: Kerr Kriisa (WVU transfer), Lamont Butler (SDSU transfer), Andrew Carr (Wake Forest transfer), Jaxson Robinson (BYU transfer) and Amari Williams (Drexel transfer). Those five combined to average 60 points last season. First off the bench figures to be 3-point specialist Koby Brea, who might even play his way into the starting role. Brea's commitment to UK solidified this roster's validity as top 25-quality. Pope also has Ansley Almonor (16.4 ppg at Fairleigh Dickinson), Otega Oweh (11.4 ppg at Oklahoma) and Brandon Garrison (7.5 ppg at Oklahoma State), with Garrison's long-term potential being a building block for the Pope era. Freshmen Collin Chandler, Travis Perry and Trent Noah will give the UK staff a deployment that's deeper than just about any roster Calipari had at Kentucky. (Notice I didn't write "more talented.") With games against Duke, Gonzaga, at Clemson and vs. Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic, the Wildcats will be tested regularly. I can't wait to see how this behemoth of a program is reborn with a vastly different personality calling the shots. I got to spend an afternoon this spring at UCLA, and one of the big takeaways for the year ahead was how connected and mature the group was in Westwood. Mick Cronin needed this, you'll recall, because he was as vocally critical of his team as any coach last season. (To the point where some in college basketball wondered if he was looking for a way out. UCLA went 16-17 and was a huge letdown. Cronin had never been so out of answers.) Turns out, things weren't so bad as to have a roster revolt. Three players that combined to average 37 points last season are back: point guard Dylan Andrews, shooting guard Sebastian Mack and small forward Lazar Stefanovic. UCLA is also bringing back the 7-3 Aday Mara who, with Zach Edey gone, will be among the tallest players in the sport. There's more, of course. UCLA actually had NIL resources during this past cycle, so expect Cronin to go 10-deep thanks to bringing on five transfers that averaged double-digit scoring, led by Tyler Bilodeau (14.3 ppg at Oregon State) and Dominick Harris (14.3 ppg at Loyola Marymount). From 2020-23, Cronin had offenses that ranked 11th, 12th and 21st in efficiency at KenPom. Last season it cratered to 152. I'd be shocked if this group didn't at least get into the top 40 and with a team that is more 3-point reliant than any of Cronin's previous squads at UCLA. There might be some small sacrifice on the defensive end (which Cronin will understandably resist), but it's a worthwhile trade-off to get UCLA back into the top-25 conversation. I'm bullish on the Bruins in their first year in the Big Ten. The Bluejays clear a preseason top-20 designation thanks to getting resolute big man Ryan Kalkbrenner back for a fifth and final season. Kalkbrenner is the early automatic frontrunner for Big East defensive player of the year, which doubles in selling him as a top-five defender in the sport. (He's won DPOY in the Big East three years running and will tie Patrick Ewing's mark of four in a row if he does it again.) Big Kalk averaged 17.3 points, 7.6 rebounds and 3.1 blocks for a borderline top-10 team. It won't be easy, but mark me down for it: He betters all of those numbers in '24-25. Fortunately, Kalk is back with Mason Miller and Steven Ashworth also returning to the fold. That's critical in Creighton's quest to capture top-three status in the Big East for a sixth time in a seven-year stretch. It won't be easy due to the losses of Baylor Scheierman and Trey Alexander, both of whom are now in the NBA. And I wonder about CU's depth. The big portal get was Pop Isaacs, who averaged 15.8 points in a clattering season at Texas Tech. Isaac Traudt should be a growth prospect as a movable 4-man in Greg McDermott's system. Every year we get a handful of teams that are capable of only playing seven guys yet maintain nationally ranked status. I think the Jays are going to clear that bar, extending one more year in what's unequivocally been the best stretch of success in program history. Switching from Juwan Howard to Dusty May is going to be a near-180 culture overturn in Ann Arbor. Howard ultimately closed himself off to too many people and became too stubborn in trying to run a program. It redounded negatively on him to the point where AD Warde Manuel was effectively forced to go back on his word and fired Howard in March. In comes May, who won 126 games and averaged 21 wins in his six seasons at Florida Atlantic, which is outstanding considering the embarrassing lack of history and resources he embraced when he got that job in 2018. Michigan won out over Louisville and Vanderbilt for May's services, and I'm ranking U-M higher than just about anyone because the transfer haul feels like an ideal combo of size, shooting, speed, athleticism and proven commodities. Only one player followed May from FAU: center Vlad Goldin. He'll play alongside Yale transfer Danny Wolf, who could wind up as one of the five best up-transfers in college hoops … if Goldin doesn't rank ahead of him. Wolf can play the 3, 4 or 5 and is an A-level passer, screen-setter and space eater on the interior. Michigan also landed the underrated Sam Walters from Alabama, entering-his-prime Roddy Gayle Jr. from Ohio State, two-way competitor Rubin Jones from North Texas and sneaky-good 3-point contributor Tre Donaldson from Auburn. EvanMiya.com ranks Michigan's transfer class No. 5, which I might argue is too low. Scottie Pippen's son Justin is a freshman on this team, and the return of shooting guard Nimari Burnett and combo forward Will Tschetter should give May what he had at FAU: a roster that reliably is 10-deep and full of basketball-obsessed team players. I'm always good (or bad) for a smattering of zesty prognostications, so here's another. Boise State winning the Mountain West and becoming a top-20 crew feels as thrilling of a preseason call as almost any I've got listed. Leon Rice is over the moon at having a point guard who's his ideal kind of floor general. His name is Alvaro Cardenas. He was an intra-conference foil for Rice; Cardenas played for Tim Miles at San Jose State and averaged 13.2 points, 5.5 assists and shot 39% from 3-point territory. And he should be the key to unlock Boise State's latest NCAA Tournament team — and its first NCAA Tournament win in school history? We'll see. No program has made more Big Dances without a victory than the Broncos (0-10). BSU's best player is Tyson Degenhart. One of many instances where a high-major player is playing for a team outside the power-conference structure. Degenhart, a 6-8 senior, is the most practical preseason pick for MW POY. He might average 20/night on his way to becoming an NBA pick in 2025. Degenhart will again suit up alongside O'Mar Stanley, an undersized 5 who nevertheless played his way onto the all-league second team last season. On first glance, Boise State's roster doesn't shout "best in the Mountain West," but the buy-in at point guard and the physicality and versatility in the frontcourt has me believing in the Broncos. How big of a step back was last season? Consider that Indiana State finished 38th at KenPom, while IU was all the way at 91 and well out of the NCAA Tournament conversation. Despite making the Big Dance in years 1 and 2, Mike Woodson enters Year 4 on uneasy ground after the frustrations that sprouted like weeds emerged a season ago. The Hoosiers shouldn't even entertain outcomes that threaten Woodson's job security, though, not with the roster he's put together. IU brings back a 15-point-per-game guy in Malik Reneau (15.4 ppg), a 10.6 point-per-game vet in Trey Galloway, plus a likely sophomore burst from Mackenzie Mgbako (12.2 ppg). The Hoosiers, operating with a healthy NIL budget, also recruited Oumar Ballo from Arizona and Myles Rice from Washington State (two top-100 players), in addition to some others, like Kanaan Carlyle, who I'm eager to see in new surroundings after a nondescript season at Stanford. The 3-point shooting (or lack thereof) is a glaring concern, but most everything else screams top-20 roster. Can IU do it? Can it finish as a top-25 team for the first time in almost a decade? I can't shake the feeling this is going to be a noisy season (and that can be a good thing in many respects) for Woodson's program. One major letdown is the nonconference schedule, which is sorely lacking in must-see matchups. It also will give Indiana a lot less slack come conference play if IU falls short of winning the Battle 4 Atlantis. The Cyclones were unquestionably a top-10 team last season. The defense rated No. 1 at KenPom. The Clones destroyed inferior opponents on the regular and deserved a top seed instead of the No. 2 they got on Selection Sunday. That said, as I do every year (to varying results, yes!), I have to fade some teams in order to heavily buy in on some others in against-the-grain fashion. Mark me down for having ISU scootch back a bit in the bloated, beastly Big 12. The starting five will be led by one of the best guards in the country, Tamin Lipsey, who should be much more respected and discussed — to the level he deserves — by the time we get to Christmas. Lipsey will be flanked in the backcourt by senior Keshon Gilbert, who led the team in usage last season and probably will again this year. T.J. Otzelberger also brings back one of the more promising sophomores in the Big 12, Milan Momcilovic, who will play the 3. In the frontcourt, Saint Mary's transfer Joshua Jefferson and Charlotte newcomer Dishon Jackson will likely be starters. I'm wondering about the reliability up front, which is why I've opted to slightly sell on ISU's outlook. Overall, there's little question about this team's NCAA chances and its defensive pedigree. They can win ugly, but few care about style when the Ws rack up. This school should be dancing for the fourth straight year which would mark only the second time in program history that's happened. 10, 23, 14, 4, 8, 6, 6, 20. That's the final KenPom ranking for the No. 2 Big Ten over the past eight seasons. Illinois might be No. 2 this season, but it has been No. 2 (and sometimes No. 1) in the Big Ten over the past five seasons. Brad Underwood has a program humming, and that's a fact because he's made a habit of losing all-league guys and not falling too far behind. He'll carry on without Terrence Shannon Jr., Coleman Hawkins, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, Dain Dainja and Luke Goode. That's tons to overcome, but I have faith he'll do it thanks to some stars in the making that should find new life in Champaign. It will start with a guy I've been told has been insanely good in practice: freshman lead guard Kasparas Jakucionis. The Lithuanian could be a 2025 lottery pick. He'll join forces with Kylan Boswell, who averaged 9.6 points and 3.6 assists in a hot-and-cold two-year run with Arizona. Those two are the key, and they'll have help from Ty Rodgers and Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn, both of whom need to emerge as more consistent contributors. Carey Booth is a fledgling talent who couldn't get it going at Notre Dame. I like his chances to be a solid piece off the bench. Underwood also will bank on Ben Humrichous (14.7 ppg at Evansville) and Tre White (12.3 with Louisville) being minutes-eaters alongside two top-30 freshmen in 3-man Will Riley and 5 Morez Johnson. Illinois can be both the surprise and the reliable, pragmatic choice as a top-four finisher in the Big Ten. The tempting sleeper in the SEC. Todd Golden's Gators return three players (Walter Clayton Jr. and Will Richard in the backcourt, Alex Condon as a big) who averaged 20-plus minutes last season. They'll all be starters alongside transfers Alijah Martin (FAU) and, most likely, Rueben Chinyelu (Washington State). Martin committing to UF was a big-time add; he's an opportunistic scorer and is going to be one of the best man-to-man defenders in the SEC. With his Final Four pedigree, Martin figures to rise Florida's floor. Sophomore forward Thomas Haugh has also made huge strides in the offseason and will be the sixth man at worst. Clayton's savvy playmaking ability will likely lead to him being a top-four lead guard in the SEC. He's high-IQ, no doubt, and now the goal is to perk his 3-point accuracy from 36% and change to that ever-coveted 40% threshold. The Gators haven't yet returned to that upper-echelon SEC program that they could claim for a good portion of Billy Donovan's time, but Golden has the temperament and intellect to get there. Surprising though it may seem, Kansas State is now one of the biggest players in the transfer market. That was proven when Jerome Tang's program landed what's acknowledged as the most expensive portal get of 2024: Coleman Hawkins. The price? North of $2 million. The longtime Illinois stretch 4 will need to be one of the 20-or-so best players in American to both validate his NIL tag and lift K-State to top-25 status. I believe he will, and that's why I have the Wildcats ranked accordingly. Tang also brought on Achor Achor from Samford, Dug McDaniel from Michigan, Ugonna Onyenso from Kentucky and Max Jones from Cal State Fullerton, where he quietly/reliably averaged 15.3 points. Villanova transfer Brendan Hausen also will play north of 20 minutes per night. It's a big roster changeover, one of the starkest of any Power Five program that didn't undergo a coaching flip in '24. Tang was heavily courted by Arkansas but turned down the Razorbacks. He's where he wants to be and no question has the talent to get back to the Big Dance after missing out last year. Who amongst us can't wait to see John Calipari's final phase in Fayetteville? The Razorbacks' new coach returns just one player from the Eric Musselman regime, but he's a key one: Trevon Brazile. The stretchy 4-man opted to stick around for a rebuild that has some attention-grabbing parts. DJ Wagner followed Calipari from Kentucky, as did Adou Thiero and Zvonimir Ivišić. The latter two will be complementary pieces who could shine from time to time, but it's Wagner that seems to be the key. He took a backseat last season, despite starting, because of the dazzling play from Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham. Those two are now in the NBA. Wagner hopes to be there a year from now, but the thing is, his style is close to Johnell Davis, who was an 18.2 ppg guy at FAU last season and is also on the Hogs' roster. That duo needs to learn to play off each other to give Arkansas a shot at landing in the top four of the SEC. And that's before taking into account that freshman Boogie Fland is also going to want the ball in his hands. Fland arrives alongside Karter Knox and Billy Richmond, all three switching allegiances from Kentucky shortly after Calipari fled for Hog heaven. Defensively, the Razorbacks will be viable for one man above all others: Jonas Aidoo. The Tennessee transfer averaged 11.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and was subsequently feverishly recruited in the portal. The class ranked No. 6 in the sport, per EvanMiya.com. To the shock of nobody, Calipari has recruited an enviable cluster of talent. He will have to embrace some late-career reinventions in order to dodge the flare-up of disappointments that became toxic in Lexington. Whether he's capable remains to be seen. But given who he convinced to follow him to Arkansas, this team has no excuse not to be one of the 30 best in college hoops. The last time MSU had a seed better than No. 7 was 2019 (though it would have been either a No. 2 or No. 3 in 2020). We're waiting on the return of vintage Michigan State. Will it happen in 2025? How many years does Tom Izzo still want to do this? Two more? Five? Whatever it is, I do expect Sparty to qualify for a 27th straight NCAA Tournament and for this team to be embedded in the strong and deep second tier in the Big Ten. A lot of pieces return from a 20-15 squad that ranked top-20 at KenPom. In fact, MSU is pretty well-stocked, considering Tyson Walker, Malik Hall, A.J. Hoggard and Mady Sissoko are all gone. Jeremy Fears, Jaden Akins (he's the key) and Tre Holloman all return and will combo for a three-headed backcourt that I'd like to see push the issue a lot more than last season's unhurried scheme. In the frontcourt, Coen Carr and Xavier Booker ready for their sophomore close-ups, and it sounds like Jaxon Kohler's role should spike. The roster looks like one breakout candidate after another. Plus, a family tree has been planted. Jase Richardson, a freshman, is the son of a guy who carries a pretty great legacy in East Lansing: Jason Richardson. Good group. Given it's Izzo, I openly admit to the very real possibility that I've under-ranked his group, I just want to see it come together before putting MSU into the top 25. The best news here is Johni Broome has a real chance to challenge a rival player on a rival team, Alabama's Mark Sears, for SEC Player of the Year. Broome averaged 16.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 2.2 apg, 2.2 bpg and was a 55% shooter for a 27-win Auburn team that finished (HELLO!) fourth at KenPom. Yes: fourth — despite losing to Yale in the first round — the best finish in school history, even if the Big Dance result didn't correlate. (Nugget: 2018 Virginia and 2016 Michigan State are the only other teams to ever lose in the first round and finish top-five at KenPom.) Now Bruce Pearl has a group with sites set again on winning the SEC, though as you can see I'm a seller on that idea. Every year there are a few teams ranked in the preseason that prove to be overshots, and I'll take a chance Auburn applies here. I already know the tut-tutting from Auburn fans is going to follow me well into the season. I've accepted it. For reasons hard to foresee, some teams just take steps back. Chad Baker-Mazara and Denver Jones return, and those two should be double-digit scorers alongside Broome. Furman's JP Pegues, who dropped 18.4 a night last season, will also squeeze in here as a viable option in Pearl's offense. The transfer class isn't great, though: EvanMiya ranks this class 70th in the country and second-worst in the SEC, a league so stacked that surprise results are unavoidable. And given how good Auburn's schedule is (Houston, the Maui Invitational, Duke, Ohio State, Purdue; it's loaded) in the noncon, it's going to take on some losses before what I think will be one of the toughest SEC slates in the conference. Sean Miller instantly steered Xavier back toward its typical realm of success in his first season (a No. 3 seed and a Sweet 16 run), but last year was a humbling downgrade. X went 16-18 and battled health issues en route to a forgettable campaign. For Year 3, the Musketeers have some dark-horse potential in the Big East, even despite the loss of starting center Lassina Traore, who is already done for the year with a knee injury. However, Zach Freemantle will be 24 years old and get a fully healthy final season, which should lead to him being among the best bigs in the Big East. Freemantle is, essentially, a returning starter. The only other player that's true of is Dayvion McKnight. The fifth-year senior averaged 12.4 points, 4.8 assists, 3.7 rebounds and shot 37.2% on his 3s. Because Xavier was a non-factor, McKnight was probably one of the most underrated players in the Big East. He'll shine. The Musketeers brought in Indiana State transfer Ryan Conwell, who could be Souley Boum-esque in terms of his impact. Excellent shot-taker who averaged nearly 17 points for a witty Sycamores squad last season. Toledo transfer Dante Maddox Jr. is also in line to start, given his numbers last season (15.6 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 40.2 3-pt%). Given Miller's coaching acumen and the fact there are 10 players on this roster who are juniors, seniors or fifth-year players, it would be a semi-stunner if X wasn't easily in the NCAAs. It's wild times at Memphis these days, which is to say: everything's normal. Penny Hardaway's program is under NCAA investigation again, it's unclear what said investigation will lead to, and it's undetermined if Hardaway's actually on the hot seat or not. He made unusual late-offseason staff changes. The Tigers missed the NCAAs in March. Fan engagement is spotty, due in part to school administrators passing on an opportunity to leave the American for the Pac-12. (For now?) This is not a well-run outfit at present. But what about the basketball players? With Houston out of the conference, Memphis is the king of the league and is my pick to be the AAC's best — despite losing five key pieces. Hardaway's most important add would seem to be Tyrese Hunter, the former Iowa State and Texas point guard who is a reliable jump shot and two inches away from being an NBA Draft pick. He's going to team up with Tulsa transfer and top-shelf scorer PJ Haggerty. The frontcourt will feature a familiar name: Moussa Cisse is boomeranging back to the Tigers for his final season; he's a great rim protector and should help with Memphis' signature defensive edge. Dain Dainja comes by way of Illinois. I think he's a great get. The champion of the American should be a top-30 team. Based on talent, Memphis is the logical pick. The Bearcats will break through in Year 4 of Wes Miller's regime and make the NCAAs, ending a drought that dates back to 2019. Miller's team finished 39th at KenPom last season; a noticeable bump up is in order yet again. UC fans' patience will be rewarded. Miller has the benefit of returning enough above-average pieces to be a feisty team in the thick Big 12. There is no outright star here, but then again, that's the Cincinnati way more often than not. Jizzle James' breakout sophomore season is an expectation; the physical combo guard needs to make a jump to justify this ranking. But bringing back Day Day Thomas and Dan Skillings Jr. in the backcourt is just as important for the objectives in Cincy. Their style contrasted against Aziz Bandaogo's standout defense — he will be featured in the middle — is going to give the Bearcats some matchup advantages. Bandaogo will be assisted by Simas Lukosius, who can roam on the wing as one of the more dependable 6-8 3-point shooters in the league. The intriguing name is Dillon Mitchell, who is using his last year of eligibility and figures to start at the 4. BYU was the surprise metrics darling in the Big 12 last season. I sense UC could be that team in '24-25. Some might have expected the Red Raiders to drift into obscurity after the short-lived, disastrous end to the Mark Adams era. Not at all. Grant McCasland was the right guy at the right time. TTU went 23-11 and got a 6-seed in 2024 — doing so with an offense-first philosophy. It should be in that ballpark again in 2025. Two critical transfers to know: PG Elijah Hawkins (Minnesota) and JT Toppin (New Mexico). Hawkins was one of the best pure distributors in college hoops as a Gopher. Toppin is a bouncy wing that does a little bit of everything and broke Lobo hearts when he left ABQ. Adding those two in with three guys back (Darrion Williams, Chance McMillian, Kerwin Walton) who combined to average 30-plus points gives the Red Raiders a sleeper's chance at being a Big 12 contender. Devan Cambridge is also back, and on his way to being healthy. A lot of promise with this team. The Wahoos have made all but two NCAA tourneys since 2012, and I'm confident that broad track of success continues in 2025. But it's time for UVa to get back to making its mark in March; the program's last Big Dance victory was against Texas Tech in the 2019 title game. Last season, Virginia was a no-show vs. Colorado State in the First Four. Losing Ryan Dunn and Reece Beekman early to the NBA (borderline priceless defenders) drops the Cavs' ceiling and essentially forces them out of top-25 consideration heading into November. Tony Bennett brings back shooting guard Isaac McKneely and his reassuring 44.5% 3-point accuracy. Big man Blake Buchanan is situated for a breakout year and he's not going to be the only one in Charlottesville. The portal add who could be requisite to Virginia finishing in the top five of the ACC is a guy who was in the league last season, but barely made a mark. TJ Power opted out of Duke, knowing full well just how much talent was coming in. At Virginia he can become one of the breakout sophomores, provided he's bought into Bennett's defensive requirements. Anthony Grant is 135-55 in his last six seasons at UD, equating to a magnificent .711 winning percentage, the best in the Atlantic 10 in that span and one of the 15 best of any men's Division I coach. It's for that reason, above all others, that I will again forecast Dayton as the best team in the conference. The Flyers are the most consistent team in that league. There are some lowered expectations because of the loss of DaRon Holmes II, but UD fans have seen their team overcome significant losses of NBA-level talent before. Thankfully, Malachi Smith's return from injury should inject renewed optimism in Dayton, going along with the return of preseason A-10 first-teamer Nate Santos. Santos, Enoch Cheeks and Javon Bennett are the support columns, but it's the transfers that make me all in on Dayton's return to the Big Dance. (UD is coming off an NCAA appearance as a No. 7 seed, which included a win over Nevada in the first round.) The Flyers brought in former Ohio State big man Zed Key and well-traveled defensive specialist Posh Alexander, who are both old enough to be voting in a second presidential election. How a coach schedules tells me how confident he is in his team. UD is not only going to Maui, but Grant also has Marquette, UNLV, Cincinnati and Northwestern on the schedule. These guys might not be as good as last season, but I think they'll be relatively close. What encore is in store for the team that made its first Elite Eight in 44 years? The Tigers have a healthy chance at a fifth NCAA Tournament push under Brad Brownell (and it would be the first time ever under him that Clemson made back-to-back Big Dances) with the return of Chase Hunter at combo guard and power forward Ian Schieffelin. Had PJ Hall come back, Clemson would have easily been a preseason AP Top 25 team. Without him, they'll look to make up some ground and can get their bona fides on defense with Cincinnati transfer Viktor Lakhin. The Tigers will rely on Jaeden Zackery (11.2 ppg, 4.3 apg at Boston College) to be the primary 1-man. If he's efficient, Clemson can hope to be in the realm of last season's 117.7 adjusted offensive efficiency rating (per KenPom), a program-best number. I think the Tigers are a moving target in the ACC but am willing to give Brownell the benefit of the doubt and buy in on continued success and a top-five league finish for the fourth time in five seasons.. Randy Bennett's Gaels have won 26 or 27 games in four of the past five seasons, with the COVID-affected 2020-21 campaign being the exception. It's fair to brace for a little step back here, as Aidan Mahaney left for UConn and Alex Ducas graduated. Josh Jefferson also decided to portal it out of there. I love that Mitchell Saxen is here again for a fifth and final season, though. I'd rank him among the 15 best bigs in the sport. With Saxen and the 7-1 Harry Wessels making life hell in the paint, Saint Mary's is again going to be rugged and not to be trifled with on defense. And sure, the Aussie pipeline is still flowing into Moraga, California, but Bennett's also added a couple of Lithuanians to boot. Had Mahaney stayed it would've benefited the program, but SMC fans know that Augustas Marciulionis was the team's better floor general anyway. He's back for a senior season on a squad that is again going to firmly be No. 2 in the WCC behind Gonzaga. Oh, nothing. It's only the most anticipated season in Rutgers history. Steve Pikiell and his assistant, Brandin Knight, diligently worked for years to recruit two blue-chip studs — Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey — and here they are. Yes, Rutgers will suit up quite possibly two future top-five NBA Draft picks. This is going to be fascinating, to say the least. Harper will run the offense; he's the younger brother of Ron Harper Jr., who is one of the best players in program history. Bailey is a bouncy wing who might be the most athletic freshman in the country. Those two won't explicitly be tasked with being the leaders of this team, but from the outside in, that's how it will be viewed. Harper and Bailey all but guarantee a big jump from last year's putrid offense, which ranked 295th at KenPom. Harper gets the benefit of starting beside Jeremiah Williams, who started 11 of his 12 games last season after returning from injury. No one's quite sure how this is going to go, and questions loom with RU's interior defense, but few teams in '24-25 will rank as high in watchability as the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. What a world. I like this world! The Aztecs get a top-40 designation from me due to coaching stability and proven culture. This program lost a LOT from 2023-24: Jaedon LeDee (that one's gonna leave a mark), Lamont Butler, Micah Parrish, Darrion Trammell. The best returnee is Reese Waters (9.6 ppg, 3.7 rpg). A year ago, nobody had LeDee as a top-20 player in the country, but that's precisely what he became. Can Waters make a jump that's in that ballpark? He'll get help with Miles Byrd, a stretchy wing who symbolizes a lot of what makes SDSU's defense so firm year in, year out. One new name to know is former FAU guard Nick Boyd, who has a swagger on the court that will fit right in with Brian Dutcher's program. Boyd might be good for a couple of 25-point nights, and in turn, could improve the Aztecs' chances at winning yet another Mountain West title. The MW will soon degrade, due to SDSU leaving alongside a few other teams. In these next two years, it should be a compelling battle for supremacy before this league is subdued — so soon after its best season in history. With a workable troop of fourth- and fifth-year players, plus the arrival of a five-star big man, the Terrapins can course-correct in a big way from last season's letdown. Kevin Willard's team was a confounding 16-17, done in by awful 3-point shooting and a stagnant offense. Look for that to change due to the arrival of Belmont transfer Ja'Kobe Gillespie (38.7% from beyond the arc) and South Florida import Selton Miguel (39%). Maryland lost Donta Scott and Jahmri Young, but Julian Reese is back in the frontcourt and will play the 4 alongside freshman center and local high school hero Derik Queen, who ranked 12th in the Class of 2024 according to 247Sports. Reese's defense should help Maryland rank well nationally in efficiency. I don't know if Queen will be high-impact in the first six weeks of the season, but I think he rounds into form by February and gets Maryland firmly into the bubble mix. The Longhorns' shift into the SEC (this feels like it's going to take some getting used to) is going to coincide with a big shift in the roster. A lot of old hands are no longer wearing burnt orange: Max Abmas, Dylan Disu, Tyrese Hunter, Dillon Mitchell, even Brock Cunningham (gone already? I jest) have moved on. That equates to 80% of the team's minutes flipping for the season ahead. Rodney Terry essentially has a rebuild on his hands, but at least he's got a terrific freshman wing in Tre Johnson to do it with. Johnson is the sleeper pick to be the nation's best freshman. Ranked sixth overall in the class, he was a big-gulp scorer as a prospect and figures to have a lot of touches on a team that will be looking for guys to step up on offense. Johnson figures to start alongside four other guys who are all much older and seniors/fifth-year players. Kadin Shedrick is the most important returning UT player; he'll hold down the 5. Arthur Kaluma is in Austin to chase the NCAA Tournament after missing out last year at Kansas State. Tramon Mark is back in the state after a one-year detour with Arkansas. Look for him to be critical as a leader for Terry's team, which has some interesting pieces. I can see a way for Texas to make hay in the new-look SEC, but it's likely going to be in the bubble mix come March. It's hard to catapult season-ending momentum into the following campaign, but let's see if Pitt can do it. I like the Panthers to be a bubble team after missing out (narrowly) on the NCAAs last season following a 10-3 finish and a 22-11 record. Jeff Capel is now in Year 7, with one NCAA trip in the first six. Pitt's AD was unexpectedly let go this offseason, which could put Capel's job at risk if he severely underachieves, but I like this team to comfortably finish in the top half of the ACC and make the Big Dance. The Panthers have somewhat quietly moved into second-tier status in the ACC in the past couple of years. Will this group keep that going? The roster suggests a competitive team with a reasonable shot at winning north of 20 games again. Ishmael Leggett is a key player back, as is Jaland Lowe, who will be a pop guy in 2024-25, especially after Bub Carrington's meteoric rise to one-and-done NBA Draft lottery pick. Lowe could follow Carrington's course in 2025, honestly. Blake Hinson also no longer being here also dings Pitt a bit, but, but, but: The Panthers return four of their top six scorers, which is about as good of a situation as you can ask for at a high-major school that didn't make the tournament. If you missed Jackson Shelstad's freshman year, don't make a similar mistake this upcoming season. Shelstad (12.8 ppg) is probably among the 10 best sophomores in the sport, and he'll have a shot at being a first- or second-team guy in the Big Ten. (Still feels weird to type it, let alone read it.) Dana Altman was hoping to win an NCAA appeal to get one more season with N'Faly Dante, but that didn't happen. Who's the big man to step up now? Senior Nathan Bittle, who will have to pop his 10.0 points/4.4 rebounds line from last season. After a one-year East Coast junket at Villanova, former Washington State wing TJ Bamba has returned West to suit up as a Duck. I suspect he'll get north of 320 shots in 30-plus games. This is Dana Altman's 15th season in Eugene. The previous 14 featured 20 wins or more. In fact, Altman's coached 27 consecutive years above .500. Oregon might have question marks, but the track record mandates putting the Ducks comfortably in the top 50. I was absurdly high on the Aggies last season (we're talking irrationally high), only to see Buzz Williams' team pretty much perform where most others thought they'd be. A 21-15 record and a No. 9 seed. So: they were solidly solid, but a few matters short of pretty good. Will this group be more consistent? Wade Taylor IV returns for his senior season, and after averaging 19.1 points in 2023-24 (fourth-best in the SEC), he's got a chance to be No. 1 in the conference. A lot will filter down from Taylor's production. Fellow senior backcourt mate Manny Obaseki will be inserted into the starting lineup full time, getting that promotion along with another semi-starter from last season, Jace Carter on the wing. My concern with ranking A&M higher is tied to the reality that Williams is yet to have a quality shooting team in his five seasons with the program. Every one he's had has rated outside the top 150 in 2- and 3-point percentage, many outside the top 200. Until that changes, A&M is going to have a limit on its proficiency and efficiency inside the SEC and out. After losing out to Duke in the high-stakes dual recruitment of Cameron and Cayden Boozer (who will be in college in 2025), Jim Larrañaga now focuses most of his energy on reversing the bad vibes that concluded Miami's 2023-24 season, an unspeakable 10-game nightmare that rendered the Canes irrelevant at 15-17. Nijel Pack and Matthew Cleveland decided to stay in Coral Gables, Florida, and that will prove vital to Miami's chances to be a bubble team in the ACC. The Hurricanes lost a lot from last season's team, but those two were the ones they couldn't afford to see leave. Cleveland and Pack joining forces with a fun freshman, shooting guard Jalil Bethea, in addition to Stetson transfer Jalen Blackmon (who had the game of his life in the ASUN title game, erupting for 43 points and getting the Hatters into the field of 68) will ensure this squad is potent and powerful in shot selection and creation. Few teams underachieved harder relative to the talent on the roster than The U a season ago. I can't see Larrañaga standing for that again. It might not be as good as Miami's football team in 2024, but The U will be back in the better half of the ACC. What a highly unusual situation in Columbus. Chris Holtmann was fired on Valentine's Day and everyone presumed the Buckeyes would chase, and land, a buzzy name. (Dusty May was the presumed initial target.) But Jake Diebler went from interim to full-time coach, thanks to going 8-3 after moving over a seat. Diebler has done well in his first season in terms of roster assembly. Most importantly, Bruce Thornton stuck around for one more season with the Bucks. I think he's got a great chance to be a top-five player in the Big Ten. He'll team up with boomerang transfer Meechie Johnson, who is back in an OSU uni after two years with South Carolina. Diebler recruited two former five-star prospects who didn't pan out at the blue-blood level: Sean Stewart (Duke) and Aaron Bradshaw (Kentucky). They're likely to start with another transfer, an understated team guy, Micah Parrish of San Diego State, who will be a utility guy to say the least. Not having Taison Chatman (torn ACL) will ding Ohio State's depth in the backcourt, unless 6-foot freshman Juni Mobley emerges as one of the best 3-point shooters in the Big Ten with haste. Diebler as a head coach of a high-major with no experience other than February and March's abbreviated trial run will make this a TBD season. But the talent should have OSU a bubble team at minimum. A year ago, I aggressively placed Georgia in the top 50 of my rankings, which I'm brave enough to admit was a fatuous mistake. This season, it's not such a fable. The Bulldogs fully expect to be competitive and in the top half of the SEC, thanks above all to anticipated reforms with the team's rebounding. (It's been baaaaaad.) Mike White has two players back who will be starters in Silas Demary Jr. and Blue Cain. Demary really might be the most undervalued player in the SEC. Also key: White has a freshman in Asa Newell who is the most talented newbie to come onto that campus (for basketball, anyway) since Anthony Edwards. Newell's game is nothing like Edwards, however. He's lean, stands approximately 6-10, can step out and shoot and plays with a good head on his shoulders. He'll need to be a top-10 freshman in the country to validate my UGA ranking, and I think he's gonna pull it off. Look for Demary to step up and be one of the best defenders in the SEC — with backup De'Shayne Montgomery not that far behind. Tyrin Lawrence (via Vandy) and RJ Godfrey (via Clemson) should round out the starting five. Kim English is on a mission to not put PC in the position it was last season, when spotty metrics results wound up holding the Friars outside the velvet rope to get into the NCAAs. That team won 21 games and did so without Bryce Hopkins (while Devin Carter turned into the Big East Player of the Year). Hopkins is back, however, and approaching 100% status after tearing his left ACL. Look for the combo forward to increase his previous Friar averages of 15.6 ppg and 8.6 rebounds, and in the process, potentially become the most valuable player on a Big East roster. English dipped into the portal and added Bensley Joseph (Miami), Wesley Cardet Jr. (Chicago State) and Christ Essandoko (Saint Joe's) to help out returning guard Jayden Pierre (9.5 ppg). With Josh Oduro now in the NBA, watch Oswin Erhunmwunse step in and patrol the paint. Every year when I build out this list, there are invariably a half-dozen power-conference teams that feel like their range could be anywhere from No. 30 to No. 70. Providence is one of those teams this year. The Lobos were laughably only put into the Big Dance last season because they won the Mountain West tourney title after an enthralling run that included five wins in the final six games prior to March Madness. UNM's inclusion gave the Mountain West a conference-record six bids. This team probably can't match the firepower and athleticism of that one, but it can best it in tenacity and resourcefulness. Much of that will spring from junior guard Donovan Dent, one of the best players in the Mountain West. Dent, whose gumption is on display multiple times a night, averaged 14.1 points and figures to up that number in 2024-25. He'll have returning C Nelly Junior Joseph starting with him, giving Richard Pitino's team a couple of go-to guys in very different positions. I have to ding UNM for the losses of Jaelen House, Jamal Mashburn Jr. and JT Toppin, but the program's arrow has been going in the good direction since Pitino arrived three years ago and doesn't seem likely to go crooked over the next six months. It's time for the Braves to ascend to the top of the Missouri Valley — and become one of the best mid-major teams in the process. Brian Wardle, in this his 10th season in Peoria, Illinois, has his best team. And consider: Bradley ranked 64th at KenPom last season. Thanks to returning much of his roster (led by point guard Duke Deen and 5-man Darrius Hannah), Wardle can rely on veteran experience and a locker room with great chemistry. The Braves have to overcome losing their leading scorer (Connor Hickman) and best defender (Malevy Lyons), but seem to have most boxes checked for a mid-major darling. Great size, culture established, good guard play, capable 3-point shooting. The Braves have two MVC tourney championships under Wardle but just one NCAA appearance because 2020 was ripped away. Drake had been the Cinderella candidate in the Valley in recent years, and now Bradley should take that mantle. The Blazers are equipped with four returning starters from a 23-win team. If Memphis doesn't wind up as the best team in the AAC, UAB (officially the preseason league favorite) is the obvious candidate to take the top slot. Any team that deploys a man in the middle with the first name Yaxel and a pesky guard nicknamed "Butta" figures to be set up for a certain level of success, deemed necessary by the basketball gods. Yaxel Lendeborg is a 6-9 hoss — a senior center who will threaten to finish with 25 double-doubles. Butta Johnson is a bit of a dynamo who should see his shot opportunities improve playing next to underrated Georgia Southern transfer Tyren Moore. UAB will be a problem in the American because Lendeborg is complemented by Christian Coleman, a power forward with a tough nose around the rim. Kennedy knows his team's defensive issues last season sold them short. We should expect a more well-rounded squad in Birmingham. Everyone knows the deal on the Main Line. Kyle Neptune needs to make the NCAA Tournament in order to get to a fourth year with Nova. The program has quickly gone from a rock-solid top-10 reputation to confounding disappointment over the past two seasons. Now the Cats ready for a campaign with only seven players holding D-I experience. Five of those seven, at least, are 21, 22 or 23 years old. Eric Dixon opted to stay, and that might be the thing that saves VU and keeps them competitive in the Big East. He and Jordan Longino will be the team's leaders, while Wooga Poplar (via Miami) was the Big Transfer Get that Nova desperately needed in the back end of the portal cycle. Villanova hasn't missed the NCAAs three years in a row since Jay Wright's first three on the Main Line (2002-04). In order to avoid that in 2025, Neptune's going to have to overachieve with a roster that ranks well outside the top five of the Big East. A program under pressure that has responded well in previous iterations. What will this one do? If you're outside the top 50 you probably aren't in as a bubble team come March, but I think BU is one of the best sleeper NCAA candidates out there. Thad Matta's toiled a bit for two years in Indy, yes, however his coaching acumen can't be questioned. By bringing back much of the roster from an 18-win team, the expectation should be to hit 20 victories. The two biggest names still here are G/F Pierre Brooks and F Jahmyl Telfort. They'll be wonderful on a team that should move into the top 50 of offensive efficiency. I do wonder about the defensive integrity and the lack of higher-end athletes. Tulane transfer Kolby King is a guy who will also emerge here, but needs to beef up into a strong two-way player to bolster the loss of Posh Alexander. A veritable mid-major beast these days. Bryce Drew's program is coming off a first-round upset of Saint Mary's in the 5/12 game, giving GCU a program-record 30th win in the process. The Antelopes were 65th in my rankings a year ago, which proved too low. I'm bumping 'em up that much more heading into November. Four starters return, led by Tyon Grant-Foster, a 20-point-per-game guard who is one of the three-or-so most talented mid-major players in the sport. If bringing back a healthy portion of the team's scoring and minutes wasn't enough to convince you this team can win another NCAA Tournament game, know that TCU transfer JaKobe Coles and his 42% 3-point accuracy is also in the mix here. The Lopes are overwhelming WAC favorites yet again before the program moves on to the WCC next year. Non-Rambler fans, If I ask you what this team's win total was last season, you think you can guess it within two spots? Loyola Chicago went 23-10 in a critical bounce-back campaign after the disastrous 10-win season the year prior. For as good and improved as LUC was last season, the program sure didn't seem like it received a fair amount of attention and publicity. Drew Valentine will need to have another 20-win season to get his flowers, and I'm here to project he will. Three starters are back at a program that retained five rotation players in all and should have the makings of a top-40 per-possession defense. Miles Rubin averaged just 6.2 points, but I don't know how many players who didn't score 10 per game were more valuable, at least at the mid-major level, than him. He set the program record with 76 blocks in a season. Rubin, Des Watson (high-end A-10 player) and Jayden Dawson will be the triumvirate taking on a not-so-mysterious-but-still-sorta-unpredictable top third of the Atlantic 10. The Ramblers upgraded to this conference from the MVC two years ago. This is the season they show they made the right decision. Here's a big swing. It was a slog in Year 1 under Micah Shrewsberry, as anticipated, but I'm tagging the Irish to be one of the more surprising high-majors in the months ahead. Shrews was able to retain four starters, the most important being point guard Markus Burton (17.5 ppg, 4.3 apg, 3.3 rpg at 5-foot-11). Burton gets to play beside a utilitarian transfer who should fit like a glove: Princeton guard Matt Allocco. ND brings back guys who don't have big Q scores but are highly valued on that campus: Tae Davis, Braeden Shrewsberry and J.R. Konieczny. The Irish are going to punch above their weight and steal a few games as a home underdog. The program's been on fire recently with some big-time recruiting wins. Notre Dame will likely be a projected NCAA team a year from now, but in this bridge season I like Shrewsberry's crew to go from 13 wins to at least five more than that in '24-25. With all due respect to the predictive metrics out there and how they're formulated and calculated, the Bulls team I saw last season looked better than the one listed online. USF ranked 87th at KenPom, 84th at Torvik, 78th at EvanMiya and 91st at BPI. I'm not going to say USF was a top-60 team last season, because the data's in and the data across different algorithms is correct. However, if you watched USF occasionally and saw how that fan base was reinvigorated, how well-coached it was under Amir Abdur-Rahim and its new life as a 25-win team, you saw top-50 aura. Despite Abdur-Rahim not taking a bigger job after just one year, but losing vital pieces regardless, I'm buying in with the Bulls. I think they play their way to a second consecutive 20-win season. I think they build on a fun story in Tampa. I think they do it behind lead guard Jayden Reid. He's an easy candidate for AAC POY consideration, and he'll likely be tasked with a lot after USF got poached in the portal. Reid has Brandon Stroud and Kobe Knox flanking him, giving the Bulls the uncommon situation of coming off a good year with returning pieces, but likely being underrated. (Except here, of course.) USF has a good policy in place: replace the departing coach with the best-qualified in-house candidate. It did this in 2019 when Kyle Smith left and Todd Golden scooted a seat over. Then, when Golden took the Florida job in 2022, Chris Gerlufsen was promoted from within. Since then, the Dons have gone 43-25 and maintained top-four status in the WCC, which is where they'll be again for the next five months. Gerlufsen is fortunate to return four high-leverage players from last season's 23-11 team: Marcus Williams, Malik Thomas and Ndewedo Newbury (all seniors), plus sophomore combo guard (and somewhat rare non-Gonzaga WCC freshman of the year winner) Ryan Beasley. This team wasn't free throw-prone a season ago, something that should change for the better. A nice offense is likely to upgrade to a good one, and the defense can again be top-60 in the nation. That will lay the course for USF's inside track to third place in the WCC behind Gonzaga and Saint Mary's. What Will Wade did to change the situation in mere months' time in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is outrageous. McNeese won 30 games last year and finished 67th at KenPom, by far its best ever. Prior to 2023-24, McNeese's average KenPom finish in its history was 257th; the Cowboys finished between 276 and 335 in the 11 preceding years. Then Wade arrives and all the suck and ineptitude is vaporized out of the program. McNeese had a 19-game turnaround, tying an NCAA record. And remember, Wade had to sit for the opening stretch of last season because of suspension. Of course, he's only there because of the NCAA violations and stain from his LSU days, but regardless, this is now a low-major monster. McNeese will rule the Southland with ease again. Look for Christian Shumate (awesome two-way player), Ole Miss transfer Brandon Murray and Saint Louis transfer Sincere Parker to guide the Cowboys to at least 25 wins again. THE story with Wisconsin is how it fares after being brutalized by the portal ("portalized"?) after being upset as a 5-seed in the first round by James Madison. The Badgers watched Chucky Hepburn (Louisville), AJ Storr (Kansas) and Connor Essegian (Nebraska) walk away, dropping their ceiling in the process. This is a program that's held a lot of stability in roster retention — doing so against the currents of the sport — but this year was different. At least Steven Crowl, Max Klesmit and John Blackwell stuck around. (Tyler Wahl graduated, alas.) There can be good portal news, though: John Tonje was a non-factor at Mizzou last year because of injury, but it wouldn't stun me at all if he was a double-double guy in his final college season. Greg Gard has a big task ahead in what seems fated to have Wisconsin floating in the middle of a boggy Big Ten. One of about five teams in the ACC that I think has the capacity to finish as high as seventh and as low as 15th. It's just so tough to tell in this first year of overwrought high-major expansion. The Orange bring back JJ Starling, who's a lot of fun and should be in striking distance of averaging 17 points. Eddie Lampkin (previously of TCU and Colorado renown) will pay rent on the low block for his final year of eligibility. Junior wing Chris Bell (41.7% from 3-point land) is underrated and may unlock this team's ceiling. Hofstra transfer Jaquan Carlos is also getting some buzz in the preseason, so we're on the lookout for him. I like the Orange to finish top 10 in the ACC, but it could be a bumpy route to the finish. Consider how Red Autry won 20 games in his debut season. SU should be in that range again. This is a respectable jump from last season's Mississippi debut for Chris Beard, which included 20 wins (good) but also had the Rebels finish 79th at Torvik and 86th at KenPom (not good). The Rebels return PG Jaylen Murray and combo guard Matthew Murrell, in addition to 6-8 wing Jaemyn Brakefield. The defense was barely adequate at times, and now Jamarion Sharp, Moussa Cisse and Allen Flanigan have moved on. Can the group be collectively better? How will the scheme change? There's a lot to prove in the frontcourt. I've got some reservations over Beard getting this new roster (which includes four senior transfers, led by Sean Pedulla and Dre Davis) to be good enough on defense to make the NCAA Tournament. But the scoring capability will likely lead to some barn-burning atmospheres every month. Someone's going to surprise in the Big 12. Why not the Knights? Johnny Dawkins' team had three eyebrow-raising wins last season (Kansas, at Texas and at TCU), which has me thinking this program could be in for more party spoiling. Because UCF isn't appointment TV, it has one of the most unheralded (but reliable) duos in high-major ball. Watch out for guards Jaylin Sellers and Darius Johnson. They combined to average 31 points last season and could hit the 35 mark this season. The strange thing here is there's a bunch of guys on this roster who back stories that are longer than novellas (Mikey Williams, Dior Johnson, Benny Williams), but if the chemistry is in line, UCF will have top-half-of-the-league talent in the Big 12. And should the defense again rate top-30, like last year, then this outlook won't be bullish. Wolf Pack fans found me with a quickness a year ago when I stupidly neglected to include Nevada in my top 101. (Steve Alford's team was soundly in the top 60 of all metrics at year's end.) No such mistake this year. This is easily a top-70 roster. Alford is running it back with his three best at the 3, 4 and 5: Tre Coleman, Nick Davidson and KJ Hymes. Not many teams are able to claim the same. Look for Nevada to be in the thick of the NCAA convo because of its size and know-how. The backcourt of Tyler Rolison (big-time role increase) and Kobe Sanders (Cal Poly transfer) might take a little time to jell, but so long as they're counterplaying off the gravity from the aforementioned frontcourt, Rolison and Sanders are going to have a lot of chances to capitalize with the spacing provided in Alford's system. If not for super-senior guard Max Shulga, the Rams would be about two dozen spots further down on this list. Shulga, who has spent his career with coach Ryan Odom, had a few weeks over the spring where he opted for a future at Villanova. But after careful consideration, he doubled back to Richmond and will be the focal point on one of the best teams in the A-10. Putting it plainly: VCU has valid NCAA hopes because Shulga's here. As a career 40% 3-point shooter, his leadership by example will be vital. Remember, the Rams went 24-14 last season and would have made the NCAA Tournament had they not stubbed their toe in the conference title game against Duquesne. Odom brings back three starters (Shulga, Joe Bamisile, Zeb Jackson) who also led the team in scoring, giving this group a realistic chance not just at winning the A-10, but at making up ground in the nonconference, where games and scheduling never come easy for VCU. I count no more than three programs, max, that will have to overcome the loss of a player the way Northwestern will with Boo Buie, who graduated as NU's all-time leading scorer. That aside, times are pretty sweet now in Evanston, Illinois. Chris Collins guided the team to a second straight NCAA Tournament bid, which was previously considered a fantasy for a school with just three of those in its history. NU will drag some higher-end Big Ten teams into escape room-type scenarios at Welsh-Ryan Arena, where it's had a handful of loud upset wins over ranked opponents in recent seasons. Key names back: Brooks Barnhizer, Ty Berry, Nick Martinelli. Barnhizer is quite the well-rounded player, especially when you consider how much time he spends on the floor (more than 90% of minutes last season) without having noticeable efficiency drop-offs. Chris Jans is the only coach in Bulldogs history to make the NCAAs in his first two seasons. (He's the only coach to reach the Big Dance in Year 1, too.) It's been a really good fit from the get-go in Starkville. The Bulldogs do have quite the makeover, bringing aboard six transfers and two freshmen. The best player back is one of the best sophomores in college basketball. Josh Hubbard averaged 17.1 points as a 5-9 combo guard in a defense-leaning scheme. Can't wait to see how he follows up a delectable debut season. Hubbard is the guy on offense, while Cameron Matthews is the platonic ideal of a switchable 6-7 defender. MSU figures to rank top-30 in defensive efficiency behind the captaincy of Matthews, who will be in the mix for SEC Defensive Player of the Year. I presume I'll be lower on the Bulldogs than other preseason rankings. It's not about Jans. Instead, it's more due to the very likely scenario the SEC is a top-two league, in addition to my wait-and-see approach on the portal compilation in Starkville, which needs to prove its offensive capacity. Most everyone (yep, yours truly included) was wrong a year ago when BYU was projected in the bottom half of the Big 12, only to see Mark Pope win 23 games and finish in the top 20 in advanced-metrics rankings. Now Pope is at Kentucky and Kevin Young — a longtime NBA assistant, most recently with the Suns — has made the pivot to the college game. This will be one fascinating experiment, as Young is going to try to NBA-ify the Cougs while also adhering to certain structure and schemes fitted for college. Fortunately for Young, he was able to retain Dallin Hall, Trevin Knell, Fousseyni Traore and Richie Saunders, all of whom could have left but chose to keep on with BYU's unique culture. It's likely to be bumpy in Year 1, but the vision is to fund BYU and turn it into one of the top four programs in the Big 12 by the end of the decade. (Case in point: The Cougars are a major player for the top prospect in the country, AJ Dybantsa.) Young might pull a Pope and wildly overshoot expectations again, but I'll give the Coogs plenty of slack in his first season. What the Wolfpack did in March/April amounted to the most statistically improbable Final Four run ever. From trailing putrid Louisville in the first half of the first game of the ACC tourney to winning nine straight (which had never been done before) and making history in reaching the Final Four. Will there be a hangover in Raleigh? DJ Burns, Casey Morsell and DJ Horne won't be there to experience it. Kevin Keatts returns Jayden Taylor, Michael O'Connell and Ben Middlebrooks. Louisville transfer Brandon Huntley-Hatfield will step in and play the 4 and/or the 5 and probably be ecstatic to be in new surroundings. Last season's team found a way to scout effectively, capitalize on mismatches (a lot of this was Burns) and never take stretches off in games. It will need to do this to maximum effect in order to get back to the NCAAs. Ohio is blessed to bring back six of its top eight players from last season. Senior guard Shereef Mitchell is the latest sturdy captain in the backcourt. Combo forward AJ Clayton is one of the best 3-point-shooting frontcourt players at his level. He hit 40.1% of his triples a season ago. It's the MAC, so the league tournament is far from fair to the top seed, but it's probably rational to expect one of Akron, Ohio or Toledo to wind up winning the conference. With Akron losing too much firepower from a 24-win team and Toledo rebuilding half its roster, Jeff Boals' Bobcats are my pick to emerge as the top squad in a quintessential mid-major league. The Shockers were merely 15-19 a season ago, but it was Paul Mills' first season on the job after doing a wonderful six-year stay with Oral Roberts. Mills brings back five of his top seven minutes-getters, which should convey an above-.500 season. Wichita State figures to get consistent scoring from guards Xavier Bell and Harlond Beverly, who lead a group that's old-old. A lot of teams in this sport are veteran-capped, given this is the final year of the COVID bonus year, but Wichita State's projected starting five will rank near the top in experience. All five are fourth- and fifth-year players, and Mills will have three more battle-scarred seniors readily available off the bench. Projecting WSU as a top-75 team is a dart in the dark, but the program has the players and figures to have the coaching. Beyond that, the American Athletic Conference on average is able to put four teams into the top 75. Let's give 'em a shot. The Red Wolves should supplant James Madison as the premier team in the Sun Belt. Arkansas State was so feared that Memphis and Alabama were the only two schools from high-major and/or multi-bid leagues this past offseason that agreed to play Bryan Hodgson's team. Hodgson, a second-year coach, has done an outstanding job after spending eight years learning under Nate Oats. Three starters return from the program's second 20-win season since 1998. (A young Grant McCasland was responsible for the other one in 2017.) Taryn Todd and Derrian Ford are the notable guys back, but the spark plug should be Louisiana transfer Kobe Julien, who averaged 17+ last season. Craig Smith has gone from 11 wins to 17 to 22 in his first three years in Salt Lake City. The task to get even more in Year 4 will be immense. The Utes lost Branden Carlson to graduation and Deivon Smith to St. John's, which is going to be a big hit, as those were two of the 10 best players in the Pac-12 last season. Now Utah's in the Big 12. It returns Gabe Madsen, the only player back who was a double-digit scorer last season (13.2 ppg). Lawson Lovering and Hunter Erickson are also key returnees. Stretchy San Francisco guard Mike Sharavjamts is poised to be a difference-maker, and Baylor transfer Miro Little should also be featured in the starting lineup. The Pirates narrowly missed last year's NCAAs (then won the NIT) and, even worse, lost Kadary Richmond to Big East rival St. John's. Shaheen Holloway won 17 games in Year 1 and 25 last season. I think he splits that in '24-25 and ends up with either 20 or 21 Ws. Dylan Addae-Wusu and Isaiah Coleman return; expect both to become double-digit scorers after combining to average 14 points last season. Holloway brought on seven transfers, the most notable being an intra-league Big East swap of his own in Garwey Dual (Providence). The implied lack of 3-point prowess is striking. Without enough long-distance threats, it is hard to get the Hall higher on the list than this. That said, while it's casual to underestimate this team, keep in mind Holloway's one of the best do-more-with-less coaches in the high-major ranks. Few folks in the media were as consistently pro-Isaiah Stevens over the past two years as your humble author here. Stevens stuck around in Fort Collins when he easily could have left in 2022 or 2023 and sought bigger NIL paydays. He guided CSU as a point guard with few peers (if any) at his level. Now that his college career is done, the Rams have to hope Northern Iowa transfer Bowen Born can facilitate and guide the ship. It won't be easy, but at least Nique Clifford (a multi-tool 6-5 wing) is back. Clifford figures to be a first team-type of All-Mountain West player. He averaged 12.2 points and that number is a stone-cold lock to inflate. Clifford was a down-transfer from Colorado who is a primo example of how moving to a lower level can vastly improve a player's college experience. Niko Medved also brings back Jalen Lake in a starting role. Probably won't compete for the Mountain West title but should be good enough to flirt with the bubble. I was on hand in Manhattan in March for the Tigers' stunning 90-81 loss in the Ivy League Tournament semifinals to Brown. (Princeton trailed by as many as 22 in that game.) Coach Mitch Henderson was visibly and understandably furious in the aftermath. That aggravation should serve as a motivator, not an inhibitor, for the Tigers in what should be another very good year in Princeton. Last season's team was 24-3 before losing its final two games. Crucially, it returns shooting guard Xaivian Lee, who is the most talented player in the Ivy. But he wasn't the 2024 Ivy POY. That would be Caden Pierce, who is also still wearing black and orange. Those two give the Tigers dependability, leadership and star power. If Henderson enables it, Pierce and Lee could rank among the highest-scoring duos in the country. Both are capable of averaging 20 if they want it. Russell Turner has built up one of the strongest mid-major résumés in the game. With a 289-180 record in 14 seasons, he's finished half of his campaigns with the best team in the Big West. That should be the case again in 2024-25 because the Anteaters have four starters sticking around from a 24-win team that finished 82nd at KenPom. It would come as no shock if this team wound up having a top-50 defense, too. UCI has won on the strength of its bigs in the past, but this group figures to carve its way to another 20-win year based on the depth of its guards. The two starters who should pace this group are Justin Hohn and Andre Henry — a duo that should wind up being the best 3-point shooting backcourt in the Big West. Few coaches have ever had bigger jumps in success in their first three years of Division I coaching than Josh Schertz. His first season at Indiana State was 11-20. Then he went 23-13 in 2022-23. Last season ISU made the NIT title game and went 32-7. If not for an unprecedented amount of bid thieves, the Sycamores would have been in the NCAAs. And Schertz might be coaching at Louisville if they had danced. Instead, Saint Louis is the spot, and it feels right. This is a good jump and the type of hire that SLU fans can eagerly embrace. They've got a shot to once again have a relevant program in short order. A big reason is because Schertz brought MVC Player of the Year Robbie Avila with him. The lovable baller with too many great nicknames (Cream Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Nerd, Steph Blurry) instantly becomes the must-watch player in the A-10. Isaiah Swope (who sank 114 treys a season ago) also made the move down from Indiana State to be a Billiken. Schertz's avant-garde offense combined with some shrewd roster-building provides instant credibility. Eric Musselman won 24 games in his first season at Nevada (2015-16) and 20 in his first at Arkansas (2019-20). Neither team made the NCAAs, and it seems more likely than not that will be true of the Trojans in their first year under Muss and in the West Coast-ified Big Ten. A double-digit transfer load comes aboard, many of them one-year guys in a grad-school year. Led most likely by Desmond Claude (Xavier), it's unclear just how well this group of ballers from Boise State, UMass, UC San Diego, Michigan, Northern Colorado and beyond will jell. Muss is right at home in SoCal, and if it hits, this has a shot to be the one job he sticks at for the better part of a decade. But it's hard to see this assembly as a top-half Big Ten outfit. After regularly rating in the top 100 when Phil Martelli was there, SJU finally broke back into that echelon again by finishing 99th at KenPom last season, Billy Lange's fifth tour. I think the Hawks can be similarly good, if not even slightly better, due to all-Atlantic 10 guard Erik Reynolds II playing one final season on the hill. Reynolds' 17.3 points per game led the league, and teaming up alongside returnee Xzayvier Brown (12.7 ppg) will give the Hawks one of the best backcourt tandems in the A-10. Brown is a stud and could compete with Reynolds for A-10 POY honors. Rasheer Fleming is also back, giving SJU three starting players who stuck around and averaged double digits. That's a luxury few non-high-major programs can claim in 2024. It's a reboot in Fort Worth for Jamie Dixon. The Horned Frogs figure to start four transfers alongside returning center Ernest Udeh Jr. Dixon will also have seven players on the roster yet to play a college game. That's going to lead to piles of losses in the Big 12. Unavoidable. I like the addition of Arizona State transfer Frankie Collins, who will be the head of the snake. He'll be flanked by Noah Reynolds (via Green Bay) and Brendan Wenzel (via Wyoming). TCU is coming off its third straight NCAA appearance, which had never happened in program history. A step or two back in '24-25 is almost certainly coming, but that's no indictment on Dixon's track record. Ben Jacobson has been ping-ponging between good and bad seasons for almost a decade. Here's UNI's win totals, starting in 2016 and up through last season: 23, 14, 16, 16, 25, 10, 20, 14, 19. The Panthers haven't won at least 19 games in back-to-back seasons since their two most recent NCAA Tournament showings in 2015/16. While Bradley is clearly the preseason No. 1 in the MVC, Northern Iowa is a fair pick to finish second — and have its best two-year push since 2016. Well-rounded power wing Tytan Anderson and 6-4 point guard Trey Campbell will guide the way in Cedar Falls. A bizarrely god-awful season (from 25-10 in Dennis Gates' first year to 8-24 last season, including going 0-19 in the SEC) meant Mizzou was one of the most shocking bad teams in the country. There are reasons for belief in a healthy turnaround, though. The Tigers figure to play seven guys in the primary rotation who are juniors, seniors or fifth-year players. Wing Tamar Bates (13.5 ppg) returns alongside Caleb Grill, who only played nine games due to injury but should become a double-digit scorer. Duke transfer power forward Mark Mitchell was a crucial portal pickup, as was Iowa's Tony Perkins on the wing. The Tigers will be better built to withstand the rigors of the SEC banked on a vastly improved defense. Gates is too good of a coach to have a terrible team in back-to-back seasons. Fran McCaffery has a good shot at coaching another First Team All-Big Ten player. Payton Sandfort is coming into his fourth season of college ball, having averaged 16.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and shot 37.9% from beyond the arc last season. He's going to be Iowa's No. 1 (and likely No. 2) option on offense as the Hawkeyes look to finish top-20 in offensive efficiency (per KenPom) for an eighth straight season. The defensive concerns are again heavy, which is why I'm predicting a subpar campaign in Iowa City, but if you like the Hawkeyes you should feel great. I don't think there's a team I'm more often wrong about heading into a season than Iowa. Louisville fans aren't looking for a lulu of a season, but they do think Pat Kelsey recruited a roster good enough to go from 12 total wins in two years under Kenny Payne to an NCAA bid in Year 1 of Kelsey. We shall see. As I said on the Eye on College Basketball Podcast last week, Louisville is among the toughest teams to peg in the ACC. Just an outright rebuild emerging from an awful situation. Working in Kelsey's favor: His only season below .500 was his first as a head coach in 2012-13 at Winthrop (14-17). The Cards bring on Chucky Hepburn from Wisconsin, Terrence Edwards Jr. from JMU — who was REALLY good — plus Noah Waterman via BYU, a few guys from Charleston and Kasean Pryor from South Florida. I want to see how the pieces coagulate and I want to see if Kelsey can and does play as up-tempo with U of L as he did with Winthrop and Charleston. James Jones needs four more wins to hit 400 for his career, which should culminate before we get to December. Jones is one of the longest-tenured coaches in Division I; this is his 26th season with the Bulldogs. (It's to Yale's benefit, but this guy should have been hired to a bigger job three-to-eight years ago, frankly.) With Jones still operating in his prime, Yale can be a top-100 team for the fifth time in seven seasons. With Princeton the practical pick to win the Ivy, Yale is the evident No. 2 — and may well win the league's automatic bid again in the intimate and pressurized confines of that league bracket. The Elis lost Danny Wolf to Michigan, otherwise they'd be my preseason pick. Bez Mbeng and John Poulakidas (who had 28 vs. Auburn in the tournament) are back to ball in New Haven, Connecticut. After three consecutive 20-win seasons for a program that's produced a couple of top-20 NBA picks (Jalen Williams, Brandin Podziemski) as of late, let's toss them into the 100 And 1. Herb Sendek has a really good staff and didn't lose anyone to the portal (less than 10 teams did in all of college hoops) and should have nine guys playing double-digit minutes, which is why I've got the Broncos positioned to finish in the top four of the WCC. You best believe that Adama-Alpha Bal (a top-10 name in the sport) is ready for his senior year close-up. He'll team up with Johnny O'Neil, who is a jack-of-all-trades type … at 6-10. The top four of the WCC looks good again. It's a shame that the league is losing Gonzaga in two years, but that will help programs like Santa Clara break through after the breakup. Alan Huss had one of the best debut coaching seasons Division I has seen — regardless of conference designation — in recent memory. He took over the Panthers last season and transformed a school that averaged 13 wins over the previous seven seasons into a 27-9 inaugural campaign. Unfortunately for High Point, it got picked off in the Big South Tournament against Longwood, losing a heartbreaker by one in OT. Now Huss gets four starters back, including potential Big South POY Kezza Giffa and second-year defensive standout Juslin Bodo Bodo. The Gamecocks lost three of their top four scorers, who accounted for nearly 38 points per game, but do bring back one of the best sophomores in the country. Collin Murray-Boyles may sound like the name of the second-best striker for Ireland's World Cup team, but no. He's a 6-7 forward who has a great opportunity to step into the spotlight and be one of the five best players in the SEC. The lack of proven pieces around Murray-Boyles has me hesitant overall on the Gamecocks, who were one of the surprises of 2023-24 after winning 26 games and earning a No. 6 seed despite being picked dead last in the then-14-team SEC. The Hokies — and a few teams like them — will be interesting test cases for predictive metrics in this new phase of 16- and 18-team megaconferences. If a team like this goes 18-16 and finishes four games below .500 in league play, will it still work its way into the top 75? Glancing at VT's roster, you can make a case for not including this team in the top 101. But I will because Mike Young's a really good coach and should squeeze a lot out of his roster. Young is 92-66 in five seasons in Blacksburg, holding a 50-52 mark against ACC opponents. Virginia Tech brings aboard Charleston's Ben Burnham and Temple's Hysier Miller as its biggest stat guys in the portal. The attrition is huge; no ACC team that didn't undergo a coaching change lost a bigger dose of its roster than the Hokies. This one's admittedly a hunch based on little evidence. But guess what? Teams make huge jumps from well outside the top 100 every year. It's part of the fun of watching the season unfold. We've got two years until the Pac-12 revives. During its interregnum, Oregon State (and Washington State) are taking up residency in the WCC. I think the move will do wonders for Wayne Tinkle's program. Plus, the Beavers are loaded with guys between 6-7 and 7 feet. As Dan Patrick once said: Welcome to the Big Show. Can't wait to see how this roster-building approach fares in a mid-major league. The WCC schedule is now 18 games, with a home-and-home against Gonzaga guaranteed. Get this: Oregon State is 25-2 vs. Gonzaga, and 11-0 since Gonzaga went Division I in the early 1960s. The teams last met in 1991! Putting faith in a remarkable second-year spike for Georgetown under Ed Cooley. No. 90 doesn't get you anywhere near the NCAA tourney convo obviously, but I'll take a flier on Georgetown hitting 15 wins, upgrading its defense and beating at least three non-DePaul teams in the Big East. Malik Mack could be the star. The Harvard transfer is likely to be a high-volume producer alongside junior guard Jayden Epps. The addition of TCU forward Micah Peavy should provide G'town a necessary older-guy presence on a team that's got a lot of freshmen. What a story. Bucky McMillan, who grew up four miles from Samford and has lived his whole life in Birmingham, Alabama, took his BuckyBall style to its maximum potential (seemingly) by going from six wins in Year 1 to 27 and an NCAA Tournament berth in Year 4. Samford was 81st at KenPom last season after falling to Kansas in controversial fashion in the first round of the Big Dance. McMillan lost four starters, but I'd bank on this team being able to average north of 77 or 78 points (last year: 81.4) because of the style of play. Rylan Jones is the lone returning starter on a team that's projected to be the best in the SoCon. A lot of players are going to have an increase in minutes and impact. McMillan's press-for-40-minutes-no-matter-what blueprint is the only one of its kind in college basketball. Here are the teams outside the high-major leagues with the most wins over the last eight seasons: Gonzaga (121), Belmont (120) and Vermont (115). John Becker has made the NCAAs six times; 2025 feels like it will be No. 7 in Burlington. Related: UVM has ranked top-100 at KenPom six times in Becker's tenure; 2025 feels like it will be No. 7 in Burlington. Becker should be taking calls from dozens of coaches across the country so they can learn his secret for avoiding invariable pitfalls that affect most other mid-majors. Four starters are back from a No. 13 seed that went 28-7. Shamir Bogues seems to be the next big name in the Green Mountain State, but beyond individual play, Becker believes this team could be one of his best on defense. The Tigers have a chance to be the surprise mid-major team in the sport. Pat Skerry's team lost just two hoopers from last year's lineup that won 20 games (and they were to graduation and a down-transfer to D-II). In total, 10 out of 11 possible returnees are back. Understand: This kind of retention scenario will present itself maybe two or three times at the non-military mid-major level moving forward. A really good story is brewing here. Four players returned who averaged double figures, led by Christian May and Dylan Williamson. In total, 81% of the team's scoring returns and Skerry probably will go 10-deep well into league play. To me, the narrow favorites over Charleston in a competitive top end of the CAA. I dithered between FAU or UNT as the last team from the American in the back of the Top 100 And 1. I'll lean Mean Green due to not having a coaching change and the program ranking top-90 in multiple metrics four years running. Due to losing four starters, the Mean Green probably take a step back, but Ross Hodge's defensive scheme is going to ensure this team is second tier at worst in the AAC. Hodge is a top-10 (maybe top-five) defensive coach in the country. But without a threatening scorer, things get problematic. I think the name to watch is Atin Wright, a transfer from Drake who can shoot from deep and is going to be North Texas' spreader on offense. It's easy to overlook a team that wins by committee the way UNT has in recent years, but until I see results that justify putting this program outside the top 101, I won't do it. The Nittany Lions have five seniors back. Ace Baldwin is probably going to destroy opposing guards' spirits with almost every assignment he gets. That guy is worth the price of admission. No, PSU doesn't have great basketball history, but Mike Rhoades' track record (389-206 in his career, including a decade in D-III) suggests this team is being underrated heading into the season. Again, the Big Ten is such a foggy set of circumstances, but something tells me Rhoades' team will play spoiler on multiple nights this season. Over the past 20 years, with only a few exceptions, the MVC has placed at least three teams in the top 100 of a variety of metrics by season's end. I think 2025 will sustain the pattern. I've got Bradley in the top 50, Northern Iowa 16 spots north of this, and now we welcome the Murray State Racers back into the top-100 club. The team is one of my picks for one of the biggest turnarounds in the sport. Steve Prohm's program won only 12 games last season. So, why so much faith? Eight juniors and seniors will take up the entirety of the rotation, with a reasonable expectation that this will be a top-two defense in the Valley. At the 1 is JaCobi Wood, who won't exactly be Ja Morant, but I think he's poised to be one of only a handful of guys in D-I to average 15/5/5. If it all comes together, he could do that and creep up on 40% shooting from 3-point range. It would be easy to dismiss OSU after a lackluster run at the end of Mike Boynton's tenure, a subsequent coaching hire and inevitable massive roster flip. But the new coach is Steve Lutz, who has made the past three NCAA tourneys while at Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Western Kentucky. He's a really good coach and previously worked under Matt Painter at Purdue and Greg McDermott at Creighton. Most importantly, Lutz wound up recruiting one of the oldest rosters in high-major ball, which I expect to translate to a solid Year 1. The familiar name is Bryce Thompson, who opted to stick it out in Stillwater after Boynton's departure. The new name is Devo Davis, who can be hit-or-miss but needs to hit big to give the Cowboys a spoiler's chance in the 16-team Big 12. The Buffaloes are losing a lot. The most talented team in program history, essentially. Gone: Tristan da Silva, KJ Simpson, Cody Williams, all NBA picks, two of them first rounders. And Eddie Lampkin Jr. is gone as well. Tad Boyle's had some really good years with lowered expectations. Let's see if he can pull off another one here, because it looks to be a tough slog ahead as Colorado transitions into the Big 12. It's anyone's guess as to who steps up in a starring role, but the candidates are Washington State transfer Andrej Jakimovski and top returning reserve Julian Hammond III. On a side note, I'm not sure there's a greater personality disparity in coaches at the high-major level than Deion Sanders and Tad Boyle. Frank Martin won 15 games in Year 1, 20 last season, so why not sign up for the Minutemen to be near the top of the A-10? It's an ambitious forecast, but Martin's force of will tends to have his rosters outperform expectations. Simply put, there will be 10-15 teams that easily rank top-100 come March but that can't be found inside the preseason top 100 at any predictive metrics site today. I'll go with UMass as one of those teams. Shooting guard Rahsool Diggins is back; expect him to drop 15 points per night. Sophomore point guard Jaylen Curry should shine. This is UMass' final season in the A-10, by the way. The school idiotically voted to leave and chase ill-fated football dreams in the MAC starting in 2025, a decision that's alienated a heavy portion of the school's alumni base. It's fair to say Bobby Hurley is in a hot-seat season, due to the new-look Big 12 and the fact ASU has finished sub-.500 in three of the past four years. If 2025 doesn't include an NCAA bid, change could be in the offing. And so, in comes the highest-rated frosh class of Hurley's career. One of the surprise roster additions of the offseason was ASU landing five-star Jayden Quaintance, who could help prove this ranking too dismissive. Best of all, due to his age, he's not eligible to be drafted until 2026. It's not just Quaintance; ASU also got a football-style flip in Joson Sanon, who balked on his commitment to Arizona and took to Tempe. I've got the Sun Devils low, however, because relying on freshmen and portal adds from the mid-major ranks (Missouri State's Alston Mason and Milwaukee's BJ Freeman are expected to be prominently featured) could be a challenging playbook in the best league in the country. The Cornhuskers are coming off only their second NCAA Tournament bid since 1998. This was a sweet story last season, but the bounce-back could be difficult. Keisei Tominaga's off conquering the world these days; the sport will miss him so. Critically, Rienk Mast is out for the season because of a knee injury. That lowers NU's ceiling due to Mast's vastly underrated skillset. Look for returnees Brice Williams and Juwan Gary to be high-leverage, positionless-type players, though maximizing their success could be attached to Utah transfer point guard Rollie Worster, who missed much of last season to injury. So there's your widespread preview. Want more hoops previews? We've got a lot in stock already. To start, head here for our preseason All-America teams and our preseason awards. If you want even more detailed previews of the high-major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12 and the SEC) and a best-of-the-rest lookahead outside the power leagues. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The hope. The anticipation. Sneakers squeaking. Basketballs bouncing. Whistles chirping. Coaches already in full-throat before the season is in full throe. Find a quiet spot and, if you really try hard enough, you'll hear college basketball building for its long-awaited return in the first week of November. College hoops season is less than three weeks away, but more than 360 teams across the United States have been ramping and tuning up for weeks. We're all just about ready to tip this thing off — and angst grows as we lurch toward Nov. 4. Once the games begin, we can only hope the phantasmagoric will arrive as scheduled — but without a hint of its imminent entry, for maximum impact — as this beautiful mess of a sport is sure to take us on another great journey of joy, shock and madness. Ah, we know it will. We just don't know the when, who, how or why. That's why we love this sport so much. Before we get another college basketball campaign going, let's zoom out and lock in. As has been the case for a decade now, I've foolishly and enthusiastically taken to a master preseason ranking of teams. My methods are uncomplicated but diligent: examine the rosters, check in with coaches for intel, evaluate programs based on recent success (or a lack of it), factor in (and try to discern) inevitable surges and fades, and mostly avoid preseason metrics as to not be influenced by the (often accurate) biases of algorithms. Oh, and: Be sure to just let a few inexplicable predictions rip and hope for the best. A note on this year's process. With the Big Ten and ACC now 18 teams, plus the Big 12 and SEC beefing up to 16 apiece, I found myself wrestling a bit with how to place power-conference teams from about the No. 60 spot and below. Will we see the 79 teams from the power conferences (Big East has 11 and is also in that class) all mostly wind up as top-100 teams in most ratings systems by season's end? Will most of the 79 work their way into the top 70? Is the deck going to prove to be stacked that much in their favor? Or will a dozen-or-so mid-majors break through and find themselves ranked in the top 60? I think that's still possible, and my predictions reflect that, but if it skews toward the big boys in massive ways, I'll take that into consideration a year from now. I want to see how this new world of mass high-major expansion impacts the universe of college hoops, however that winds up playing out. Once more unto the breach, away we go! In what feels like a wide-open season just over the horizon, I'm taking a team at No. 1 with the preseason national player of the year; a team that brought in one of the best transfer classes of the offseason; a team that is adding multiple five-star freshman; and a team that had the No. 2-ranked offense last season en route to the Final Four. Alabama. The Tide are in the rare spot of having the men's basketball band ranked higher in the preseason than the football fellas, just the eighth time that's happened and the first time since 2006. (Bama football was No. 5 in the preseason.) Alabama, of course, is coming off its first Final Four in school history. Now it's going to try to become just the fourth SEC school (joining Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky) to make back-to-back Final Fours. Remember, the Tide was wicked unpredictable on defense last season, but survived in the NCAAs despite that, beating trendy Charleston and 30-win Grand Canyon before upsetting No. 1 UNC and then pushing past Clemson in the Elite Eight. Ultimately, Alabama lost by 14 to UConn in the national semis, which was the Huskies' smallest margin of victory in the NCAAs. Nate Oats did this after losing his entire staff the previous offseason, in addition to the Brandon Miller debacle. Now he's got one of the strongest rosters in the sport, led by CBS Sports Preseason Player of the Year Mark Sears. The inventive lead guard averaged 21.5 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.0 assists. Returning with Sears are two more fifth-year guys: Grant Nelson (11.9 ppg) and Latrell Wrightsell Jr. (8.9 ppg), in addition to promising 6-11 sophomore Jarin Stevenson. Oats picked up notable transfers Chris Youngblood (15.3 ppg at South Florida), Houston Mallette (14.7 ppg at Pepperdine), Clifford Omoruyi (10.4 ppg at Rutgers) and a quisling in former Auburn guard Aden Holloway (7.3 ppg). Oh, and there's also two five-star freshmen in play: power forward Derrion Reid and center Aiden Sherrell. Bama has a loaded nonconference schedule (it plays Purdue, UNC and Houston, all top seeds last March, plus Illinois, Rutgers and Creighton, in addition to hosting a lot of really good mid-majors; it only has six non-con home games, the lowest of any high-major team in the country), so there's a chance the Tide accrues some losses that affect their standing in the human rankings. But I'm expecting this team to be a No. 1 seed and a clear title contender from Game 1. If Sears plays to expectations and the offense remains elite, this will be the best Alabama team in school history. A program that has finished No. 2 at KenPom.com three years running, so let's slot it right there again. Houston's averaged a nation-leading 30.2 wins the past six seasons, amassing 13 NCAA Tournament victories in that span. It hasn't lost more than five league games in a season in that span, including postseason play. The Cougars moved from the American to the Big 12 last season, and not only was there no drop-off whatsoever, the team seemed emboldened by its conference upgrade. A year ago, UH lost a First Team All-American (Marcus Sasser), only to produce another: Jamal Shead. Now Shead is gone (and had he not ripped up his ankle against Duke in the NCAAs, it's all too conceivable Houston would've been at the Final Four in place of NC State). The Cougars' next player in line for All-American status is senior L.J. Cryer, who averaged 15.5 points last season and should show his best yet. The Coogs also bring back proven players Emanuel Sharp (12.6 ppg), J'Wan Roberts (9.5 ppg), Ja'Vier Francis (6.0 ppg) and Joseph Tugler — a key defensive presence whose season ended in February. There's also Terrance Arceneaux, also coming back from injury and whose time surely must be coming. Milos Uzan, via Oklahoma, will be productive in a supporting role that won't require him to be an alpha. Kelvin Sampson's a proven commodity in college hoops. The Big 12 might be the best conference in the sport again, and while Kansas is rightfully getting a lot of No. 1 buzz heading into the season, I'll slightly side in that league with the program whose defense has been more reliable in the past half-decade than any other in college basketball. We're going to see a lot of good three-man cores this season, but Kansas could have the best in the sport: Hunter Dickinson, KJ Adams Jr. and Dajuan Harris Jr. They're all back and each does a variety of things different from the other two that will, again, make Kansas a national title threat. KU was supposed to be that a season ago, but the Jayhawks faced injury issues and withered down the stretch, finishing 27th at KenPom, its all-time low-water mark in that metric's 28-year database. The Jayhawks have reinforcements coming in, and the outlook is optimistic because AJ Storr (Wisconsin), Rylan Griffen (Alabama) and Zeke Mayo (South Dakota State) are all proven scorers AND shooters. Griffen could be near the top of the list of best 3-point snipers if his trajectory translates. KU also has top-20 prospect Flory Bidunga, a center, and four-star guard Rakease Passmore coming in. No Elmarko Jackson, though; he's out for the season with patellar tendon injury he suffered in June. The Jayhawks' biggest problem last season was depth. At one point, Self told me, he seriously debated whether or not to play his five best players together for about 36 out of 40 minutes in a game — and hockey-sub five bench players and try to survive that way. He never did it, but it would have been a fascinating approach. This team, knock on wood, will not need to be kept together with lattice. Dickinson is a preseason First Team All-American in this, his final season of college eligibility. Everything is in place for another great run in Lawrence. Most others in this scenario wouldn't sniff the top 10, solely because of the amount of unproven players that are going to step into new roles and more prominent tasks in Storrs. But UConn is different. Dan Hurley is even more different than different. I've got the Huskies at No. 4 because the program kept Hurley and won the angsty sweepstakes against the Lakers. The coaching staff is still entirely intact, too. And Alex Karaban, a two-time national champion as a starter on both teams, turned down the NBA for one more year in order to chase NCAA history. That's enough to give the Huskies the benefit of the doubt and place them this high heading into the season. Connecticut lost four starters (Tristen Newton, Donovan Clingan, Cam Spencer, Stephon Castle) who'll likely be replaced in the starting lineup by Hassan Diarra, Samson Johnson, Solo Ball and Liam McNeeley. The first three are returnees and McNeeley earned CBS Sports Freshman All-America honors. One guy who's probably going to earn a fair share of starts is Jaylin Stewart. Connecticut also picked up lead guard Aidan Mahaney from Saint Mary's. The two most recent back-to-back champions were Florida in 2007 and Duke in 1992. In the subsequent seasons, Florida went 24-12, made the NIT and was 8-9 vs. SEC opponents. It never reached No. 1 in the AP poll in 2007-08. The 1992-93 Duke team finished 24-8 and went 10-7 vs. ACC opponents. It lost to Cal in the second round of the NCAAs. The Devils spent five weeks at No. 1. Relatedly, we polled 100-plus coaches this summer and asked if they thought UConn would make a third straight Final Four: 68% said no. But the fact 32% said yes is incredible. Hurley is the face of college basketball and one of the most prominent coaches in American sports. He is operating at the peak of his powers, and knowing him, he's obsessed with proving people wrong and is probably sounding klaxons over being put fourth on this list. It will be absurdly difficult to win three national titles in a row. I can't wait to see this version of UConn and how the story plays out over the next five months. Another year, another loaded Duke roster? Yes, but this one includes the most hyped incoming prospect in a generation. Although Zion Williamson became a transcendent sensation, he wasn't expected to be a First Team All-American when he started at Duke; he wasn't even the highest-rated prospect on the team. (RJ Barrett AND Cam Reddish were both ranked above Williamson in 2018.) Now, Cooper Flagg, the CBS Sports Preseason Freshman of the Year, represents Duke's chance to recapture the nation's attention. He could be the best player in the sport … but he's also got a lot around him that may lead to a different reality. Flagg's certainly regarded as the top NBA Draft prospect heading into November. Fortunately, he'll have veterans to acclimate him, most notably junior point guard Tyrese Proctor, sophomore guard Caleb Foster and grad senior Mason Gillis, who comes by way of Purdue, bringing a lot of winning experience with him from West Lafayette, Indiana. Jon Scheyer enters Year 3. The pressure will be significant. He's done a really good job through the first two campaigns, but these next five-to-six months seem destined to feel a lot different. Expectations will be to win the ACC, then get a top-two seed in the NCAAs and to make the Final Four after coming one game short last spring. Proctor has to be more consistent. Flagg's fellow freshmen are all ranked top-30: Isaiah Evans, a lanky 6-foot-7 wing; Khaman Maluach, a 7-1 center from South Sudan who played in the Olympics; Kon Knueppel, a 6-5 shooting guard who might be the skeleton key for this offense; Pat Ngongba (currently dealing with a foot injury), a 6-10 power forward (the idea that he could be the eighth- or ninth-most important player on this team speaks to how loaded Duke is); and Darren Harris, a 6-4 shooting guard who most fan bases would be doing cartwheels over if he was on their roster. Scheyer also has Tulane transfer Sion James (14.0 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 38% from 3-point range), who will get a lot of run. Can Duke win big despite having so much youth, and how much youth will they rely on? The Blue Devils will be a national story every week, and whether you like, love or hate them, that's a good thing for college basketball. For the third straight year, I'm higher on the Bears than just about anyone you'll find. It's working out for me: BU has had a No. 1- or No. 3-seeded résumé the past five years (counting 2020 when that season ended). Scott Drew lost a LOT from last season, and he's also had some coaching turnover on his staff, but until I see true drop-off in Waco I'm not bailing on Baylor as a top-10 program. This year, I've slotted the Bears second in the Big 12 and easily in the Final-Four-contenders discussion. Drew will have to account for losing another lottery pick one-and-done guy (Ja'Kobe Walter) by ... bringing in another lottery pick one-and-done guy (VJ Edgecombe). There is a workable chance Edgecombe winds up leading all freshmen in scoring. He's receiving buzz already for how dynamic his game is. Real star potential. Whether he should or will be tasked with being Baylor's leader is another matter. Langston Love (11.0 ppg) and Jayden Nunn (10.5 ppg) are the two prominent guys back for the Bears. They'll play with Duke transfer Jeremy Roach in the backcourt. Roach has said he wants to be a pure point guard in this Baylor scheme. If that happens and he's an elite decision-maker, then Baylor will be a top-10 team. The Bears also got a crucial transfer in fifth-year player Norchad Omier, who flew up from Miami. Baylor's varying looks will be interesting. I expect a lot of small-ball with Omier at the 5, flanked by Edgecombe at the 4, Langston at 3, Nunn at the 2 and Roach playing the 1. If Omier plays power forward, then junior Josh Ojianwuna will step in at center. Robert Wright III and Jason Asemota are two more fresh bodies (and freshmen) who will see some time. Be patient with the Bears. No high-major team has a tougher first two games. They're playing Gonzaga in GU's backyard on opening night, then facing Arkansas in Dallas five days later. St. John's, UConn and Tennessee (potentially) are also on the schedule. Then it's Big 12 time. Similar to Alabama, this team could be better than its loss total indicates. Lose the best player in school history and stay a top-10 team? That's what great culture and elite coaching will do for you. That's what Purdue has. The only school to win more games over the past three years than Purdue is the one I have ranked at No. 2. The Big Ten — now a ridiculous, nobody-asked-for-this 18-school union — feels as hodgepodge as ever. But I'll take the Boilermakers to emerge at the top again. Three starters are back, the most important being Braden Smith, who could become a top-three point guard if this offense regenerates properly, Doctor Who-style, without Zach Edey. Purdue, in total, has 46% of its scoring back from last season's team that made it to the national championship. Look for Trey Kaufman-Renn to be THE breakout player in the Big Ten. In two seasons he's averaged 4.5 and 6.4 points. That number should double, minimally. Caleb Furst is also likely to bust from his shell. But this is Purdue, so let's talk centers. Who are the new towers in play? There's Daniel Jacobsen (7-4) and Will Berg (7-2). The Jesse Pinkman memes about Painter continually recruiting alien-sized players will continue apace once the games get going. Purdue has rostered a 7-footer 13 years in a row which, for all we know, is an all-time NCAA record. (If you know of a school that's had a 7-footer for 14 straight seasons, please find me.) Here's an intriguing note from Purdue: The team brings back 60% of its starting minutes from a season ago. Why does that matter? This is the 11th time under Painter that Purdue has brought back that much year-over-year. The eight most recent times Purdue brought back "at least 110 starts" from the year before, Purdue made the Sweet 16 in six of those seasons. Its winning percentage in those eight seasons: .789. That's really, really good. And given the growth of Smith and Fletcher Loyer, it should signal stability in the foggiest power conference in college basketball. Purdue has 113 league wins the past eight seasons. No high-major team claims more. Its Big Ten reign will continue by winning a fifth conference title in a nine-year span. The Volunteers had the second-best player in college basketball last season. Dalton Knecht will go down as one of the best up-transfers in college hoops history. From Northern Colorado to SEC POY. And Tennessee made a fun run to the Elite Eight before losing to the best player in college basketball. Rick Barnes not only lost Knecht, but also Jonas Aidoo, Josiah-Jordan James, Santiago Vescovi and Tobe Awaka. It's a lot! Maybe Tennessee suffers a plummet and proves to be, like, the eighth-best team in the SEC. But I'm gonna zag on that theory. I'll stick with the Barnes formula and register UT as the No. 2 team in the league. Critically, Zakai Zeigler's leadership at point guard is still in play in Knoxville. Zeigler can be a top-20 player nationally, buttressed by the fact that he's probably a top-10 defensive guard (at 5-8, no less). Zeigler's going to be at his best physically this season, and he'll pair in the backcourt with a North Florida transfer who hopes to be the next Knecht. His name is Chaz Lanier and he shot 44% from 3-point range last season while averaging 19.7 points. I like him to easily average double digits in the SEC. Barnes also brought on Felix Okpara from Ohio State, a quick-twitch center who could threaten to average three blocks and is a major reason why Tennessee will still be regarded as an SEC contender. I like sophomore J.P. Estrella to have a breakout season. Unclear whether he'll start in November, but I wouldn't be surprised in the least if he was hearing his name called in pregame by February. Due to the SEC's depth, accurately predicting even the 1-5 order of this league will be near-impossible. But until I see Tennessee significantly drop under Barnes, the Vols (as a regular-season operation) deserve the benefit of every doubt. Mark Few is feeling revitalized. He's coming off his time with Team USA at the Olympics, where he served as an assistant on the gold-medal winning team. It'd be no shock if Few picked up a few extra tricks from Steve Kerr and deployed some fun stuff in his offense in the months forthcoming. The Bulldogs are dinged slightly by the unfortunate loss — for the second year in a row — of small forward Steele Venters. The Eastern Washington transfer suffered an Achilles tear less than a year after rupturing an ACL. He figured to be a double-digit scorer. This being Gonzaga, I still think the Bulldogs find a way to have one of the best offenses in the sport for the ninth straight season. Graham Ike (16.5 ppg) will probably have the best season of his career; the timing is great considering this is his last one. Same goes for Ryan Nembhard, a fringe preseason All-America candidate who could threaten to average 15 points and 7 assists. Gonzaga has 81.4% of its minutes back from 2023-24, seventh-most in the country, according to BartTorvik.com. The only high-major program bringing back more is Notre Dame, per Torvik, and the only other two in the top 25 in terms of power-conference programs are Houston and Marquette. In bringing back more than 80% of the team's minutes, continuity should provide an easy transition and a likely 18th straight season with 25-plus wins. Guys like Nolan Hickman, Ben Gregg and Dusty Stromer should all play increased roles, while Pepperdine transfer Michael Ajayi (absolute hooper) and Arkansas import Khalif Battle (on his fourth school in four years, no less) reinforce GU's firepower and experience factor. The question is: Have we seen Gonzaga at its best, or does Few have another Final Four-level team in him? This one seems to have a shot. Fortunately, we don't have to wait to see the goods. The Zags play Baylor on opening night, thankfully giving college hoops a true marquee matchup to tip off the season. There's split opinion on how viable North Carolina is after losing one of the most productive players in school history, Armando Bacot, in addition to saying goodbye to double-digit scorers Harrison Ingram and Cormac Ryan. The most important player was RJ Davis, and lucky for UNC, the First Team All-American is using his COVID year for one last dance. Asking Davis (21.2 ppg) to recreate his impact from his senior season will be tough, but he might not have to in order to keep North Carolina in the top two in the ACC. Davis has company in the backcourt with familiar teammates Elliot Cadeau (expect a much better player this season), Seth Trimble and Jae'Lyn Withers coming back to Chapel Hill. Belmont transfer Cade Tyson (16.2 ppg) brings shooting reinforcements, while Vanderbilt big Ven-Allen Lubin is going to play with Jalen Washington to hopefully keep UNC's frontcourt somewhat respectable. UNC's lack of interior presence is the elephant in the room when we discuss the Heels' chances of being a national title contender. Ironically, I'm in on Carolina as a top-10 team because of its top two freshmen. It's counterintuitive in this final year of the bonus COVID year to think that 18-year-olds could be linchpin-type players, but that is setting up as the case here. Ian Jackson was ranked No. 8 in his class. The 6-5 2-guard from the Bronx could be a streaky shooter, but he's going to be a lot of fun as a potential sometimes-starter. Drake Powell (No. 11 in the class of 2024) is a guy I can't wait to watch. Powell's a strong wing, someone who could prove to be a high-level defender right away. It wouldn't surprise me if those two wound up being top-10 freshmen. UNC fell short of a second Final Four in three years under Hubert Davis, despite being a No. 1 seed, thanks to slamming into high-octane Alabama. Asking this group to build top-20 formats in offensive and defensive efficiency (which seems plausible as far as I'm concerned) should equate to Carolina again being in the Final Four mix. Things get going early: Nov. 8 at Kansas is a wonderful matchup in the first week of the season. Then UNC will test itself in Maui in that loaded field before eventually facing the likes of Alabama, Florida and UCLA in December. This team is going to take losses but will solidify itself to tussle with Duke atop the ACC. Let's just buy the ticket and take the ride. This is admittedly an aggressive spot for the Johnnies, who are coming off the shocking non-inclusion to the NCAAs. Not just that — St. John's wasn't even in the first four out after giving UConn its closest game in all of March and April. The Red Storm went 20-13 with a 4-10 record in Quad 1 and 3-1 in Quad 3. It wasn't enough. Now it needs to be better than an 11-9 team in the Big East that's sitting in fifth. I think it clears that bar with ease in '24-25. Rick Pitino is going to be a mad scientist making sure this team is nowhere near the bubble, despite the departures of Daniss Jenkins, Joel Soriano, Jordan Dingle, Chris Leldum and Nahiem Alleyne. They merely combined to average more than 57 points per game no biggie. My favorite conspiracy theory is Pitino went to Kentucky's Big Blue Madness and donned a UK sweater, whipping up multiple fan bases into a tizzy, knowing all the while he's got a team that's going to kill it this season. So, who's stepping up? RJ Luis (10.9 ppg) is the most important returnee, though I'd bank on Simeon Wilcher (2.8 ppg) quadrupling his scoring output in his sophomore season. He was a good team player, but now it's time to embrace a much more prominent role. Not as prominent as Kadary Richmond, who crossed enemy lines and made the switch from Seton Hall to SJU. Richmond will be on the short list of preseason Big East player of the year honors after averaging nearly 16 points at the Hall and scoring more than 1,200 points in his career. I think he's a dark horse choice for NPOY, too. Richmond will be set up by a great portal get in Deivon Smith, who averaged 13.3 points, 7.1 assists and 6.3 rebounds at Utah. Just a huge add there. Another key name is Vincent Iwuchukwu, who could benefit from a change in scenery after giving it an honest go the past two seasons at USC, following his heart scare in the summer of 2022. Look for Iwuchukwu to back up Zuby Ejiofor at the 5 and for North Texas 4-man Aaron Scott to be the first player off the bench. I love the talent blend and obviously trust the coaching. This could be UConn's biggest challenger in the Big East, and after last March's fireworks at MSG, who doesn't want to see more of that? Longtime readers know (and love?) my penchant for taking a few big swings every year in my top 25. Similar to St. John's, I am all the way in on Wake Forest: Top 15 Team. I'm just as in on the idea that lead guard Hunter Sallis will become a First Team All-American after bypassing the NBA Draft. Sallis averaged 18.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists and shot 40.5% from 3 last season. He's the latest transfer to downright thrive in Steve Forbes' system. Did Forbes land his transfers based on his reputation for being a portal whisperer? "Oh, without question — because they were offered way more money by other people," Forbes told me last season. "You have to have some (NIL), you can't just come in here empty handed. But, Hunter made a business decision. He did his homework." Sallis' jolt of confidence has Wake Forest's fanbase feeling more beatific heading into a November than it's been in a decade-plus. Sallis is super-receptive to coaching, has an insatiable work ethic and everyone in the program follows his lead. This year, Sallis carries Wake into the upper echelon of the ACC and gets the Deacs to the NCAAs, snapping the school's eight-year drought. He returns alongside another key Deacon, Efton Reid. If Reid can avoid foul trouble, he could emerge as one of the best bigs in the conference. Cameron Hildreth is also back in the starting lineup, effectively playing a third guard. The point? That will be Ty-Laur Johnson (Louisville), but given this is Wake, new bodies abound. App State transfer Tre'Von Spillers will play the 4, while Omaha Biliew (Iowa State) and Davin Cosby (Alabama) will also be getting plenty of run in their new surroundings. When Wake Forest is wrecking teams, remember who was first aboard the ship. Like pretty much every Marquette fan, I'm a convert to the notion that Shaka Smart is in the perfect place for what he wants to achieve in his career. The Golden Eagles are averaging 25 wins per season through Smart's first three years. I think they hit that number in Year 4 … but I also must draw attention to the reality that this will be Smart's first season at MU without Tyler Kolek in the locker room. His leadership and presence helped cement the foundation for Smart's vision of a reborn Marquette program. Now Kolek's off in the NBA and soon to be playing in a building he once won a championship in: Madison Square Garden. The Golden Eagles should still be one of the Big East's best because they do in fact return their leading scorer. Kam Jones and his 17.2 points per game are still here, flanked in the backcourt by Stevie Mitchell and Chase Ross. Underestimate that troika at your own peril. Forward David Joplin is also back, and yeah this is the place where I remind you that Smart opted not to bring in a transfer yet again. He's making it work. Against the rip tides of the sport, Smart is pulling this off. (Big man Ben Gold is about to have a breakout season as well, you can practically smell it.) If this prediction proves correct and Marquette winds up with a No. 4 seed or better for the third straight season, Smart's going to be able to charge outrageous public appearance rates to speak at coaching clinics across the country. They've got something really strong going, and with nearly 73% of the team's minutes still here from a season ago, it's more than fair to give this lot the benefit of the doubt following two seasons in which they finished 13th and 10th at KenPom. After three seasons and 88 wins in the Pac-12, Tommy Lloyd now takes his high-octane offense into the Big 12. The Wildcats figure to be one of the five best teams in that outstanding conference — something reflected in the preseason AP Top 25, where Arizona ranked fifth among Big 12 teams but was still ranked 10th. (Damn.) It's practically unheard of to have five returning All-Americans in college basketball in this generation, but that's what we're getting. One of those five is the final Pac-12 (As We Knew It) Player of the Year: Caleb Love. He's back for one more season, which means Arizona will be irresistible to watch. Love had some really good moments last season, in addition to the expected dose of Anything Could Happen On This Possession (Watch Out!). Also returning: Jaden Bradley (love his defense; crazy underrated player) and KJ Lewis (big breakout potential as a sophomore). Those three will be Arizona's backcourt, and they'll start alongside 7-2 sophomore Motiejus Krivas and Horizon League POY Trey Townsend, who helped Oakland to that charmed Cinderella run. Lloyd should get some frontcourt insurance from Tobe Awaka, who arrives after playing for Tennessee. Reports out of Tucson also indicate Anthony Dell'orso and Henri Veesaar have been absolute studs, with freshman Carter Bryant exceeding expectations, too. It will be enticing to see how this team adapts to the Big 12. Is Arizona going to come in and be as good in its first year the way Houston was last season? That wouldn't be a shock, but I'm going to stop short of that. I like a team in the 3-5 seed range that yet again will rank near the top of the most watchable offenses in choops. This is going to feel refreshing for everyone. John Calipari's time at UK needed to end. He did a lot of great things there, but the program was aching for a reboot. In comes affable alum Mark Pope, and what a flip this has been. Big Blue Nation went from despondent to delirious over the course of 48 hours after his hiring became public, a fan reaction reversion the likes of which I can't ever recall. So, how will the Wildcats look under new management? Pope has seemingly assembled a 10-deep roster without holding on to a single player who was in uniform in Lexington last season. My best guess at the opening day starting five: Kerr Kriisa (WVU transfer), Lamont Butler (SDSU transfer), Andrew Carr (Wake Forest transfer), Jaxson Robinson (BYU transfer) and Amari Williams (Drexel transfer). Those five combined to average 60 points last season. First off the bench figures to be 3-point specialist Koby Brea, who might even play his way into the starting role. Brea's commitment to UK solidified this roster's validity as top 25-quality. Pope also has Ansley Almonor (16.4 ppg at Fairleigh Dickinson), Otega Oweh (11.4 ppg at Oklahoma) and Brandon Garrison (7.5 ppg at Oklahoma State), with Garrison's long-term potential being a building block for the Pope era. Freshmen Collin Chandler, Travis Perry and Trent Noah will give the UK staff a deployment that's deeper than just about any roster Calipari had at Kentucky. (Notice I didn't write "more talented.") With games against Duke, Gonzaga, at Clemson and vs. Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic, the Wildcats will be tested regularly. I can't wait to see how this behemoth of a program is reborn with a vastly different personality calling the shots. I got to spend an afternoon this spring at UCLA, and one of the big takeaways for the year ahead was how connected and mature the group was in Westwood. Mick Cronin needed this, you'll recall, because he was as vocally critical of his team as any coach last season. (To the point where some in college basketball wondered if he was looking for a way out. UCLA went 16-17 and was a huge letdown. Cronin had never been so out of answers.) Turns out, things weren't so bad as to have a roster revolt. Three players that combined to average 37 points last season are back: point guard Dylan Andrews, shooting guard Sebastian Mack and small forward Lazar Stefanovic. UCLA is also bringing back the 7-3 Aday Mara who, with Zach Edey gone, will be among the tallest players in the sport. There's more, of course. UCLA actually had NIL resources during this past cycle, so expect Cronin to go 10-deep thanks to bringing on five transfers that averaged double-digit scoring, led by Tyler Bilodeau (14.3 ppg at Oregon State) and Dominick Harris (14.3 ppg at Loyola Marymount). From 2020-23, Cronin had offenses that ranked 11th, 12th and 21st in efficiency at KenPom. Last season it cratered to 152. I'd be shocked if this group didn't at least get into the top 40 and with a team that is more 3-point reliant than any of Cronin's previous squads at UCLA. There might be some small sacrifice on the defensive end (which Cronin will understandably resist), but it's a worthwhile trade-off to get UCLA back into the top-25 conversation. I'm bullish on the Bruins in their first year in the Big Ten. The Bluejays clear a preseason top-20 designation thanks to getting resolute big man Ryan Kalkbrenner back for a fifth and final season. Kalkbrenner is the early automatic frontrunner for Big East defensive player of the year, which doubles in selling him as a top-five defender in the sport. (He's won DPOY in the Big East three years running and will tie Patrick Ewing's mark of four in a row if he does it again.) Big Kalk averaged 17.3 points, 7.6 rebounds and 3.1 blocks for a borderline top-10 team. It won't be easy, but mark me down for it: He betters all of those numbers in '24-25. Fortunately, Kalk is back with Mason Miller and Steven Ashworth also returning to the fold. That's critical in Creighton's quest to capture top-three status in the Big East for a sixth time in a seven-year stretch. It won't be easy due to the losses of Baylor Scheierman and Trey Alexander, both of whom are now in the NBA. And I wonder about CU's depth. The big portal get was Pop Isaacs, who averaged 15.8 points in a clattering season at Texas Tech. Isaac Traudt should be a growth prospect as a movable 4-man in Greg McDermott's system. Every year we get a handful of teams that are capable of only playing seven guys yet maintain nationally ranked status. I think the Jays are going to clear that bar, extending one more year in what's unequivocally been the best stretch of success in program history. Switching from Juwan Howard to Dusty May is going to be a near-180 culture overturn in Ann Arbor. Howard ultimately closed himself off to too many people and became too stubborn in trying to run a program. It redounded negatively on him to the point where AD Warde Manuel was effectively forced to go back on his word and fired Howard in March. In comes May, who won 126 games and averaged 21 wins in his six seasons at Florida Atlantic, which is outstanding considering the embarrassing lack of history and resources he embraced when he got that job in 2018. Michigan won out over Louisville and Vanderbilt for May's services, and I'm ranking U-M higher than just about anyone because the transfer haul feels like an ideal combo of size, shooting, speed, athleticism and proven commodities. Only one player followed May from FAU: center Vlad Goldin. He'll play alongside Yale transfer Danny Wolf, who could wind up as one of the five best up-transfers in college hoops … if Goldin doesn't rank ahead of him. Wolf can play the 3, 4 or 5 and is an A-level passer, screen-setter and space eater on the interior. Michigan also landed the underrated Sam Walters from Alabama, entering-his-prime Roddy Gayle Jr. from Ohio State, two-way competitor Rubin Jones from North Texas and sneaky-good 3-point contributor Tre Donaldson from Auburn. EvanMiya.com ranks Michigan's transfer class No. 5, which I might argue is too low. Scottie Pippen's son Justin is a freshman on this team, and the return of shooting guard Nimari Burnett and combo forward Will Tschetter should give May what he had at FAU: a roster that reliably is 10-deep and full of basketball-obsessed team players. I'm always good (or bad) for a smattering of zesty prognostications, so here's another. Boise State winning the Mountain West and becoming a top-20 crew feels as thrilling of a preseason call as almost any I've got listed. Leon Rice is over the moon at having a point guard who's his ideal kind of floor general. His name is Alvaro Cardenas. He was an intra-conference foil for Rice; Cardenas played for Tim Miles at San Jose State and averaged 13.2 points, 5.5 assists and shot 39% from 3-point territory. And he should be the key to unlock Boise State's latest NCAA Tournament team — and its first NCAA Tournament win in school history? We'll see. No program has made more Big Dances without a victory than the Broncos (0-10). BSU's best player is Tyson Degenhart. One of many instances where a high-major player is playing for a team outside the power-conference structure. Degenhart, a 6-8 senior, is the most practical preseason pick for MW POY. He might average 20/night on his way to becoming an NBA pick in 2025. Degenhart will again suit up alongside O'Mar Stanley, an undersized 5 who nevertheless played his way onto the all-league second team last season. On first glance, Boise State's roster doesn't shout "best in the Mountain West," but the buy-in at point guard and the physicality and versatility in the frontcourt has me believing in the Broncos. How big of a step back was last season? Consider that Indiana State finished 38th at KenPom, while IU was all the way at 91 and well out of the NCAA Tournament conversation. Despite making the Big Dance in years 1 and 2, Mike Woodson enters Year 4 on uneasy ground after the frustrations that sprouted like weeds emerged a season ago. The Hoosiers shouldn't even entertain outcomes that threaten Woodson's job security, though, not with the roster he's put together. IU brings back a 15-point-per-game guy in Malik Reneau (15.4 ppg), a 10.6 point-per-game vet in Trey Galloway, plus a likely sophomore burst from Mackenzie Mgbako (12.2 ppg). The Hoosiers, operating with a healthy NIL budget, also recruited Oumar Ballo from Arizona and Myles Rice from Washington State (two top-100 players), in addition to some others, like Kanaan Carlyle, who I'm eager to see in new surroundings after a nondescript season at Stanford. The 3-point shooting (or lack thereof) is a glaring concern, but most everything else screams top-20 roster. Can IU do it? Can it finish as a top-25 team for the first time in almost a decade? I can't shake the feeling this is going to be a noisy season (and that can be a good thing in many respects) for Woodson's program. One major letdown is the nonconference schedule, which is sorely lacking in must-see matchups. It also will give Indiana a lot less slack come conference play if IU falls short of winning the Battle 4 Atlantis. The Cyclones were unquestionably a top-10 team last season. The defense rated No. 1 at KenPom. The Clones destroyed inferior opponents on the regular and deserved a top seed instead of the No. 2 they got on Selection Sunday. That said, as I do every year (to varying results, yes!), I have to fade some teams in order to heavily buy in on some others in against-the-grain fashion. Mark me down for having ISU scootch back a bit in the bloated, beastly Big 12. The starting five will be led by one of the best guards in the country, Tamin Lipsey, who should be much more respected and discussed — to the level he deserves — by the time we get to Christmas. Lipsey will be flanked in the backcourt by senior Keshon Gilbert, who led the team in usage last season and probably will again this year. T.J. Otzelberger also brings back one of the more promising sophomores in the Big 12, Milan Momcilovic, who will play the 3. In the frontcourt, Saint Mary's transfer Joshua Jefferson and Charlotte newcomer Dishon Jackson will likely be starters. I'm wondering about the reliability up front, which is why I've opted to slightly sell on ISU's outlook. Overall, there's little question about this team's NCAA chances and its defensive pedigree. They can win ugly, but few care about style when the Ws rack up. This school should be dancing for the fourth straight year which would mark only the second time in program history that's happened. 10, 23, 14, 4, 8, 6, 6, 20. That's the final KenPom ranking for the No. 2 Big Ten over the past eight seasons. Illinois might be No. 2 this season, but it has been No. 2 (and sometimes No. 1) in the Big Ten over the past five seasons. Brad Underwood has a program humming, and that's a fact because he's made a habit of losing all-league guys and not falling too far behind. He'll carry on without Terrence Shannon Jr., Coleman Hawkins, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, Dain Dainja and Luke Goode. That's tons to overcome, but I have faith he'll do it thanks to some stars in the making that should find new life in Champaign. It will start with a guy I've been told has been insanely good in practice: freshman lead guard Kasparas Jakucionis. The Lithuanian could be a 2025 lottery pick. He'll join forces with Kylan Boswell, who averaged 9.6 points and 3.6 assists in a hot-and-cold two-year run with Arizona. Those two are the key, and they'll have help from Ty Rodgers and Dra Gibbs-Lawhorn, both of whom need to emerge as more consistent contributors. Carey Booth is a fledgling talent who couldn't get it going at Notre Dame. I like his chances to be a solid piece off the bench. Underwood also will bank on Ben Humrichous (14.7 ppg at Evansville) and Tre White (12.3 with Louisville) being minutes-eaters alongside two top-30 freshmen in 3-man Will Riley and 5 Morez Johnson. Illinois can be both the surprise and the reliable, pragmatic choice as a top-four finisher in the Big Ten. The tempting sleeper in the SEC. Todd Golden's Gators return three players (Walter Clayton Jr. and Will Richard in the backcourt, Alex Condon as a big) who averaged 20-plus minutes last season. They'll all be starters alongside transfers Alijah Martin (FAU) and, most likely, Rueben Chinyelu (Washington State). Martin committing to UF was a big-time add; he's an opportunistic scorer and is going to be one of the best man-to-man defenders in the SEC. With his Final Four pedigree, Martin figures to rise Florida's floor. Sophomore forward Thomas Haugh has also made huge strides in the offseason and will be the sixth man at worst. Clayton's savvy playmaking ability will likely lead to him being a top-four lead guard in the SEC. He's high-IQ, no doubt, and now the goal is to perk his 3-point accuracy from 36% and change to that ever-coveted 40% threshold. The Gators haven't yet returned to that upper-echelon SEC program that they could claim for a good portion of Billy Donovan's time, but Golden has the temperament and intellect to get there. Surprising though it may seem, Kansas State is now one of the biggest players in the transfer market. That was proven when Jerome Tang's program landed what's acknowledged as the most expensive portal get of 2024: Coleman Hawkins. The price? North of $2 million. The longtime Illinois stretch 4 will need to be one of the 20-or-so best players in American to both validate his NIL tag and lift K-State to top-25 status. I believe he will, and that's why I have the Wildcats ranked accordingly. Tang also brought on Achor Achor from Samford, Dug McDaniel from Michigan, Ugonna Onyenso from Kentucky and Max Jones from Cal State Fullerton, where he quietly/reliably averaged 15.3 points. Villanova transfer Brendan Hausen also will play north of 20 minutes per night. It's a big roster changeover, one of the starkest of any Power Five program that didn't undergo a coaching flip in '24. Tang was heavily courted by Arkansas but turned down the Razorbacks. He's where he wants to be and no question has the talent to get back to the Big Dance after missing out last year. Who amongst us can't wait to see John Calipari's final phase in Fayetteville? The Razorbacks' new coach returns just one player from the Eric Musselman regime, but he's a key one: Trevon Brazile. The stretchy 4-man opted to stick around for a rebuild that has some attention-grabbing parts. DJ Wagner followed Calipari from Kentucky, as did Adou Thiero and Zvonimir Ivišić. The latter two will be complementary pieces who could shine from time to time, but it's Wagner that seems to be the key. He took a backseat last season, despite starting, because of the dazzling play from Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham. Those two are now in the NBA. Wagner hopes to be there a year from now, but the thing is, his style is close to Johnell Davis, who was an 18.2 ppg guy at FAU last season and is also on the Hogs' roster. That duo needs to learn to play off each other to give Arkansas a shot at landing in the top four of the SEC. And that's before taking into account that freshman Boogie Fland is also going to want the ball in his hands. Fland arrives alongside Karter Knox and Billy Richmond, all three switching allegiances from Kentucky shortly after Calipari fled for Hog heaven. Defensively, the Razorbacks will be viable for one man above all others: Jonas Aidoo. The Tennessee transfer averaged 11.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and was subsequently feverishly recruited in the portal. The class ranked No. 6 in the sport, per EvanMiya.com. To the shock of nobody, Calipari has recruited an enviable cluster of talent. He will have to embrace some late-career reinventions in order to dodge the flare-up of disappointments that became toxic in Lexington. Whether he's capable remains to be seen. But given who he convinced to follow him to Arkansas, this team has no excuse not to be one of the 30 best in college hoops. The last time MSU had a seed better than No. 7 was 2019 (though it would have been either a No. 2 or No. 3 in 2020). We're waiting on the return of vintage Michigan State. Will it happen in 2025? How many years does Tom Izzo still want to do this? Two more? Five? Whatever it is, I do expect Sparty to qualify for a 27th straight NCAA Tournament and for this team to be embedded in the strong and deep second tier in the Big Ten. A lot of pieces return from a 20-15 squad that ranked top-20 at KenPom. In fact, MSU is pretty well-stocked, considering Tyson Walker, Malik Hall, A.J. Hoggard and Mady Sissoko are all gone. Jeremy Fears, Jaden Akins (he's the key) and Tre Holloman all return and will combo for a three-headed backcourt that I'd like to see push the issue a lot more than last season's unhurried scheme. In the frontcourt, Coen Carr and Xavier Booker ready for their sophomore close-ups, and it sounds like Jaxon Kohler's role should spike. The roster looks like one breakout candidate after another. Plus, a family tree has been planted. Jase Richardson, a freshman, is the son of a guy who carries a pretty great legacy in East Lansing: Jason Richardson. Good group. Given it's Izzo, I openly admit to the very real possibility that I've under-ranked his group, I just want to see it come together before putting MSU into the top 25. The best news here is Johni Broome has a real chance to challenge a rival player on a rival team, Alabama's Mark Sears, for SEC Player of the Year. Broome averaged 16.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 2.2 apg, 2.2 bpg and was a 55% shooter for a 27-win Auburn team that finished (HELLO!) fourth at KenPom. Yes: fourth — despite losing to Yale in the first round — the best finish in school history, even if the Big Dance result didn't correlate. (Nugget: 2018 Virginia and 2016 Michigan State are the only other teams to ever lose in the first round and finish top-five at KenPom.) Now Bruce Pearl has a group with sites set again on winning the SEC, though as you can see I'm a seller on that idea. Every year there are a few teams ranked in the preseason that prove to be overshots, and I'll take a chance Auburn applies here. I already know the tut-tutting from Auburn fans is going to follow me well into the season. I've accepted it. For reasons hard to foresee, some teams just take steps back. Chad Baker-Mazara and Denver Jones return, and those two should be double-digit scorers alongside Broome. Furman's JP Pegues, who dropped 18.4 a night last season, will also squeeze in here as a viable option in Pearl's offense. The transfer class isn't great, though: EvanMiya ranks this class 70th in the country and second-worst in the SEC, a league so stacked that surprise results are unavoidable. And given how good Auburn's schedule is (Houston, the Maui Invitational, Duke, Ohio State, Purdue; it's loaded) in the noncon, it's going to take on some losses before what I think will be one of the toughest SEC slates in the conference. Sean Miller instantly steered Xavier back toward its typical realm of success in his first season (a No. 3 seed and a Sweet 16 run), but last year was a humbling downgrade. X went 16-18 and battled health issues en route to a forgettable campaign. For Year 3, the Musketeers have some dark-horse potential in the Big East, even despite the loss of starting center Lassina Traore, who is already done for the year with a knee injury. However, Zach Freemantle will be 24 years old and get a fully healthy final season, which should lead to him being among the best bigs in the Big East. Freemantle is, essentially, a returning starter. The only other player that's true of is Dayvion McKnight. The fifth-year senior averaged 12.4 points, 4.8 assists, 3.7 rebounds and shot 37.2% on his 3s. Because Xavier was a non-factor, McKnight was probably one of the most underrated players in the Big East. He'll shine. The Musketeers brought in Indiana State transfer Ryan Conwell, who could be Souley Boum-esque in terms of his impact. Excellent shot-taker who averaged nearly 17 points for a witty Sycamores squad last season. Toledo transfer Dante Maddox Jr. is also in line to start, given his numbers last season (15.6 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 40.2 3-pt%). Given Miller's coaching acumen and the fact there are 10 players on this roster who are juniors, seniors or fifth-year players, it would be a semi-stunner if X wasn't easily in the NCAAs. It's wild times at Memphis these days, which is to say: everything's normal. Penny Hardaway's program is under NCAA investigation again, it's unclear what said investigation will lead to, and it's undetermined if Hardaway's actually on the hot seat or not. He made unusual late-offseason staff changes. The Tigers missed the NCAAs in March. Fan engagement is spotty, due in part to school administrators passing on an opportunity to leave the American for the Pac-12. (For now?) This is not a well-run outfit at present. But what about the basketball players? With Houston out of the conference, Memphis is the king of the league and is my pick to be the AAC's best — despite losing five key pieces. Hardaway's most important add would seem to be Tyrese Hunter, the former Iowa State and Texas point guard who is a reliable jump shot and two inches away from being an NBA Draft pick. He's going to team up with Tulsa transfer and top-shelf scorer PJ Haggerty. The frontcourt will feature a familiar name: Moussa Cisse is boomeranging back to the Tigers for his final season; he's a great rim protector and should help with Memphis' signature defensive edge. Dain Dainja comes by way of Illinois. I think he's a great get. The champion of the American should be a top-30 team. Based on talent, Memphis is the logical pick. The Bearcats will break through in Year 4 of Wes Miller's regime and make the NCAAs, ending a drought that dates back to 2019. Miller's team finished 39th at KenPom last season; a noticeable bump up is in order yet again. UC fans' patience will be rewarded. Miller has the benefit of returning enough above-average pieces to be a feisty team in the thick Big 12. There is no outright star here, but then again, that's the Cincinnati way more often than not. Jizzle James' breakout sophomore season is an expectation; the physical combo guard needs to make a jump to justify this ranking. But bringing back Day Day Thomas and Dan Skillings Jr. in the backcourt is just as important for the objectives in Cincy. Their style contrasted against Aziz Bandaogo's standout defense — he will be featured in the middle — is going to give the Bearcats some matchup advantages. Bandaogo will be assisted by Simas Lukosius, who can roam on the wing as one of the more dependable 6-8 3-point shooters in the league. The intriguing name is Dillon Mitchell, who is using his last year of eligibility and figures to start at the 4. BYU was the surprise metrics darling in the Big 12 last season. I sense UC could be that team in '24-25. Some might have expected the Red Raiders to drift into obscurity after the short-lived, disastrous end to the Mark Adams era. Not at all. Grant McCasland was the right guy at the right time. TTU went 23-11 and got a 6-seed in 2024 — doing so with an offense-first philosophy. It should be in that ballpark again in 2025. Two critical transfers to know: PG Elijah Hawkins (Minnesota) and JT Toppin (New Mexico). Hawkins was one of the best pure distributors in college hoops as a Gopher. Toppin is a bouncy wing that does a little bit of everything and broke Lobo hearts when he left ABQ. Adding those two in with three guys back (Darrion Williams, Chance McMillian, Kerwin Walton) who combined to average 30-plus points gives the Red Raiders a sleeper's chance at being a Big 12 contender. Devan Cambridge is also back, and on his way to being healthy. A lot of promise with this team. The Wahoos have made all but two NCAA tourneys since 2012, and I'm confident that broad track of success continues in 2025. But it's time for UVa to get back to making its mark in March; the program's last Big Dance victory was against Texas Tech in the 2019 title game. Last season, Virginia was a no-show vs. Colorado State in the First Four. Losing Ryan Dunn and Reece Beekman early to the NBA (borderline priceless defenders) drops the Cavs' ceiling and essentially forces them out of top-25 consideration heading into November. Tony Bennett brings back shooting guard Isaac McKneely and his reassuring 44.5% 3-point accuracy. Big man Blake Buchanan is situated for a breakout year and he's not going to be the only one in Charlottesville. The portal add who could be requisite to Virginia finishing in the top five of the ACC is a guy who was in the league last season, but barely made a mark. TJ Power opted out of Duke, knowing full well just how much talent was coming in. At Virginia he can become one of the breakout sophomores, provided he's bought into Bennett's defensive requirements. Anthony Grant is 135-55 in his last six seasons at UD, equating to a magnificent .711 winning percentage, the best in the Atlantic 10 in that span and one of the 15 best of any men's Division I coach. It's for that reason, above all others, that I will again forecast Dayton as the best team in the conference. The Flyers are the most consistent team in that league. There are some lowered expectations because of the loss of DaRon Holmes II, but UD fans have seen their team overcome significant losses of NBA-level talent before. Thankfully, Malachi Smith's return from injury should inject renewed optimism in Dayton, going along with the return of preseason A-10 first-teamer Nate Santos. Santos, Enoch Cheeks and Javon Bennett are the support columns, but it's the transfers that make me all in on Dayton's return to the Big Dance. (UD is coming off an NCAA appearance as a No. 7 seed, which included a win over Nevada in the first round.) The Flyers brought in former Ohio State big man Zed Key and well-traveled defensive specialist Posh Alexander, who are both old enough to be voting in a second presidential election. How a coach schedules tells me how confident he is in his team. UD is not only going to Maui, but Grant also has Marquette, UNLV, Cincinnati and Northwestern on the schedule. These guys might not be as good as last season, but I think they'll be relatively close. What encore is in store for the team that made its first Elite Eight in 44 years? The Tigers have a healthy chance at a fifth NCAA Tournament push under Brad Brownell (and it would be the first time ever under him that Clemson made back-to-back Big Dances) with the return of Chase Hunter at combo guard and power forward Ian Schieffelin. Had PJ Hall come back, Clemson would have easily been a preseason AP Top 25 team. Without him, they'll look to make up some ground and can get their bona fides on defense with Cincinnati transfer Viktor Lakhin. The Tigers will rely on Jaeden Zackery (11.2 ppg, 4.3 apg at Boston College) to be the primary 1-man. If he's efficient, Clemson can hope to be in the realm of last season's 117.7 adjusted offensive efficiency rating (per KenPom), a program-best number. I think the Tigers are a moving target in the ACC but am willing to give Brownell the benefit of the doubt and buy in on continued success and a top-five league finish for the fourth time in five seasons.. Randy Bennett's Gaels have won 26 or 27 games in four of the past five seasons, with the COVID-affected 2020-21 campaign being the exception. It's fair to brace for a little step back here, as Aidan Mahaney left for UConn and Alex Ducas graduated. Josh Jefferson also decided to portal it out of there. I love that Mitchell Saxen is here again for a fifth and final season, though. I'd rank him among the 15 best bigs in the sport. With Saxen and the 7-1 Harry Wessels making life hell in the paint, Saint Mary's is again going to be rugged and not to be trifled with on defense. And sure, the Aussie pipeline is still flowing into Moraga, California, but Bennett's also added a couple of Lithuanians to boot. Had Mahaney stayed it would've benefited the program, but SMC fans know that Augustas Marciulionis was the team's better floor general anyway. He's back for a senior season on a squad that is again going to firmly be No. 2 in the WCC behind Gonzaga. Oh, nothing. It's only the most anticipated season in Rutgers history. Steve Pikiell and his assistant, Brandin Knight, diligently worked for years to recruit two blue-chip studs — Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey — and here they are. Yes, Rutgers will suit up quite possibly two future top-five NBA Draft picks. This is going to be fascinating, to say the least. Harper will run the offense; he's the younger brother of Ron Harper Jr., who is one of the best players in program history. Bailey is a bouncy wing who might be the most athletic freshman in the country. Those two won't explicitly be tasked with being the leaders of this team, but from the outside in, that's how it will be viewed. Harper and Bailey all but guarantee a big jump from last year's putrid offense, which ranked 295th at KenPom. Harper gets the benefit of starting beside Jeremiah Williams, who started 11 of his 12 games last season after returning from injury. No one's quite sure how this is going to go, and questions loom with RU's interior defense, but few teams in '24-25 will rank as high in watchability as the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. What a world. I like this world! The Aztecs get a top-40 designation from me due to coaching stability and proven culture. This program lost a LOT from 2023-24: Jaedon LeDee (that one's gonna leave a mark), Lamont Butler, Micah Parrish, Darrion Trammell. The best returnee is Reese Waters (9.6 ppg, 3.7 rpg). A year ago, nobody had LeDee as a top-20 player in the country, but that's precisely what he became. Can Waters make a jump that's in that ballpark? He'll get help with Miles Byrd, a stretchy wing who symbolizes a lot of what makes SDSU's defense so firm year in, year out. One new name to know is former FAU guard Nick Boyd, who has a swagger on the court that will fit right in with Brian Dutcher's program. Boyd might be good for a couple of 25-point nights, and in turn, could improve the Aztecs' chances at winning yet another Mountain West title. The MW will soon degrade, due to SDSU leaving alongside a few other teams. In these next two years, it should be a compelling battle for supremacy before this league is subdued — so soon after its best season in history. With a workable troop of fourth- and fifth-year players, plus the arrival of a five-star big man, the Terrapins can course-correct in a big way from last season's letdown. Kevin Willard's team was a confounding 16-17, done in by awful 3-point shooting and a stagnant offense. Look for that to change due to the arrival of Belmont transfer Ja'Kobe Gillespie (38.7% from beyond the arc) and South Florida import Selton Miguel (39%). Maryland lost Donta Scott and Jahmri Young, but Julian Reese is back in the frontcourt and will play the 4 alongside freshman center and local high school hero Derik Queen, who ranked 12th in the Class of 2024 according to 247Sports. Reese's defense should help Maryland rank well nationally in efficiency. I don't know if Queen will be high-impact in the first six weeks of the season, but I think he rounds into form by February and gets Maryland firmly into the bubble mix. The Longhorns' shift into the SEC (this feels like it's going to take some getting used to) is going to coincide with a big shift in the roster. A lot of old hands are no longer wearing burnt orange: Max Abmas, Dylan Disu, Tyrese Hunter, Dillon Mitchell, even Brock Cunningham (gone already? I jest) have moved on. That equates to 80% of the team's minutes flipping for the season ahead. Rodney Terry essentially has a rebuild on his hands, but at least he's got a terrific freshman wing in Tre Johnson to do it with. Johnson is the sleeper pick to be the nation's best freshman. Ranked sixth overall in the class, he was a big-gulp scorer as a prospect and figures to have a lot of touches on a team that will be looking for guys to step up on offense. Johnson figures to start alongside four other guys who are all much older and seniors/fifth-year players. Kadin Shedrick is the most important returning UT player; he'll hold down the 5. Arthur Kaluma is in Austin to chase the NCAA Tournament after missing out last year at Kansas State. Tramon Mark is back in the state after a one-year detour with Arkansas. Look for him to be critical as a leader for Terry's team, which has some interesting pieces. I can see a way for Texas to make hay in the new-look SEC, but it's likely going to be in the bubble mix come March. It's hard to catapult season-ending momentum into the following campaign, but let's see if Pitt can do it. I like the Panthers to be a bubble team after missing out (narrowly) on the NCAAs last season following a 10-3 finish and a 22-11 record. Jeff Capel is now in Year 7, with one NCAA trip in the first six. Pitt's AD was unexpectedly let go this offseason, which could put Capel's job at risk if he severely underachieves, but I like this team to comfortably finish in the top half of the ACC and make the Big Dance. The Panthers have somewhat quietly moved into second-tier status in the ACC in the past couple of years. Will this group keep that going? The roster suggests a competitive team with a reasonable shot at winning north of 20 games again. Ishmael Leggett is a key player back, as is Jaland Lowe, who will be a pop guy in 2024-25, especially after Bub Carrington's meteoric rise to one-and-done NBA Draft lottery pick. Lowe could follow Carrington's course in 2025, honestly. Blake Hinson also no longer being here also dings Pitt a bit, but, but, but: The Panthers return four of their top six scorers, which is about as good of a situation as you can ask for at a high-major school that didn't make the tournament. If you missed Jackson Shelstad's freshman year, don't make a similar mistake this upcoming season. Shelstad (12.8 ppg) is probably among the 10 best sophomores in the sport, and he'll have a shot at being a first- or second-team guy in the Big Ten. (Still feels weird to type it, let alone read it.) Dana Altman was hoping to win an NCAA appeal to get one more season with N'Faly Dante, but that didn't happen. Who's the big man to step up now? Senior Nathan Bittle, who will have to pop his 10.0 points/4.4 rebounds line from last season. After a one-year East Coast junket at Villanova, former Washington State wing TJ Bamba has returned West to suit up as a Duck. I suspect he'll get north of 320 shots in 30-plus games. This is Dana Altman's 15th season in Eugene. The previous 14 featured 20 wins or more. In fact, Altman's coached 27 consecutive years above .500. Oregon might have question marks, but the track record mandates putting the Ducks comfortably in the top 50. I was absurdly high on the Aggies last season (we're talking irrationally high), only to see Buzz Williams' team pretty much perform where most others thought they'd be. A 21-15 record and a No. 9 seed. So: they were solidly solid, but a few matters short of pretty good. Will this group be more consistent? Wade Taylor IV returns for his senior season, and after averaging 19.1 points in 2023-24 (fourth-best in the SEC), he's got a chance to be No. 1 in the conference. A lot will filter down from Taylor's production. Fellow senior backcourt mate Manny Obaseki will be inserted into the starting lineup full time, getting that promotion along with another semi-starter from last season, Jace Carter on the wing. My concern with ranking A&M higher is tied to the reality that Williams is yet to have a quality shooting team in his five seasons with the program. Every one he's had has rated outside the top 150 in 2- and 3-point percentage, many outside the top 200. Until that changes, A&M is going to have a limit on its proficiency and efficiency inside the SEC and out. After losing out to Duke in the high-stakes dual recruitment of Cameron and Cayden Boozer (who will be in college in 2025), Jim Larrañaga now focuses most of his energy on reversing the bad vibes that concluded Miami's 2023-24 season, an unspeakable 10-game nightmare that rendered the Canes irrelevant at 15-17. Nijel Pack and Matthew Cleveland decided to stay in Coral Gables, Florida, and that will prove vital to Miami's chances to be a bubble team in the ACC. The Hurricanes lost a lot from last season's team, but those two were the ones they couldn't afford to see leave. Cleveland and Pack joining forces with a fun freshman, shooting guard Jalil Bethea, in addition to Stetson transfer Jalen Blackmon (who had the game of his life in the ASUN title game, erupting for 43 points and getting the Hatters into the field of 68) will ensure this squad is potent and powerful in shot selection and creation. Few teams underachieved harder relative to the talent on the roster than The U a season ago. I can't see Larrañaga standing for that again. It might not be as good as Miami's football team in 2024, but The U will be back in the better half of the ACC. What a highly unusual situation in Columbus. Chris Holtmann was fired on Valentine's Day and everyone presumed the Buckeyes would chase, and land, a buzzy name. (Dusty May was the presumed initial target.) But Jake Diebler went from interim to full-time coach, thanks to going 8-3 after moving over a seat. Diebler has done well in his first season in terms of roster assembly. Most importantly, Bruce Thornton stuck around for one more season with the Bucks. I think he's got a great chance to be a top-five player in the Big Ten. He'll team up with boomerang transfer Meechie Johnson, who is back in an OSU uni after two years with South Carolina. Diebler recruited two former five-star prospects who didn't pan out at the blue-blood level: Sean Stewart (Duke) and Aaron Bradshaw (Kentucky). They're likely to start with another transfer, an understated team guy, Micah Parrish of San Diego State, who will be a utility guy to say the least. Not having Taison Chatman (torn ACL) will ding Ohio State's depth in the backcourt, unless 6-foot freshman Juni Mobley emerges as one of the best 3-point shooters in the Big Ten with haste. Diebler as a head coach of a high-major with no experience other than February and March's abbreviated trial run will make this a TBD season. But the talent should have OSU a bubble team at minimum. A year ago, I aggressively placed Georgia in the top 50 of my rankings, which I'm brave enough to admit was a fatuous mistake. This season, it's not such a fable. The Bulldogs fully expect to be competitive and in the top half of the SEC, thanks above all to anticipated reforms with the team's rebounding. (It's been baaaaaad.) Mike White has two players back who will be starters in Silas Demary Jr. and Blue Cain. Demary really might be the most undervalued player in the SEC. Also key: White has a freshman in Asa Newell who is the most talented newbie to come onto that campus (for basketball, anyway) since Anthony Edwards. Newell's game is nothing like Edwards, however. He's lean, stands approximately 6-10, can step out and shoot and plays with a good head on his shoulders. He'll need to be a top-10 freshman in the country to validate my UGA ranking, and I think he's gonna pull it off. Look for Demary to step up and be one of the best defenders in the SEC — with backup De'Shayne Montgomery not that far behind. Tyrin Lawrence (via Vandy) and RJ Godfrey (via Clemson) should round out the starting five. Kim English is on a mission to not put PC in the position it was last season, when spotty metrics results wound up holding the Friars outside the velvet rope to get into the NCAAs. That team won 21 games and did so without Bryce Hopkins (while Devin Carter turned into the Big East Player of the Year). Hopkins is back, however, and approaching 100% status after tearing his left ACL. Look for the combo forward to increase his previous Friar averages of 15.6 ppg and 8.6 rebounds, and in the process, potentially become the most valuable player on a Big East roster. English dipped into the portal and added Bensley Joseph (Miami), Wesley Cardet Jr. (Chicago State) and Christ Essandoko (Saint Joe's) to help out returning guard Jayden Pierre (9.5 ppg). With Josh Oduro now in the NBA, watch Oswin Erhunmwunse step in and patrol the paint. Every year when I build out this list, there are invariably a half-dozen power-conference teams that feel like their range could be anywhere from No. 30 to No. 70. Providence is one of those teams this year. The Lobos were laughably only put into the Big Dance last season because they won the Mountain West tourney title after an enthralling run that included five wins in the final six games prior to March Madness. UNM's inclusion gave the Mountain West a conference-record six bids. This team probably can't match the firepower and athleticism of that one, but it can best it in tenacity and resourcefulness. Much of that will spring from junior guard Donovan Dent, one of the best players in the Mountain West. Dent, whose gumption is on display multiple times a night, averaged 14.1 points and figures to up that number in 2024-25. He'll have returning C Nelly Junior Joseph starting with him, giving Richard Pitino's team a couple of go-to guys in very different positions. I have to ding UNM for the losses of Jaelen House, Jamal Mashburn Jr. and JT Toppin, but the program's arrow has been going in the good direction since Pitino arrived three years ago and doesn't seem likely to go crooked over the next six months. It's time for the Braves to ascend to the top of the Missouri Valley — and become one of the best mid-major teams in the process. Brian Wardle, in this his 10th season in Peoria, Illinois, has his best team. And consider: Bradley ranked 64th at KenPom last season. Thanks to returning much of his roster (led by point guard Duke Deen and 5-man Darrius Hannah), Wardle can rely on veteran experience and a locker room with great chemistry. The Braves have to overcome losing their leading scorer (Connor Hickman) and best defender (Malevy Lyons), but seem to have most boxes checked for a mid-major darling. Great size, culture established, good guard play, capable 3-point shooting. The Braves have two MVC tourney championships under Wardle but just one NCAA appearance because 2020 was ripped away. Drake had been the Cinderella candidate in the Valley in recent years, and now Bradley should take that mantle. The Blazers are equipped with four returning starters from a 23-win team. If Memphis doesn't wind up as the best team in the AAC, UAB (officially the preseason league favorite) is the obvious candidate to take the top slot. Any team that deploys a man in the middle with the first name Yaxel and a pesky guard nicknamed "Butta" figures to be set up for a certain level of success, deemed necessary by the basketball gods. Yaxel Lendeborg is a 6-9 hoss — a senior center who will threaten to finish with 25 double-doubles. Butta Johnson is a bit of a dynamo who should see his shot opportunities improve playing next to underrated Georgia Southern transfer Tyren Moore. UAB will be a problem in the American because Lendeborg is complemented by Christian Coleman, a power forward with a tough nose around the rim. Kennedy knows his team's defensive issues last season sold them short. We should expect a more well-rounded squad in Birmingham. Everyone knows the deal on the Main Line. Kyle Neptune needs to make the NCAA Tournament in order to get to a fourth year with Nova. The program has quickly gone from a rock-solid top-10 reputation to confounding disappointment over the past two seasons. Now the Cats ready for a campaign with only seven players holding D-I experience. Five of those seven, at least, are 21, 22 or 23 years old. Eric Dixon opted to stay, and that might be the thing that saves VU and keeps them competitive in the Big East. He and Jordan Longino will be the team's leaders, while Wooga Poplar (via Miami) was the Big Transfer Get that Nova desperately needed in the back end of the portal cycle. Villanova hasn't missed the NCAAs three years in a row since Jay Wright's first three on the Main Line (2002-04). In order to avoid that in 2025, Neptune's going to have to overachieve with a roster that ranks well outside the top five of the Big East. A program under pressure that has responded well in previous iterations. What will this one do? If you're outside the top 50 you probably aren't in as a bubble team come March, but I think BU is one of the best sleeper NCAA candidates out there. Thad Matta's toiled a bit for two years in Indy, yes, however his coaching acumen can't be questioned. By bringing back much of the roster from an 18-win team, the expectation should be to hit 20 victories. The two biggest names still here are G/F Pierre Brooks and F Jahmyl Telfort. They'll be wonderful on a team that should move into the top 50 of offensive efficiency. I do wonder about the defensive integrity and the lack of higher-end athletes. Tulane transfer Kolby King is a guy who will also emerge here, but needs to beef up into a strong two-way player to bolster the loss of Posh Alexander. A veritable mid-major beast these days. Bryce Drew's program is coming off a first-round upset of Saint Mary's in the 5/12 game, giving GCU a program-record 30th win in the process. The Antelopes were 65th in my rankings a year ago, which proved too low. I'm bumping 'em up that much more heading into November. Four starters return, led by Tyon Grant-Foster, a 20-point-per-game guard who is one of the three-or-so most talented mid-major players in the sport. If bringing back a healthy portion of the team's scoring and minutes wasn't enough to convince you this team can win another NCAA Tournament game, know that TCU transfer JaKobe Coles and his 42% 3-point accuracy is also in the mix here. The Lopes are overwhelming WAC favorites yet again before the program moves on to the WCC next year. Non-Rambler fans, If I ask you what this team's win total was last season, you think you can guess it within two spots? Loyola Chicago went 23-10 in a critical bounce-back campaign after the disastrous 10-win season the year prior. For as good and improved as LUC was last season, the program sure didn't seem like it received a fair amount of attention and publicity. Drew Valentine will need to have another 20-win season to get his flowers, and I'm here to project he will. Three starters are back at a program that retained five rotation players in all and should have the makings of a top-40 per-possession defense. Miles Rubin averaged just 6.2 points, but I don't know how many players who didn't score 10 per game were more valuable, at least at the mid-major level, than him. He set the program record with 76 blocks in a season. Rubin, Des Watson (high-end A-10 player) and Jayden Dawson will be the triumvirate taking on a not-so-mysterious-but-still-sorta-unpredictable top third of the Atlantic 10. The Ramblers upgraded to this conference from the MVC two years ago. This is the season they show they made the right decision. Here's a big swing. It was a slog in Year 1 under Micah Shrewsberry, as anticipated, but I'm tagging the Irish to be one of the more surprising high-majors in the months ahead. Shrews was able to retain four starters, the most important being point guard Markus Burton (17.5 ppg, 4.3 apg, 3.3 rpg at 5-foot-11). Burton gets to play beside a utilitarian transfer who should fit like a glove: Princeton guard Matt Allocco. ND brings back guys who don't have big Q scores but are highly valued on that campus: Tae Davis, Braeden Shrewsberry and J.R. Konieczny. The Irish are going to punch above their weight and steal a few games as a home underdog. The program's been on fire recently with some big-time recruiting wins. Notre Dame will likely be a projected NCAA team a year from now, but in this bridge season I like Shrewsberry's crew to go from 13 wins to at least five more than that in '24-25. With all due respect to the predictive metrics out there and how they're formulated and calculated, the Bulls team I saw last season looked better than the one listed online. USF ranked 87th at KenPom, 84th at Torvik, 78th at EvanMiya and 91st at BPI. I'm not going to say USF was a top-60 team last season, because the data's in and the data across different algorithms is correct. However, if you watched USF occasionally and saw how that fan base was reinvigorated, how well-coached it was under Amir Abdur-Rahim and its new life as a 25-win team, you saw top-50 aura. Despite Abdur-Rahim not taking a bigger job after just one year, but losing vital pieces regardless, I'm buying in with the Bulls. I think they play their way to a second consecutive 20-win season. I think they build on a fun story in Tampa. I think they do it behind lead guard Jayden Reid. He's an easy candidate for AAC POY consideration, and he'll likely be tasked with a lot after USF got poached in the portal. Reid has Brandon Stroud and Kobe Knox flanking him, giving the Bulls the uncommon situation of coming off a good year with returning pieces, but likely being underrated. (Except here, of course.) USF has a good policy in place: replace the departing coach with the best-qualified in-house candidate. It did this in 2019 when Kyle Smith left and Todd Golden scooted a seat over. Then, when Golden took the Florida job in 2022, Chris Gerlufsen was promoted from within. Since then, the Dons have gone 43-25 and maintained top-four status in the WCC, which is where they'll be again for the next five months. Gerlufsen is fortunate to return four high-leverage players from last season's 23-11 team: Marcus Williams, Malik Thomas and Ndewedo Newbury (all seniors), plus sophomore combo guard (and somewhat rare non-Gonzaga WCC freshman of the year winner) Ryan Beasley. This team wasn't free throw-prone a season ago, something that should change for the better. A nice offense is likely to upgrade to a good one, and the defense can again be top-60 in the nation. That will lay the course for USF's inside track to third place in the WCC behind Gonzaga and Saint Mary's. What Will Wade did to change the situation in mere months' time in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is outrageous. McNeese won 30 games last year and finished 67th at KenPom, by far its best ever. Prior to 2023-24, McNeese's average KenPom finish in its history was 257th; the Cowboys finished between 276 and 335 in the 11 preceding years. Then Wade arrives and all the suck and ineptitude is vaporized out of the program. McNeese had a 19-game turnaround, tying an NCAA record. And remember, Wade had to sit for the opening stretch of last season because of suspension. Of course, he's only there because of the NCAA violations and stain from his LSU days, but regardless, this is now a low-major monster. McNeese will rule the Southland with ease again. Look for Christian Shumate (awesome two-way player), Ole Miss transfer Brandon Murray and Saint Louis transfer Sincere Parker to guide the Cowboys to at least 25 wins again. THE story with Wisconsin is how it fares after being brutalized by the portal ("portalized"?) after being upset as a 5-seed in the first round by James Madison. The Badgers watched Chucky Hepburn (Louisville), AJ Storr (Kansas) and Connor Essegian (Nebraska) walk away, dropping their ceiling in the process. This is a program that's held a lot of stability in roster retention — doing so against the currents of the sport — but this year was different. At least Steven Crowl, Max Klesmit and John Blackwell stuck around. (Tyler Wahl graduated, alas.) There can be good portal news, though: John Tonje was a non-factor at Mizzou last year because of injury, but it wouldn't stun me at all if he was a double-double guy in his final college season. Greg Gard has a big task ahead in what seems fated to have Wisconsin floating in the middle of a boggy Big Ten. One of about five teams in the ACC that I think has the capacity to finish as high as seventh and as low as 15th. It's just so tough to tell in this first year of overwrought high-major expansion. The Orange bring back JJ Starling, who's a lot of fun and should be in striking distance of averaging 17 points. Eddie Lampkin (previously of TCU and Colorado renown) will pay rent on the low block for his final year of eligibility. Junior wing Chris Bell (41.7% from 3-point land) is underrated and may unlock this team's ceiling. Hofstra transfer Jaquan Carlos is also getting some buzz in the preseason, so we're on the lookout for him. I like the Orange to finish top 10 in the ACC, but it could be a bumpy route to the finish. Consider how Red Autry won 20 games in his debut season. SU should be in that range again. This is a respectable jump from last season's Mississippi debut for Chris Beard, which included 20 wins (good) but also had the Rebels finish 79th at Torvik and 86th at KenPom (not good). The Rebels return PG Jaylen Murray and combo guard Matthew Murrell, in addition to 6-8 wing Jaemyn Brakefield. The defense was barely adequate at times, and now Jamarion Sharp, Moussa Cisse and Allen Flanigan have moved on. Can the group be collectively better? How will the scheme change? There's a lot to prove in the frontcourt. I've got some reservations over Beard getting this new roster (which includes four senior transfers, led by Sean Pedulla and Dre Davis) to be good enough on defense to make the NCAA Tournament. But the scoring capability will likely lead to some barn-burning atmospheres every month. Someone's going to surprise in the Big 12. Why not the Knights? Johnny Dawkins' team had three eyebrow-raising wins last season (Kansas, at Texas and at TCU), which has me thinking this program could be in for more party spoiling. Because UCF isn't appointment TV, it has one of the most unheralded (but reliable) duos in high-major ball. Watch out for guards Jaylin Sellers and Darius Johnson. They combined to average 31 points last season and could hit the 35 mark this season. The strange thing here is there's a bunch of guys on this roster who back stories that are longer than novellas (Mikey Williams, Dior Johnson, Benny Williams), but if the chemistry is in line, UCF will have top-half-of-the-league talent in the Big 12. And should the defense again rate top-30, like last year, then this outlook won't be bullish. Wolf Pack fans found me with a quickness a year ago when I stupidly neglected to include Nevada in my top 101. (Steve Alford's team was soundly in the top 60 of all metrics at year's end.) No such mistake this year. This is easily a top-70 roster. Alford is running it back with his three best at the 3, 4 and 5: Tre Coleman, Nick Davidson and KJ Hymes. Not many teams are able to claim the same. Look for Nevada to be in the thick of the NCAA convo because of its size and know-how. The backcourt of Tyler Rolison (big-time role increase) and Kobe Sanders (Cal Poly transfer) might take a little time to jell, but so long as they're counterplaying off the gravity from the aforementioned frontcourt, Rolison and Sanders are going to have a lot of chances to capitalize with the spacing provided in Alford's system. If not for super-senior guard Max Shulga, the Rams would be about two dozen spots further down on this list. Shulga, who has spent his career with coach Ryan Odom, had a few weeks over the spring where he opted for a future at Villanova. But after careful consideration, he doubled back to Richmond and will be the focal point on one of the best teams in the A-10. Putting it plainly: VCU has valid NCAA hopes because Shulga's here. As a career 40% 3-point shooter, his leadership by example will be vital. Remember, the Rams went 24-14 last season and would have made the NCAA Tournament had they not stubbed their toe in the conference title game against Duquesne. Odom brings back three starters (Shulga, Joe Bamisile, Zeb Jackson) who also led the team in scoring, giving this group a realistic chance not just at winning the A-10, but at making up ground in the nonconference, where games and scheduling never come easy for VCU. I count no more than three programs, max, that will have to overcome the loss of a player the way Northwestern will with Boo Buie, who graduated as NU's all-time leading scorer. That aside, times are pretty sweet now in Evanston, Illinois. Chris Collins guided the team to a second straight NCAA Tournament bid, which was previously considered a fantasy for a school with just three of those in its history. NU will drag some higher-end Big Ten teams into escape room-type scenarios at Welsh-Ryan Arena, where it's had a handful of loud upset wins over ranked opponents in recent seasons. Key names back: Brooks Barnhizer, Ty Berry, Nick Martinelli. Barnhizer is quite the well-rounded player, especially when you consider how much time he spends on the floor (more than 90% of minutes last season) without having noticeable efficiency drop-offs. Chris Jans is the only coach in Bulldogs history to make the NCAAs in his first two seasons. (He's the only coach to reach the Big Dance in Year 1, too.) It's been a really good fit from the get-go in Starkville. The Bulldogs do have quite the makeover, bringing aboard six transfers and two freshmen. The best player back is one of the best sophomores in college basketball. Josh Hubbard averaged 17.1 points as a 5-9 combo guard in a defense-leaning scheme. Can't wait to see how he follows up a delectable debut season. Hubbard is the guy on offense, while Cameron Matthews is the platonic ideal of a switchable 6-7 defender. MSU figures to rank top-30 in defensive efficiency behind the captaincy of Matthews, who will be in the mix for SEC Defensive Player of the Year. I presume I'll be lower on the Bulldogs than other preseason rankings. It's not about Jans. Instead, it's more due to the very likely scenario the SEC is a top-two league, in addition to my wait-and-see approach on the portal compilation in Starkville, which needs to prove its offensive capacity. Most everyone (yep, yours truly included) was wrong a year ago when BYU was projected in the bottom half of the Big 12, only to see Mark Pope win 23 games and finish in the top 20 in advanced-metrics rankings. Now Pope is at Kentucky and Kevin Young — a longtime NBA assistant, most recently with the Suns — has made the pivot to the college game. This will be one fascinating experiment, as Young is going to try to NBA-ify the Cougs while also adhering to certain structure and schemes fitted for college. Fortunately for Young, he was able to retain Dallin Hall, Trevin Knell, Fousseyni Traore and Richie Saunders, all of whom could have left but chose to keep on with BYU's unique culture. It's likely to be bumpy in Year 1, but the vision is to fund BYU and turn it into one of the top four programs in the Big 12 by the end of the decade. (Case in point: The Cougars are a major player for the top prospect in the country, AJ Dybantsa.) Young might pull a Pope and wildly overshoot expectations again, but I'll give the Coogs plenty of slack in his first season. What the Wolfpack did in March/April amounted to the most statistically improbable Final Four run ever. From trailing putrid Louisville in the first half of the first game of the ACC tourney to winning nine straight (which had never been done before) and making history in reaching the Final Four. Will there be a hangover in Raleigh? DJ Burns, Casey Morsell and DJ Horne won't be there to experience it. Kevin Keatts returns Jayden Taylor, Michael O'Connell and Ben Middlebrooks. Louisville transfer Brandon Huntley-Hatfield will step in and play the 4 and/or the 5 and probably be ecstatic to be in new surroundings. Last season's team found a way to scout effectively, capitalize on mismatches (a lot of this was Burns) and never take stretches off in games. It will need to do this to maximum effect in order to get back to the NCAAs. Ohio is blessed to bring back six of its top eight players from last season. Senior guard Shereef Mitchell is the latest sturdy captain in the backcourt. Combo forward AJ Clayton is one of the best 3-point-shooting frontcourt players at his level. He hit 40.1% of his triples a season ago. It's the MAC, so the league tournament is far from fair to the top seed, but it's probably rational to expect one of Akron, Ohio or Toledo to wind up winning the conference. With Akron losing too much firepower from a 24-win team and Toledo rebuilding half its roster, Jeff Boals' Bobcats are my pick to emerge as the top squad in a quintessential mid-major league. The Shockers were merely 15-19 a season ago, but it was Paul Mills' first season on the job after doing a wonderful six-year stay with Oral Roberts. Mills brings back five of his top seven minutes-getters, which should convey an above-.500 season. Wichita State figures to get consistent scoring from guards Xavier Bell and Harlond Beverly, who lead a group that's old-old. A lot of teams in this sport are veteran-capped, given this is the final year of the COVID bonus year, but Wichita State's projected starting five will rank near the top in experience. All five are fourth- and fifth-year players, and Mills will have three more battle-scarred seniors readily available off the bench. Projecting WSU as a top-75 team is a dart in the dark, but the program has the players and figures to have the coaching. Beyond that, the American Athletic Conference on average is able to put four teams into the top 75. Let's give 'em a shot. The Red Wolves should supplant James Madison as the premier team in the Sun Belt. Arkansas State was so feared that Memphis and Alabama were the only two schools from high-major and/or multi-bid leagues this past offseason that agreed to play Bryan Hodgson's team. Hodgson, a second-year coach, has done an outstanding job after spending eight years learning under Nate Oats. Three starters return from the program's second 20-win season since 1998. (A young Grant McCasland was responsible for the other one in 2017.) Taryn Todd and Derrian Ford are the notable guys back, but the spark plug should be Louisiana transfer Kobe Julien, who averaged 17+ last season. Craig Smith has gone from 11 wins to 17 to 22 in his first three years in Salt Lake City. The task to get even more in Year 4 will be immense. The Utes lost Branden Carlson to graduation and Deivon Smith to St. John's, which is going to be a big hit, as those were two of the 10 best players in the Pac-12 last season. Now Utah's in the Big 12. It returns Gabe Madsen, the only player back who was a double-digit scorer last season (13.2 ppg). Lawson Lovering and Hunter Erickson are also key returnees. Stretchy San Francisco guard Mike Sharavjamts is poised to be a difference-maker, and Baylor transfer Miro Little should also be featured in the starting lineup. The Pirates narrowly missed last year's NCAAs (then won the NIT) and, even worse, lost Kadary Richmond to Big East rival St. John's. Shaheen Holloway won 17 games in Year 1 and 25 last season. I think he splits that in '24-25 and ends up with either 20 or 21 Ws. Dylan Addae-Wusu and Isaiah Coleman return; expect both to become double-digit scorers after combining to average 14 points last season. Holloway brought on seven transfers, the most notable being an intra-league Big East swap of his own in Garwey Dual (Providence). The implied lack of 3-point prowess is striking. Without enough long-distance threats, it is hard to get the Hall higher on the list than this. That said, while it's casual to underestimate this team, keep in mind Holloway's one of the best do-more-with-less coaches in the high-major ranks. Few folks in the media were as consistently pro-Isaiah Stevens over the past two years as your humble author here. Stevens stuck around in Fort Collins when he easily could have left in 2022 or 2023 and sought bigger NIL paydays. He guided CSU as a point guard with few peers (if any) at his level. Now that his college career is done, the Rams have to hope Northern Iowa transfer Bowen Born can facilitate and guide the ship. It won't be easy, but at least Nique Clifford (a multi-tool 6-5 wing) is back. Clifford figures to be a first team-type of All-Mountain West player. He averaged 12.2 points and that number is a stone-cold lock to inflate. Clifford was a down-transfer from Colorado who is a primo example of how moving to a lower level can vastly improve a player's college experience. Niko Medved also brings back Jalen Lake in a starting role. Probably won't compete for the Mountain West title but should be good enough to flirt with the bubble. I was on hand in Manhattan in March for the Tigers' stunning 90-81 loss in the Ivy League Tournament semifinals to Brown. (Princeton trailed by as many as 22 in that game.) Coach Mitch Henderson was visibly and understandably furious in the aftermath. That aggravation should serve as a motivator, not an inhibitor, for the Tigers in what should be another very good year in Princeton. Last season's team was 24-3 before losing its final two games. Crucially, it returns shooting guard Xaivian Lee, who is the most talented player in the Ivy. But he wasn't the 2024 Ivy POY. That would be Caden Pierce, who is also still wearing black and orange. Those two give the Tigers dependability, leadership and star power. If Henderson enables it, Pierce and Lee could rank among the highest-scoring duos in the country. Both are capable of averaging 20 if they want it. Russell Turner has built up one of the strongest mid-major résumés in the game. With a 289-180 record in 14 seasons, he's finished half of his campaigns with the best team in the Big West. That should be the case again in 2024-25 because the Anteaters have four starters sticking around from a 24-win team that finished 82nd at KenPom. It would come as no shock if this team wound up having a top-50 defense, too. UCI has won on the strength of its bigs in the past, but this group figures to carve its way to another 20-win year based on the depth of its guards. The two starters who should pace this group are Justin Hohn and Andre Henry — a duo that should wind up being the best 3-point shooting backcourt in the Big West. Few coaches have ever had bigger jumps in success in their first three years of Division I coaching than Josh Schertz. His first season at Indiana State was 11-20. Then he went 23-13 in 2022-23. Last season ISU made the NIT title game and went 32-7. If not for an unprecedented amount of bid thieves, the Sycamores would have been in the NCAAs. And Schertz might be coaching at Louisville if they had danced. Instead, Saint Louis is the spot, and it feels right. This is a good jump and the type of hire that SLU fans can eagerly embrace. They've got a shot to once again have a relevant program in short order. A big reason is because Schertz brought MVC Player of the Year Robbie Avila with him. The lovable baller with too many great nicknames (Cream Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Nerd, Steph Blurry) instantly becomes the must-watch player in the A-10. Isaiah Swope (who sank 114 treys a season ago) also made the move down from Indiana State to be a Billiken. Schertz's avant-garde offense combined with some shrewd roster-building provides instant credibility. Eric Musselman won 24 games in his first season at Nevada (2015-16) and 20 in his first at Arkansas (2019-20). Neither team made the NCAAs, and it seems more likely than not that will be true of the Trojans in their first year under Muss and in the West Coast-ified Big Ten. A double-digit transfer load comes aboard, many of them one-year guys in a grad-school year. Led most likely by Desmond Claude (Xavier), it's unclear just how well this group of ballers from Boise State, UMass, UC San Diego, Michigan, Northern Colorado and beyond will jell. Muss is right at home in SoCal, and if it hits, this has a shot to be the one job he sticks at for the better part of a decade. But it's hard to see this assembly as a top-half Big Ten outfit. After regularly rating in the top 100 when Phil Martelli was there, SJU finally broke back into that echelon again by finishing 99th at KenPom last season, Billy Lange's fifth tour. I think the Hawks can be similarly good, if not even slightly better, due to all-Atlantic 10 guard Erik Reynolds II playing one final season on the hill. Reynolds' 17.3 points per game led the league, and teaming up alongside returnee Xzayvier Brown (12.7 ppg) will give the Hawks one of the best backcourt tandems in the A-10. Brown is a stud and could compete with Reynolds for A-10 POY honors. Rasheer Fleming is also back, giving SJU three starting players who stuck around and averaged double digits. That's a luxury few non-high-major programs can claim in 2024. It's a reboot in Fort Worth for Jamie Dixon. The Horned Frogs figure to start four transfers alongside returning center Ernest Udeh Jr. Dixon will also have seven players on the roster yet to play a college game. That's going to lead to piles of losses in the Big 12. Unavoidable. I like the addition of Arizona State transfer Frankie Collins, who will be the head of the snake. He'll be flanked by Noah Reynolds (via Green Bay) and Brendan Wenzel (via Wyoming). TCU is coming off its third straight NCAA appearance, which had never happened in program history. A step or two back in '24-25 is almost certainly coming, but that's no indictment on Dixon's track record. Ben Jacobson has been ping-ponging between good and bad seasons for almost a decade. Here's UNI's win totals, starting in 2016 and up through last season: 23, 14, 16, 16, 25, 10, 20, 14, 19. The Panthers haven't won at least 19 games in back-to-back seasons since their two most recent NCAA Tournament showings in 2015/16. While Bradley is clearly the preseason No. 1 in the MVC, Northern Iowa is a fair pick to finish second — and have its best two-year push since 2016. Well-rounded power wing Tytan Anderson and 6-4 point guard Trey Campbell will guide the way in Cedar Falls. A bizarrely god-awful season (from 25-10 in Dennis Gates' first year to 8-24 last season, including going 0-19 in the SEC) meant Mizzou was one of the most shocking bad teams in the country. There are reasons for belief in a healthy turnaround, though. The Tigers figure to play seven guys in the primary rotation who are juniors, seniors or fifth-year players. Wing Tamar Bates (13.5 ppg) returns alongside Caleb Grill, who only played nine games due to injury but should become a double-digit scorer. Duke transfer power forward Mark Mitchell was a crucial portal pickup, as was Iowa's Tony Perkins on the wing. The Tigers will be better built to withstand the rigors of the SEC banked on a vastly improved defense. Gates is too good of a coach to have a terrible team in back-to-back seasons. Fran McCaffery has a good shot at coaching another First Team All-Big Ten player. Payton Sandfort is coming into his fourth season of college ball, having averaged 16.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and shot 37.9% from beyond the arc last season. He's going to be Iowa's No. 1 (and likely No. 2) option on offense as the Hawkeyes look to finish top-20 in offensive efficiency (per KenPom) for an eighth straight season. The defensive concerns are again heavy, which is why I'm predicting a subpar campaign in Iowa City, but if you like the Hawkeyes you should feel great. I don't think there's a team I'm more often wrong about heading into a season than Iowa. Louisville fans aren't looking for a lulu of a season, but they do think Pat Kelsey recruited a roster good enough to go from 12 total wins in two years under Kenny Payne to an NCAA bid in Year 1 of Kelsey. We shall see. As I said on the Eye on College Basketball Podcast last week, Louisville is among the toughest teams to peg in the ACC. Just an outright rebuild emerging from an awful situation. Working in Kelsey's favor: His only season below .500 was his first as a head coach in 2012-13 at Winthrop (14-17). The Cards bring on Chucky Hepburn from Wisconsin, Terrence Edwards Jr. from JMU — who was REALLY good — plus Noah Waterman via BYU, a few guys from Charleston and Kasean Pryor from South Florida. I want to see how the pieces coagulate and I want to see if Kelsey can and does play as up-tempo with U of L as he did with Winthrop and Charleston. James Jones needs four more wins to hit 400 for his career, which should culminate before we get to December. Jones is one of the longest-tenured coaches in Division I; this is his 26th season with the Bulldogs. (It's to Yale's benefit, but this guy should have been hired to a bigger job three-to-eight years ago, frankly.) With Jones still operating in his prime, Yale can be a top-100 team for the fifth time in seven seasons. With Princeton the practical pick to win the Ivy, Yale is the evident No. 2 — and may well win the league's automatic bid again in the intimate and pressurized confines of that league bracket. The Elis lost Danny Wolf to Michigan, otherwise they'd be my preseason pick. Bez Mbeng and John Poulakidas (who had 28 vs. Auburn in the tournament) are back to ball in New Haven, Connecticut. After three consecutive 20-win seasons for a program that's produced a couple of top-20 NBA picks (Jalen Williams, Brandin Podziemski) as of late, let's toss them into the 100 And 1. Herb Sendek has a really good staff and didn't lose anyone to the portal (less than 10 teams did in all of college hoops) and should have nine guys playing double-digit minutes, which is why I've got the Broncos positioned to finish in the top four of the WCC. You best believe that Adama-Alpha Bal (a top-10 name in the sport) is ready for his senior year close-up. He'll team up with Johnny O'Neil, who is a jack-of-all-trades type … at 6-10. The top four of the WCC looks good again. It's a shame that the league is losing Gonzaga in two years, but that will help programs like Santa Clara break through after the breakup. Alan Huss had one of the best debut coaching seasons Division I has seen — regardless of conference designation — in recent memory. He took over the Panthers last season and transformed a school that averaged 13 wins over the previous seven seasons into a 27-9 inaugural campaign. Unfortunately for High Point, it got picked off in the Big South Tournament against Longwood, losing a heartbreaker by one in OT. Now Huss gets four starters back, including potential Big South POY Kezza Giffa and second-year defensive standout Juslin Bodo Bodo. The Gamecocks lost three of their top four scorers, who accounted for nearly 38 points per game, but do bring back one of the best sophomores in the country. Collin Murray-Boyles may sound like the name of the second-best striker for Ireland's World Cup team, but no. He's a 6-7 forward who has a great opportunity to step into the spotlight and be one of the five best players in the SEC. The lack of proven pieces around Murray-Boyles has me hesitant overall on the Gamecocks, who were one of the surprises of 2023-24 after winning 26 games and earning a No. 6 seed despite being picked dead last in the then-14-team SEC. The Hokies — and a few teams like them — will be interesting test cases for predictive metrics in this new phase of 16- and 18-team megaconferences. If a team like this goes 18-16 and finishes four games below .500 in league play, will it still work its way into the top 75? Glancing at VT's roster, you can make a case for not including this team in the top 101. But I will because Mike Young's a really good coach and should squeeze a lot out of his roster. Young is 92-66 in five seasons in Blacksburg, holding a 50-52 mark against ACC opponents. Virginia Tech brings aboard Charleston's Ben Burnham and Temple's Hysier Miller as its biggest stat guys in the portal. The attrition is huge; no ACC team that didn't undergo a coaching change lost a bigger dose of its roster than the Hokies. This one's admittedly a hunch based on little evidence. But guess what? Teams make huge jumps from well outside the top 100 every year. It's part of the fun of watching the season unfold. We've got two years until the Pac-12 revives. During its interregnum, Oregon State (and Washington State) are taking up residency in the WCC. I think the move will do wonders for Wayne Tinkle's program. Plus, the Beavers are loaded with guys between 6-7 and 7 feet. As Dan Patrick once said: Welcome to the Big Show. Can't wait to see how this roster-building approach fares in a mid-major league. The WCC schedule is now 18 games, with a home-and-home against Gonzaga guaranteed. Get this: Oregon State is 25-2 vs. Gonzaga, and 11-0 since Gonzaga went Division I in the early 1960s. The teams last met in 1991! Putting faith in a remarkable second-year spike for Georgetown under Ed Cooley. No. 90 doesn't get you anywhere near the NCAA tourney convo obviously, but I'll take a flier on Georgetown hitting 15 wins, upgrading its defense and beating at least three non-DePaul teams in the Big East. Malik Mack could be the star. The Harvard transfer is likely to be a high-volume producer alongside junior guard Jayden Epps. The addition of TCU forward Micah Peavy should provide G'town a necessary older-guy presence on a team that's got a lot of freshmen. What a story. Bucky McMillan, who grew up four miles from Samford and has lived his whole life in Birmingham, Alabama, took his BuckyBall style to its maximum potential (seemingly) by going from six wins in Year 1 to 27 and an NCAA Tournament berth in Year 4. Samford was 81st at KenPom last season after falling to Kansas in controversial fashion in the first round of the Big Dance. McMillan lost four starters, but I'd bank on this team being able to average north of 77 or 78 points (last year: 81.4) because of the style of play. Rylan Jones is the lone returning starter on a team that's projected to be the best in the SoCon. A lot of players are going to have an increase in minutes and impact. McMillan's press-for-40-minutes-no-matter-what blueprint is the only one of its kind in college basketball. Here are the teams outside the high-major leagues with the most wins over the last eight seasons: Gonzaga (121), Belmont (120) and Vermont (115). John Becker has made the NCAAs six times; 2025 feels like it will be No. 7 in Burlington. Related: UVM has ranked top-100 at KenPom six times in Becker's tenure; 2025 feels like it will be No. 7 in Burlington. Becker should be taking calls from dozens of coaches across the country so they can learn his secret for avoiding invariable pitfalls that affect most other mid-majors. Four starters are back from a No. 13 seed that went 28-7. Shamir Bogues seems to be the next big name in the Green Mountain State, but beyond individual play, Becker believes this team could be one of his best on defense. The Tigers have a chance to be the surprise mid-major team in the sport. Pat Skerry's team lost just two hoopers from last year's lineup that won 20 games (and they were to graduation and a down-transfer to D-II). In total, 10 out of 11 possible returnees are back. Understand: This kind of retention scenario will present itself maybe two or three times at the non-military mid-major level moving forward. A really good story is brewing here. Four players returned who averaged double figures, led by Christian May and Dylan Williamson. In total, 81% of the team's scoring returns and Skerry probably will go 10-deep well into league play. To me, the narrow favorites over Charleston in a competitive top end of the CAA. I dithered between FAU or UNT as the last team from the American in the back of the Top 100 And 1. I'll lean Mean Green due to not having a coaching change and the program ranking top-90 in multiple metrics four years running. Due to losing four starters, the Mean Green probably take a step back, but Ross Hodge's defensive scheme is going to ensure this team is second tier at worst in the AAC. Hodge is a top-10 (maybe top-five) defensive coach in the country. But without a threatening scorer, things get problematic. I think the name to watch is Atin Wright, a transfer from Drake who can shoot from deep and is going to be North Texas' spreader on offense. It's easy to overlook a team that wins by committee the way UNT has in recent years, but until I see results that justify putting this program outside the top 101, I won't do it. The Nittany Lions have five seniors back. Ace Baldwin is probably going to destroy opposing guards' spirits with almost every assignment he gets. That guy is worth the price of admission. No, PSU doesn't have great basketball history, but Mike Rhoades' track record (389-206 in his career, including a decade in D-III) suggests this team is being underrated heading into the season. Again, the Big Ten is such a foggy set of circumstances, but something tells me Rhoades' team will play spoiler on multiple nights this season. Over the past 20 years, with only a few exceptions, the MVC has placed at least three teams in the top 100 of a variety of metrics by season's end. I think 2025 will sustain the pattern. I've got Bradley in the top 50, Northern Iowa 16 spots north of this, and now we welcome the Murray State Racers back into the top-100 club. The team is one of my picks for one of the biggest turnarounds in the sport. Steve Prohm's program won only 12 games last season. So, why so much faith? Eight juniors and seniors will take up the entirety of the rotation, with a reasonable expectation that this will be a top-two defense in the Valley. At the 1 is JaCobi Wood, who won't exactly be Ja Morant, but I think he's poised to be one of only a handful of guys in D-I to average 15/5/5. If it all comes together, he could do that and creep up on 40% shooting from 3-point range. It would be easy to dismiss OSU after a lackluster run at the end of Mike Boynton's tenure, a subsequent coaching hire and inevitable massive roster flip. But the new coach is Steve Lutz, who has made the past three NCAA tourneys while at Texas A&M-Corpus Christi and Western Kentucky. He's a really good coach and previously worked under Matt Painter at Purdue and Greg McDermott at Creighton. Most importantly, Lutz wound up recruiting one of the oldest rosters in high-major ball, which I expect to translate to a solid Year 1. The familiar name is Bryce Thompson, who opted to stick it out in Stillwater after Boynton's departure. The new name is Devo Davis, who can be hit-or-miss but needs to hit big to give the Cowboys a spoiler's chance in the 16-team Big 12. The Buffaloes are losing a lot. The most talented team in program history, essentially. Gone: Tristan da Silva, KJ Simpson, Cody Williams, all NBA picks, two of them first rounders. And Eddie Lampkin Jr. is gone as well. Tad Boyle's had some really good years with lowered expectations. Let's see if he can pull off another one here, because it looks to be a tough slog ahead as Colorado transitions into the Big 12. It's anyone's guess as to who steps up in a starring role, but the candidates are Washington State transfer Andrej Jakimovski and top returning reserve Julian Hammond III. On a side note, I'm not sure there's a greater personality disparity in coaches at the high-major level than Deion Sanders and Tad Boyle. Frank Martin won 15 games in Year 1, 20 last season, so why not sign up for the Minutemen to be near the top of the A-10? It's an ambitious forecast, but Martin's force of will tends to have his rosters outperform expectations. Simply put, there will be 10-15 teams that easily rank top-100 come March but that can't be found inside the preseason top 100 at any predictive metrics site today. I'll go with UMass as one of those teams. Shooting guard Rahsool Diggins is back; expect him to drop 15 points per night. Sophomore point guard Jaylen Curry should shine. This is UMass' final season in the A-10, by the way. The school idiotically voted to leave and chase ill-fated football dreams in the MAC starting in 2025, a decision that's alienated a heavy portion of the school's alumni base. It's fair to say Bobby Hurley is in a hot-seat season, due to the new-look Big 12 and the fact ASU has finished sub-.500 in three of the past four years. If 2025 doesn't include an NCAA bid, change could be in the offing. And so, in comes the highest-rated frosh class of Hurley's career. One of the surprise roster additions of the offseason was ASU landing five-star Jayden Quaintance, who could help prove this ranking too dismissive. Best of all, due to his age, he's not eligible to be drafted until 2026. It's not just Quaintance; ASU also got a football-style flip in Joson Sanon, who balked on his commitment to Arizona and took to Tempe. I've got the Sun Devils low, however, because relying on freshmen and portal adds from the mid-major ranks (Missouri State's Alston Mason and Milwaukee's BJ Freeman are expected to be prominently featured) could be a challenging playbook in the best league in the country. The Cornhuskers are coming off only their second NCAA Tournament bid since 1998. This was a sweet story last season, but the bounce-back could be difficult. Keisei Tominaga's off conquering the world these days; the sport will miss him so. Critically, Rienk Mast is out for the season because of a knee injury. That lowers NU's ceiling due to Mast's vastly underrated skillset. Look for returnees Brice Williams and Juwan Gary to be high-leverage, positionless-type players, though maximizing their success could be attached to Utah transfer point guard Rollie Worster, who missed much of last season to injury. So there's your widespread preview. Want more hoops previews? We've got a lot in stock already. To start, head here for our preseason All-America teams and our preseason awards. If you want even more detailed previews of the high-major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12 and the SEC) and a best-of-the-rest lookahead outside the power leagues. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Title: From Tariffs to Taxes to Tyranny, Hollywood Braces for the Possibility of a Donald Trump Victory

Director Ali Abbasi basked in the applause, confident that the eight-minute standing ovation “The Apprentice” was enjoying in Cannes last May meant that his six-year gamble to bring the film to the screen was about to pay off. The movie, a look at Donald Trump’s early years as a real estate developer and his friendship with Roy Cohn, was scouting for distribution. Armed with this kind of reception, Abbasi believed he would soon have Netflix, or one of the prominent indie studios, knocking on his door. But though “The Apprentice” drew interest from the usual suspects, there were no offers — not even a lowball one. The film, which depicts Trump getting liposuction, abusing amphetamines, running his casino into the ground and raping his first wife, Ivana, was simply too hot to handle. With Trump locked in a tight race for the White House, major studios, indie labels and streamers, or at least their corporate parents, couldn’t risk alienating the once and possibly future king. Related Stories VIP+ New Live Music Data Suggests Cautious Optimism ‘Disorder,' Anthology Film Depicting Turbulent Life in Lebanon, Acquired for World Sales by Front Row Ahead of El Gouna Fest Premiere “I get it,” Abbasi says. “This guy can become the next president, and he will have all these tools at his disposal, which he’s shown a willingness to use. So he can come after you with all these regulations and taxes.” he adds, “But it still upsets me.” Popular on Variety Abbasi’s experience says a lot about the anxiety gripping the entertainment world as it watches a tumultuous, enormously consequential election unfold. From corporate suites to studio lots, Hollywood is bracing for a possible Trump return, one that could bring chaos and deepen political divisions in a polarized country. “There’s a lot of nervousness,” says Schuyler M. Moore, a partner at Greenberg Glusker, who practices entertainment, corporate and tax law. “They don’t know exactly what he would do if he got back in power.” The actors, writers and directors who make most of what Hollywood exports are overwhelmingly supportive of Kamala Harris and view Trump as an existential threat to their freedoms. They speak at rallies for the Democratic nominee, host fundraisers and make personal contributions. And they’re terrified about what Trump would mean for everything from abortion access to environmental protections — to say nothing of the frontal assault on the rule of law he seems hell-bent on waging. “Everything’s at stake,” says Sarah Paulson, the Emmy- and Tony-winning actress and a Harris supporter. “Democracy is on the ballot.” But the people who sign Paulson and other artists’ checks have complicated loyalties — they seem more worried about making money than maintaining democratic norms. For them, a second Trump term would mean lower taxes and less antitrust enforcement, a key attraction for a debt-ridden industry looking to consolidate. They are banking on Trump behaving like a generic Republican by embracing a pro-business agenda. But Trump has been less interested in ideology and more attracted to a politics of personal grievance, one that rewards sycophants and punishes critics. Trump’s erratic behavior in his first term made it difficult for companies to figure out how to navigate his administration without offending him. Despite that challenge, his policies were often good for corporate bottom lines. In 2017, Trump signed a massive tax cut, lowering corporate rates from 35% to 21%. The bill included benefits that were especially helpful to Hollywood, including a lowered rate on overseas income and the ability to immediately write off the full cost of film and TV productions. Disney and Comcast each saved more than $6 billion in the following four years, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. If elected to a second term, Trump has vowed to cut the corporate rate even further — to 15% for companies that make their products in the U.S. Harris, in contrast, wants to hike the rate to 28% and increase the tax on overseas income. Regardless of who wins, the Motion Picture Association, which represents seven Hollywood studios, is already seeking to influence the next tax law. In a Sept. 25 letter, the lobbying group urged Congress to preserve the benefits of the Trump tax cut, arguing that it “led to a profound increase in film and television production and ownership in the U.S.” On the other hand, Trump has targeted companies that own news operations, sometimes in performative ways, but sometimes with genuine consequences. In the last month, he has threatened to pull the broadcast licenses of CBS and Disney’s ABC over their coverage, and he is currently suing ABC. He has threatened to investigate Comcast for “treason” over NBC’s coverage of the Russia scandal. And in 2017, his Justice Department sued to block AT&T from acquiring Time Warner, which some saw as retaliation against CNN for its coverage of his campaign and presidency. Looking ahead, Trump has pledged to use his office to prosecute opponents. Since many media conglomerates operate news divisions and produce late-night shows that investigate, criticize or lampoon Trump, that could make them a legal and political target for a president obsessed with personal retribution. “I could see him asking Republicans to pass a law saying anything anti-government is treasonous,” says Moore. “And I could also see him trying to upend current defamation law, so it becomes much easier to go after people. That could have a chilling effect on free speech.” Moore faults companies for being too enamored of the tax cuts that Trump is proposing and insufficiently fearful of his authoritarian impulses. “He’s not kidding around,” he says. “I’m not sure how great it would be for them to live in a country without a functional democracy.” Those darker predictions may not come to pass, but whoever wins the Oval Office will have to deal with a media industry that’s desperate to keep merging. And since the next president’s administration will be tasked with enforcing antitrust law, that will give either Trump or Harris enormous power over Hollywood’s future. The Biden administration has antagonized Wall Street by appointing enforcers — Lina Khan at the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter, anti-trust division chief at the Justice Department — who have targeted corporate power, especially in tech. Critics argue that has had a chilling effect. “They created an environment that made dealmaking more difficult,” says Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. “They’ve scared away deals.” It’s not obvious which administration would be better for companies. Kovacic assumes that Trump would back off on the Biden approach, though he adds, “if you’re a company he hates, he’s not beyond revenge.” Harris, meanwhile, sued several companies on antitrust grounds when she was California attorney general. But she was reluctant to take big swings at the tech industry, according to a memoir by Kathleen Foote, the longtime chief of the AG’s antitrust section. Kovacic says Harris might go a little easier than Biden, but in a subtle way, so as not to rile her left flank. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren recently urged the Justice Department to scrutinize Venu, the new sports streaming venture from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, saying it would raise subscription prices across the industry. If Harris is elected, Sanders and Warren are likely to keep up the pressure on her administration on that and similar issues. Warner Bros. Discovery is struggling under a massive debt load, and another merger may be its only means of survival. At the Allen & Co. conference in July, CEO David Zaslav didn’t endorse a candidate, but said he hoped the next administration will see the benefits of consolidation. “We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to, to be even better,” he said. The Hollywood unions have supported the Biden approach, arguing that media consolidation suppresses wages and results in layoffs. “The Biden administration has been the most pro-labor administration we’ve seen in our lifetimes,” says Matthew Loeb, the president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 65,000 Hollywood workers and has endorsed Harris. “It was an easy call for us,” Loeb says. Entertainment companies also face the risk of an all-out trade war. Hollywood is an export business, but many studios belong to companies such as Sony and Apple that also import electronics and other goods to the U.S. Trump has promised a 10% tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on goods coming from China. That would unleash “chaos” in a global marketplace, says Ed Brzytwa, the VP of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association. “All the agreements, rules and norms will start to unravel,” he says. Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in 2018, most of which Biden retained. They amounted to a $32 billion levy on electronic goods through 2021, according to Brzytwa’s group. The Consumer Technology Association — whose members include Sony, Disney, Amazon and Comcast — argues that the tariffs failed to revive U.S. manufacturing, but did push production to other Asian countries, like Vietnam and Taiwan. In 2022, Sony Electronics moved much of its camera production to Thailand. Harris would likely maintain the Biden approach, using targeted tariffs more aggressively than under previous Democratic administrations. Trump’s overall tariff rates would be seven times higher than the current level, according to the Tax Foundation. If he follows through, prices would rise, and the resulting drop in demand, for many companies, would outweigh any gains from lower tax rates, Brzytwa says. “I think there is a lot of interest in the corporate world in preserving what was accomplished in the [Trump tax bill],” he says. “But they don’t want a situation where the U.S. is a fortress and is closed off from the world.” Brzytwa warns that other countries would likely retaliate, making life more difficult for exporters — even entertainment producers. Media giants shoot all over the world, taking advantage of foreign subsidies. They employ creative talent overseas, and release movies and television shows to vast international regions, where they hope to drive future growth. Trump’s protectionist policies could disrupt that. They would threaten to reframe America’s role in the global economy, straining alliances and fracturing trade partnerships. The consequences of those actions would be felt in almost every sector of the economy. “You have someone in Trump with the potential to blow it all up,” says Tina Fordham, the founder of Fordham Global Foresight and an expert on geopolitical risk. “If the rules of the game and international norms aren’t respected, then the U.S. will no longer be treated as a reliable global trading partner. That means all the advantages that America has enjoyed in the post-World War II era could erode. I’m not sure people appreciate how destabilizing this could be.” Some of that impact is already being felt. A decade ago, Hollywood was still focused on opening the Chinese market to American films. But that initiative faded away as the relationship soured. “That ship has sailed,” says Greg Frazier, who worked on the issue while at the MPA. “Whether it’s Harris or Trump, I don’t see any great opening in China, on either side.” As for “The Apprentice,” after months in limbo, the producers finally signed a deal with Briarcliff Entertainment, a tiny distribution company that has handled politically charged fare such as “The Dissident,” a 2020 documentary about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi that also scared off major media outlets. “It was such a relief to get into theaters,” Abbasi says. “I spent the summer clinically depressed and thinking, ‘We did all this work, and nobody is ever going to see our film.’” Instead, “The Apprentice” opened in theaters on Oct. 11, a month before a presidential election that could return Trump to the pinnacle of power. Abbasi is glad that someone had the courage to release his movie, but he won’t forget the fear he encountered while trying to get “The Apprentice” in front of audiences. “The big story for me is how one human being is intimidating the 300 million or so people who live in America,” Abbasi says. “How can an entire country let that happen?” Jack Dunn contributed to this report.

On Thursday, JPMorgan reaffirmed its Overweight rating on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM), following the company's third-quarter earnings report, which surpassed expectations. The semiconductor giant reported gross margins (GM) of 57.8%, significantly higher than the anticipated mid-point guidance of 54.5% and JPMorgan's estimate of 54.8%. Moreover, TSMC provided an optimistic fourth-quarter revenue growth forecast of 13% quarter over quarter, indicating a potential further increase in gross margins. The improvement in gross margins for the second half of 2024 is attributed to better utilization rates, with N5 and N3 technology nodes operating at full capacity, and productivity gains. These positive factors have helped mitigate the challenges posed by the transition from N5 to N3 technology and increases in power tariffs. TSMC also projects that the growth in artificial intelligence (AI) will sustain for several years, driven by robust demand from hyperscaler customers and the development of practical applications. This outlook suggests the likelihood of an ongoing semiconductor industry upcycle. JPMorgan's analysis points to a potential near-term rise in TSMC's stock value, particularly in light of the company's strong guidance and margin trajectory. This outlook comes as a reassurance to investors, especially after recent concerns about potential weaknesses in the semiconductor sector following disappointing news from ASML (AS:ASML). In other recent news, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) reported robust third-quarter sales, surpassing both their own and market estimates. This success is attributed to the strong performance of TSMC's advanced nodes, particularly as the 3nm technology continues to gain traction. HSBC, BofA Securities, and Bernstein SocGen Group have all maintained positive ratings on TSMC, highlighting the company's strong financial performance and future potential. TSMC's revenue reached TWD760 billion, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter. The semiconductor giant is expected to achieve a gross margin of 55.5% for the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of 54.7%. The precise details regarding the company's financial performance will be clarified during TSMC's third-quarter earnings call. TSMC displayed robust performance in Q2 of 2024, with a 13.6% sequential revenue increase and a gross margin rise to 53.2%. The High-Performance Computing (HPC) segment accounted for 52% of total revenue. Furthermore, TSMC raised its full-year revenue guidance to a growth rate slightly above the mid-20s percent in USD terms. The company's capital expenditure for 2024 is projected to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion, primarily allocated to advanced process technologies. These are among the recent developments for TSMC as the company continues to solidify its position in the semiconductor industry. The company's advanced technologies and strategic investments have been recognized by several analyst firms, highlighting its potential for continued growth and success. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, aligning with JPMorgan's optimistic outlook. According to InvestingPro data, TSM's revenue growth has been impressive, with a 40.07% increase in the most recent quarter. This robust growth supports the company's positive fourth-quarter forecast mentioned in the article. The company's profitability metrics are equally noteworthy. TSM boasts a healthy gross profit margin of 53.36% for the last twelve months, which is consistent with the strong gross margins reported in the third quarter. Moreover, the operating income margin stands at a remarkable 42.04%, indicating efficient operations and cost management. InvestingPro Tips highlight TSM's strong dividend performance, with a dividend growth of 42.34% over the last twelve months. This substantial increase in dividends reflects the company's financial health and commitment to shareholder returns, which may be particularly appealing to investors in the current market environment.

We recently published a list of 12 Most Profitable Growth Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) stands against other most profitable growth stocks to invest in. After the September inflation report, the market did feel a slight bit of panic but it seems to be fading away. After the report, the market expectations for a rate cut shifted, with 79.9% of participants predicting a cut to 450-475 basis points, while 20.1% expect the rates to remain unchanged. It was a change from 32.1% expecting a 50 bps rate cut and 67.9% anticipating a 25 bps cut at the beginning of the month as mentioned in our 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest in article. However, on October 11, the CME FedWatch tool showed that 89.5% of the market now expects a 25 bps rate cut and the rest expect it to remain the same. Christian Mueller-Glissmann from Goldman Sachs joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the latest market trends. He believes that the stock market pullback in August could be a warning of more potential corrections, but he does not see a severe bear market ahead. His overall outlook is positive due to a healthy macroeconomic environment, where growth remains stable, inflation is under control, and central banks are starting to reduce rates. These factors create a favorable setting for equities and other risk assets. He pointed out that while bullish market positioning contributed to August’s setback, the combination of declining inflation and rate cuts allows central banks to cushion against financial shocks, minimizing the risk of a deep downturn. Mueller-Glissmann highlighted two key reasons for not expecting a major market decline: inflation has significantly dropped, giving central banks more flexibility, and price momentum over the past 6-12 months suggests a strong macroeconomic backdrop. With the labor market improving, he sees no signs of an economic downturn. His strategy focuses on quality growth stocks that are temporarily undervalued and cyclical value stocks that could recover as the market stabilizes. Regarding inflation, he noted a shift from inflation relief to growth as the main market driver, raising concerns about inflation resurfacing if growth strengthens. However, he remains confident that inflation will stay anchored, and disinflation will continue into the year’s end.

Title: A billionaire investor sold his Nvidia shares. It was a 'big mistake', he says

Time Published: 2024-10-17T12:50:00Z

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller admits he has made more than a few mistakes in his career. Selling his Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) shares earlier this year was one of them. In an interview with Bloomberg TV Wednesday, Druckenmiller said he sold all of his Nvidia holdings when the stock was priced somewhere between $800 and $950. “It was a big mistake,” Druckenmiller, chief executive of Duquesne Family Office, said. Nvidia carried out a 10-for-1 stock split in June, when its shares were near a then-record of $1,200 apiece. Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company were up 3% in pre-market trading as of Thursday morning, set to open at $139.82 each. Despite some volatility, Nvidia’s stock is up more than 180% so far this year — and is on track to reach another record high this week. The chip giant now has a market capitalization of $3.33 trillion, the second-largest in the world behind Apple (AAPL+1.23%). While the investor had hoped to hold onto his shares of the chipmaker “for years,” Druckenmiller thought the valuation was rich after the stock tripled in a year. “I think Nvidia is a wonderful company and were the price to come down we’d get involved again,” Druckenmiller said. “But right now, I’m licking my wounds from a bad sale there.” Druckenmiller said that despite the pullback from Nvidia, he remains optimistic about artificial intelligence. He said his investment firm is eyeing other ways to keep his foot in the door in the booming sector. The investor has a net worth of $9.98 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. While Nvidia isn’t set to report its latest quarterly earnings until late November, Taiwain Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM-2.43%) (TSMC) strong results Thursday have helped fuel confidence that the AI boom could extend into next year and beyond. Earlier this month, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for its highly-anticipated Blackwell chip is “insane.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

On Thursday, Mizuho Securities sustained its positive stance on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META), lifting its price target to $650 from the previous $600 while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock. The adjustment comes as the firm's checks on advertising spending reveal performance surpassing the consensus and reaching the higher end of the company's guidance, which anticipates a 20% year-over-year growth. The analyst at Mizuho highlighted the additional revenue potential stemming from political advertising. Despite the expectation that capital expenditures (capex) might rise following the second-quarter guidance of a 37% year-over-year increase, it was noted that Meta has operational expenditure (opex) flexibility that could balance the heightened depreciation costs. In justification of the new price target, Mizuho increased its target multiple for Meta's fiscal year 2026 enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA) to 13 times, up from 12 times. This adjustment reflects the high end of the stock's historical range. The analyst expressed confidence in Meta's ability to outperform expectations, suggesting that it could surpass forecasts and raise future guidance, citing significant potential in its messaging services and generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) for creative purposes. The analyst's remarks also touched on the current market sentiment, describing Meta's stock as a "crowded trade into the print." This suggests that many investors may be anticipating positive results. Nonetheless, the analyst's outlook implies that Meta stands out among major tech companies for its potential to exceed expectations and offer promising developments in technology. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has initiated strategic adjustments impacting Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs teams. The company has been streamlining teams to align with long-term goals and location strategy, with some employees being relocated and others reassigned. Meta has also been facing legal challenges, with a federal judge ordering the company to confront lawsuits alleging that its social media platforms contribute to addiction among teenagers. Meanwhile, several financial firms have offered positive outlooks on Meta's future. Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Meta, suggesting continued aggressive investment in infrastructure due to the AI arms race. Stifel raised its price target for Meta to $663, citing strong momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Roth/MKM also raised the stock's price target to $620, reflecting optimism in the company's medium and long-term prospects. Finally, Meta has made strides in combating disinformation, dismantling a network of fake accounts targeting users in Moldova ahead of the country's presidential election and EU membership referendum. These are the recent developments involving Meta Platforms. Meta Platforms Inc.'s strong financial position and market performance align well with Mizuho Securities' bullish outlook. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a market capitalization of $1.46 trillion, reflecting its dominant position in the tech sector. The company's impressive revenue growth of 24.28% over the last twelve months supports Mizuho's expectation of continued strong performance. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's financial strength, noting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and has "liquid assets exceed short term obligations." These factors contribute to Meta's financial flexibility, which could be crucial as the company navigates potential increases in capital expenditures, as mentioned in the Mizuho analysis. Furthermore, Meta's "impressive gross profit margins" of 81.49% underscore its operational efficiency, potentially allowing for the opex flexibility that Mizuho suggests could offset higher depreciation costs. The company's strong profitability is further evidenced by its high return on assets of 23.54%. For investors seeking more comprehensive insights, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips for Meta Platforms Inc., providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: ‘I guarantee it’: Donald Trump vows no state in America will be allowed to ban gas-powered cars

Time Published: 2024-10-17T12:04:00Z

In recent years, electric vehicles have gained significant traction in the U.S. And several states are moving to accelerate the transition by planning bans on the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles in the near future. California was the first state to adopt the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which dictates that, “by 2035 all new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in California will be zero emissions.” Governor Gavin Newsom emphasized the urgency, stating that cars “shouldn’t melt glaciers or raise sea levels.” Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how But California isn’t standing alone. So far, 11 other states have followed suit, setting their sights on phasing out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. However, this sweeping shift doesn’t sit well with former President Donald Trump. Speaking at a rally in Saginaw, Michigan, the Republican presidential nominee declared, “When I'm president, no state in America will be permitted to ban gas powered cars or trucks, and I guarantee it — no way, no way. You're going to make them right here.” The crowd erupted in cheers. Despite the growing buzz around EVs, they still represent a relatively small piece of the U.S. auto market. Kelley Blue Book estimated that in 2023, the EV share of the total U.S. vehicle market was 7.6%. If Trump wins the election and succeeds in halting state-level bans on gas-powered cars, the automotive landscape could shift dramatically. Here’s a look at three stocks that could benefit from this potential move — stocks that Wall Street already finds attractive. Ford has been making headlines with its push toward electrification, rolling out models like the Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric SUV, and the F-150 Lightning, an electric version of its iconic pickup truck. However, the company’s core business remains tied to traditional combustion engines. In 2023, Ford says it sold 1,995,912 vehicles, but only 72,608 were EVs. Financially, the EV segment has been a challenge. According to a report in Bloomberg, Ford’s losses per electric vehicle exceeded $100,000 in the first quarter of 2024, prompting the company to cut battery supplier orders. To recalibrate, Ford is pivoting production at its Oakville, Ontario plant. Originally slated for electric SUV production, the plant will be prioritizing its high-demand F-Series Super Duty trucks. If Trump prevents states from banning gas-powered cars, Ford could continue thriving in the truck and SUV market, especially given the F-Series status as America’s best-selling vehicle. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney has a “buy” rating on Ford and a price target of $13, implying a potential upside of 20%. Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead General Motors, like Ford, has heavily invested in EVs while still leaning on its profitable lineup of gas-powered cars, SUVs and trucks, including popular models like the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. In June, GM reportedly announced plans to scale back its EV production target for 2024, reducing expectations to between 200,000 and 250,000 vehicles, down from a previous estimate of up to 300,000. At its recent investor day, GM projected it would close the year producing “about 200,000” EVs, at the low end of its revised guidance. Meanwhile, the company has said it expects operating losses in its EV segment to shrink by $2 billion to $4 billion in 2025. GM sold 75,883 EVs last year — only 2.9% of the company’s total sales. CNBC noted that “a vast majority of those” of those sales came from GM's now-discontinued Chevrolet Bolt models. If Trump’s proposed policies slow the shift to EVs, GM could continue to capitalize on its established and profitable gas-powered lineups. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has an “outperform” rating on GM and a price target of $55 — 13% above where the stock sits today. Exxon Mobil is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. It’s also a familiar name to drivers of gasoline-powered vehicles, with more than 11,000 gas stations across the U.S. Business is highly lucrative. In 2023, the company generated $36.0 billion in profits and $55.4 billion in cash flow from operating activities. The company’s profitability translates to strong shareholder returns. In 2023, Exxon returned $32.4 billion to investors, including $14.9 billion in dividends and $17.4 billion in stock buybacks. With its entrenched position in traditional energy, Exxon stands to benefit if gas-powered cars continue to dominate American roads. A policy preventing states from banning gasoline vehicles could sustain fuel demand, allowing Exxon to leverage its vast infrastructure and extensive oil reserves. Exxon shares have already surged 18% in 2024, and UBS analyst Josh Silverstein sees further upside on the horizon. Silverstein has a “Buy” rating on Exxon and a price target of $149 — roughly 24% above the current levels.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) (TSMC), the world’s largest chipmaker, saw its profits soar 54% in the third quarter, driven by continued demand for its artificial intelligence-capable chips. The Taiwan-based company reported Thursday $23.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 36% from a year ago and topping Wall Street’s expectations. Net income came in at $10.1 billion, also blowing past estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). “Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,” said Wendell Huang, chief financial officer of TSMC. “Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.” TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 9% in Thursday morning trading following the earnings report. Huang had previously said that the company expected smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. Looking ahead, TSMC chief C.C. Wei has said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. Wedbush analysts say the company could keep riding this high for a long while. In a note Thursday titled “No End in Sight to AI Derived Strength,” analysts, led by Matt Bryson, said the third-quarter results give more confidence to views that TSMC will be able to continue growing gross margins. TSMC’s gross margins were 58% for the quarter. The analysts expect AI chip revenues to more than triple in 2024 and account for around a mid-teens percentage of TSMC’s revenues. For the fourth quarter, TSMC estimates that its revenue will come in between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion — a multi-billion dollar increase from last quarter. It’s projecting gross profit margin of 57.0% to 59.0%, consistent with the third quarter or slightly higher. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia hit a record high amid a rally in U.S. chip stocks on Thursday after industry bellwether TSMC's strong sales forecast boosted investor optimism about demand for processors used to power artificial intelligence applications. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its expectation for annual revenue growth and said sales from AI chips would account for mid-teen percentage of its full-year revenue. U.S.-listed TSMC shares rose more than 11%, lifting the company's market capitalization above $1 trillion. The forecast from the leading producer of advanced AI chips reinforced investor confidence in the outlook for chipmakers whose market values have skyrocketed in the past two years due to a surge in chip spending by Big Tech. TSMC customer and AI chip frontrunner Nvidia rose almost 4% to a record high of $140.89, before paring gains to trade 2% higher in afternoon trade. Smaller rival AMD gained nearly 1%, with Broadcom, Qualcomm and Micron gaining between 1% and 3.6%. "Nvidia is one of TSMC's major customers, so there is a direct read-across to the American chip firm in the Taiwanese company's results," said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. Struggling chipmaker Intel's shares also rose 1%. Intel has been expanding its chip fabrication facilities in an attempt to challenge TSMC in advanced contract manufacturing — an undertaking analysts expect will take years. TSMC's outlook also offered some respite to investors after deep forecast cuts from chipmaking equipment giant ASML sparked fears of a slower-than-expected recovery in demand for semiconductors not used in AI. "Fortunately, everything is fine in AI land," Coatsworth said. "TSMC said demand was strong for both AI-related business and from smartphones, implying that the chip sector still has momentum." TSMC's U.S.-listed shares have doubled this year, while Nvidia has surged 180%, as investors pour billions of dollars into chip stocks amid Wall Street's booming picks-and-shovels trade.

U.S.-listed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) shares jumped 9% Thursday morning after the chipmaker posted robust quarterly earnings and projected a buoyant outlook on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The company, which supplies tech heavyweights such as Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), reported a 54% year-over-year rise in third-quarter net income of 325.26 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.12 billion), up from NT$211 billion. The profit figure by the world's largest contract chip manufacturer beat the NT$300.78 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. TSMC also reported a 39% jump in revenue to NT$759.69 billion ($23.64 billion) for the quarter and a 57.8% gross margin, above analysts' estimates and the guidance it gave for both in the second quarter. "Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies," TSMC Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Wendell Huang said. "Moving into fourth quarter 2024, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies." TSMC's upbeat earnings, in contrast to Dutch semiconductor-gear manufacturer ASML Holding's (ASML) downbeat outlook earlier in the week, restored investor faith in the AI boom Thursday. Shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) all rose. TSMC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) C.C. Wei called the demand for AI “real" in the earnings call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. TSMC American depositary receipts (ADRs) have almost doubled this year.UPDATE—Oct. 17, 2024: This article has been updated to include a comment from the CEO and a refreshed share price.

Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.8%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) added 0.4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) held near a record high logged as the major gauges rebounded to close with gains.

TSMC's US-listed shares climbed 8% in premarket trading, helping spur a rally chip stocks including Arm (ARM), up 3.6%, Nvidia, and Broadcom (AVGO). On the data front, a monthly report on retail sales due later could show whether the economy is reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. A weekly reading on jobless claims is also on the docket, similarly watched by investors debating whether the Federal Reserve will hold off from cutting interest rates in November.

Strong retail sales data also helped lift the major averages. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flatline to hold near record highs after the major averages rebounded to close with gains. Contract chipmaker TSMC posted a 54% jump in quarterly profit to beat Wall Street estimates and raised its forecast for 2024 revenue growth amid surging AI demand. The outlook boost from the main chipmaker for Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) reassured a market spooked by ASML's (ASML) downbeat sales forecast, reviving hopes for an AI boom. TSMC's US-listed shares climbed 8%, poised to cross a $1 trillion market valuation if the gains hold in the regular session. Its forecast helped spur a rally chip stocks including Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Nvidia. On the data front, retail sales jumped 0.4%, more than the 0.3% rise expected, giving credence to the argument the economy could be reaccelerating following a surprisingly strong September jobs report. Weekly jobless claims came in at 241,000, far below expectations, and a drop from the prior week's upwardly revised 260,000. The data released Thursday morning was watched by investors debating whether the Federal Reserve will hold off from cutting interest rates in November. After a stellar showing by big banks, the focus is now on Big Tech earnings to wipe away the disappointments of the last quarter. After the bell, Netflix becomes the first "Magnificent Seven" megacap to report, with Wall Street on watch for price-hike news to potentially lift the stock. The major averages rose on Thursday with tech stocks leading the gains after chipmaker TSMC's (TSM) upbeat outlook helped send the semiconductor sector higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%. Strong economic data also helped lift stocks. September's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% — a sharp increase from August's 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000. September's retail sales rose 0.4% versus estimates of 0.3% — a sharp acceleration off August's 0.1% growth. Meanwhile, jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 12 came in at 241,000, versus estimates of 259,000. The prior week's reading was revised up to 260,000. The data released Thursday morning gives fuel to the argument that the economy could be reaccelerating following a strong September jobs report. Investors were watching the data for clues on what the Federal Reserve's interest rate move will be at the next FOMC meeting in November. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) surged 9.6% in premarket trading, putting the stock in position for an all-time high after its third-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates. TSMC recorded a 54% jump in profit and raised its full-year revenue outlook. TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia (NVDA) and its rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as well as Broadcom (AVGO) and many other tech firms. Nvidia shares jumped 3%, AMD rose 2.7%, and Broadcom jumped 2.8% premarket on the news. Here's a look at TSMC's results: Adjusted earnings per share of 12.54 New Taiwan dollars ($0.39) versus NT$11.55 ($0.36) expected Revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.5 billion) versus NT$751.1 billion ($23.3 billion) expected The chip stocks' rally partially reverses the sector's losses earlier this week, driven by fears over potential further US trade restrictions and a gloomy report from semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML. Analysts at Needham, Bernstein, Barclays, and other investment firms reiterated their buy ratings on TSM stock on Thursday morning. Of the Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg who cover the company, some 23 recommend buying the stock, while only one analyst has a Hold rating. On average, analysts see shares rising to about $217 each over the next 12 months, per Bloomberg data.

(NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00.1.Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures.2.Earnings per diluted share ("EPS"). Elevance Health Consolidated Enterprise Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$44.7 $42.5 $43.2 Operating Gain1,2$1.4 $1.8 $2.8 Adjusted Operating Gain1,3$2.4 $2.5 $2.8 Operating Margin13.1 % 4.1 % 6.4 % Adjusted Operating Margin1,35.3 % 6.0 % 6.6 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.2.Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, include items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation."3.Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein.Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Health Benefits is comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard ®, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses. Health Benefits Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$38.3 $36.7 $37.2 Operating Gain1$1.6 $1.8 $2.1 Operating Margin14.2 % 5.0 % 5.8 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Health Benefits segment operating revenue was $38.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1$0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin15.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2024.

Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables.Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.Elevance HealthEarnings Release Financial Schedules and Supplementary InformationQuarter & Year-to-Date Ended September 30, 2024Membership and Other MetricsQuarterly & Year-to-Date Consolidated Statements of IncomeCondensed Consolidated Balance SheetCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsSupplemental Financial Information - Reportable SegmentsSupplemental Financial Information - Reconciliation of Medical Claims PayableReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresElevance HealthMembership and Other Metrics(Unaudited) Change fromMedical Membership (in thousands)September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024Individual1,299 999 1,281 30.0 % 1.4 %Employer Group Risk-Based3,672 3,754 3,648 (2.2) % 0.7 %Commercial Risk-Based4,971 4,753 4,929 4.6 % 0.9 %BlueCard ®16,677 6,737 6,692 (0.9) % (0.2) %Employer Group Fee-Based20,589 20,166 20,542 2.1 % 0.2 %Commercial Fee-Based27,266 26,903 27,234 1.3 % 0.1 %Medicare Advantage2,047 2,064 2,031 (0.8) % 0.8 %Medicare Supplement894 928 894 (3.7) % ” %Total Medicare2,941 2,992 2,925 (1.7) % 0.5 %Medicaid8,926 11,018 9,028 (19.0) % (1.1) %Federal Employees Health Benefits1,656 1,640 1,660 1.0 % (0.2) %Total Medical Membership45,760 47,306 45,776 (3.3) % ” %Other Membership (in thousands) Dental Members7,021 6,775 7,008 3.6 % 0.2 %Dental Administration Members1,878 1,708 1,851 10.0 % 1.5 %Vision Members10,382 9,861 10,275 5.3 % 1.0 %Medicare Part D Standalone Members258 261 260 (1.1) % (0.8) %Other Metrics (in millions) CarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts80.2 77.3 78.2 3.8 % 2.6 %Carelon Services Consumers Served101.3 104.8 102.3 (3.3) % (1.0) % 1.BlueCard ® membership for the three months ended September 30, 2023, is restated to align to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association reporting methodology.

(NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00.1.Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures.2.Earnings per diluted share ("EPS"). Elevance Health Consolidated Enterprise Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$44.7 $42.5 $43.2 Operating Gain1,2$1.4 $1.8 $2.8 Adjusted Operating Gain1,3$2.4 $2.5 $2.8 Operating Margin13.1 % 4.1 % 6.4 % Adjusted Operating Margin1,35.3 % 6.0 % 6.6 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.2.Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, include items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation."3.Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein.Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Health Benefits is comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard ®, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses. Health Benefits Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$38.3 $36.7 $37.2 Operating Gain1$1.6 $1.8 $2.1 Operating Margin14.2 % 5.0 % 5.8 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Health Benefits segment operating revenue was $38.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1$0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin15.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2024.

Basis of PresentationOperating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables.Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.Elevance HealthEarnings Release Financial Schedules and Supplementary InformationQuarter & Year-to-Date Ended September 30, 2024Membership and Other MetricsQuarterly & Year-to-Date Consolidated Statements of IncomeCondensed Consolidated Balance SheetCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsSupplemental Financial Information - Reportable SegmentsSupplemental Financial Information - Reconciliation of Medical Claims PayableReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresElevance HealthMembership and Other Metrics(Unaudited) Change fromMedical Membership (in thousands)September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024Individual1,299 999 1,281 30.0 % 1.4 %Employer Group Risk-Based3,672 3,754 3,648 (2.2) % 0.7 %Commercial Risk-Based4,971 4,753 4,929 4.6 % 0.9 %BlueCard ®16,677 6,737 6,692 (0.9) % (0.2) %Employer Group Fee-Based20,589 20,166 20,542 2.1 % 0.2 %Commercial Fee-Based27,266 26,903 27,234 1.3 % 0.1 %Medicare Advantage2,047 2,064 2,031 (0.8) % 0.8 %Medicare Supplement894 928 894 (3.7) % ” %Total Medicare2,941 2,992 2,925 (1.7) % 0.5 %Medicaid8,926 11,018 9,028 (19.0) % (1.1) %Federal Employees Health Benefits1,656 1,640 1,660 1.0 % (0.2) %Total Medical Membership45,760 47,306 45,776 (3.3) % ” %Other Membership (in thousands) Dental Members7,021 6,775 7,008 3.6 % 0.2 %Dental Administration Members1,878 1,708 1,851 10.0 % 1.5 %Vision Members10,382 9,861 10,275 5.3 % 1.0 %Medicare Part D Standalone Members258 261 260 (1.1) % (0.8) %Other Metrics (in millions) CarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts80.2 77.3 78.2 3.8 % 2.6 %Carelon Services Consumers Served101.3 104.8 102.3 (3.3) % (1.0) % 1.BlueCard ® membership for the three months ended September 30, 2023, is restated to align to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association reporting methodology.

These non-GAAP measures are intended to aid investors when comparing Elevance Health's financial results among periods and are not intended to be alternatives to any measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are available below. In addition to these non-GAAP measures, references are made to the measures Operating Revenue and Operating Gain/Loss, Operating Margin and Adjusted EPS. Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reportable segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Each of these measures is provided to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing Elevance Health's operating and financial results. A reconciliation of Operating Revenue to Total Revenue is set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income herein. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, together with a reconciliation of reportable segments operating gain to income before income tax expense, is provided below. Prior amounts may be grouped differently to conform to the current presentation. Net adjustment items per share may not sum due to rounding.

INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00. Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures. Earnings per diluted share ("EPS"). Elevance Health Consolidated Enterprise Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $44.7 $42.5 $43.2 Operating Gain1,2 $1.4 $1.8 $2.8 Adjusted Operating Gain1,3 $2.4 $2.5 $2.8 Operating Margin1 3.1 % 4.1 % 6.4 % Adjusted Operating Margin1,3 5.3 % 6.0 % 6.6 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, include items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation." Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein. Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Health Benefits is comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard ®, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses. Health Benefits Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $38.3 $36.7 $37.2 Operating Gain1 $1.6 $1.8 $2.1 Operating Margin1 4.2 % 5.0 % 5.8 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Health Benefits segment operating revenue was $38.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1 $0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin1 5.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2024.

Elevance Health GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited) This document references non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted Shareholders' Net Income, Adjusted Shareholders' Net Income Per Share, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Gain, Adjusted Operating Expense and Adjusted Operating Expense Ratio, which are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are intended to aid investors when comparing Elevance Health's financial results among periods and are not intended to be alternatives to any measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are available below. In addition to these non-GAAP measures, references are made to the measures Operating Revenue and Operating Gain/Loss, Operating Margin and Adjusted EPS. Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reportable segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Each of these measures is provided to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing Elevance Health's operating and financial results. A reconciliation of Operating Revenue to Total Revenue is set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income herein. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, together with a reconciliation of reportable segments operating gain to income before income tax expense, is provided below. Prior amounts may be grouped differently to conform to the current presentation. Net adjustment items per share may not sum due to rounding.

Title: Will Ford's Q3 Results Boost Its Underperforming Stock

GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 21: A Ford F-150 Lariat PowerBoost ybrid pickup truck is displayed for ... [+] sale at a Ford dealership on August 21, 2024 in Glendale, California. Ford announced it is upending its electric vehicle (EV) strategy for North American vehicles to focus on hybrids, affordability, and longer ranges. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Ford stock is expected to publish its Q3 2024 results in the coming weeks, reporting on a quarter that saw the company’s delivery growth slow considerably in the U.S. We expect Ford to report revenue of about $41.7 billion, marking a modest increase of about 1% compared to last year, while earnings are likely to come in at about $0.51 per share, slightly ahead of consensus estimates and up about 40% compared to last year. Now, Ford stock has underperformed this year, falling by about 7% year-to-date, compared to fellow U.S. auto giant GM which has gained close to 35% over the same period. So what are some of the trends that could drive Ford’s results for the quarter? See our analysis of Ford Earnings Preview for a closer look of the key drivers of Ford’s earnings. Ford’s U.S. sales increased slightly to 504,039 units in Q3, marking just a 1% rise compared to the 7% growth from the same period last year. High interest rates have made vehicle financing increasingly costly, curbing consumer demand. The pandemic-fueled pricing power automakers once enjoyed is also waning as U.S. consumer spending softens. Despite these headwinds, Ford outperformed the broader U.S. automotive market, which saw a 2% drop in volumes, driven in part by strong hybrid and electric vehicle sales. Hybrid sales, in particular, surged 38% to 48,101 units, while electric vehicle sales grew by 12%. Notably, Ford’s truck deliveries rose 6% year-over-year. Now Ford’s earnings performance has been uneven. In Q2 2024, adjusted profits came in at $0.47 per share, missing estimates and marking a 35% decline from Q2 2023. This lagged behind GM, which exceeded expectations. While Ford saw revenue growth of about 6% in the last quarter, earnings were dragged down by surging warranty repair costs linked to quality issues with vehicles produced in 2021 and earlier. These warranty costs have been a recurring pain point for Ford, with unexpected spikes—such as an $800 million increase in Q2—catching investors off guard. While concrete improvements in quality and warranty expenses are likely to take some time, Ford could benefit from a higher mix of truck sales as well as strong growth at its premium Lincoln brand. Ford stock’s performance over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 137% in 2021, -42% in 2022, and 16% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While there are concerns regarding the broader automotive market, Ford has a couple of positives that could drive future performance. One key shift is the company’s more balanced approach to electric vehicles. Previously, the slow pace of Ford’s EV transition weighed on the stock, but this is now easing. Ford’s revised strategy—focusing on a diversified portfolio of gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles—positions it well to meet evolving consumer preferences without over-committing to costly EV development. This strategy could help to improve profitability, as slower EV growth across the industry allows Ford to optimize its traditional segments while gradually refining its electric offerings. Separately, recent changes to U.S. monetary policy could also provide a tailwind. Last month, the Federal Reserve implemented its first rate cut in nearly four years, reducing the benchmark federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%. With room for further rate reductions, lower borrowing costs may stimulate demand for big-ticket purchases such as vehicles, benefiting automotive players such as Ford.

Title: Down 5%, What's Happening With Nvidia Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/17/why-did-nvidia-stock-fall-5/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T09:00:52Z

POLAND - 2024/09/30: In this photo illustration, a Nvidia logo is displayed on a smartphone with ... [+] binary code in the background. (Photo Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock fell by close to 4.5% on Tuesday. Peer AMD stock also saw a sharp decline, falling by about 5%. The selloff follows an earnings report by chip manufacturing equipment supplier ASML which indicated weaker-than-expected sales guidance for 2025, raising concerns among investors about global chip demand. ASML produces highly sophisticated photolithography machines, particularly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography equipment, which is essential for manufacturing cutting-edge semiconductor chips including the GPUs that Nvidia sells. ASML said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in at between Euro 30 billion to 35 billion, which is toward the bottom end of its previous forecast, with gross margin forecasts also coming in below estimates. Now, although the decline in guidance was attributed to slower chip demand recovery outside of the AI sector, Nvidia, being the world’s biggest semiconductor company by market cap, was impacted considerably. Additionally, there have been reports that the Biden administration may restrict sales of advanced AI processors to some Persian Gulf countries, citing national security concerns. This stems from worries that these countries could act as a conduit for China to acquire U.S. semiconductor technology that is currently banned from direct export to China. While Nvidia has been the poster child of the AI revolution, Here’s A Better AI Pick Than Nvidia stock The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? To be fair, Nvidia’s sharp stock decline on Tuesday may have been an overreaction. Much of the capital expenditure cuts that are likely impacting ASML potentially come from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung foundries, rather than from TSMC, Nvidia’s primary manufacturing partner. However, Nvidia stock still appears pricey. At its current market price of $132 per share, the stock trades at about 46x consensus FY’25 earnings and 33x FY’26 earnings. There are also risks ahead. See our scenario analysis on Could Nvidia Stock Crash To $40? The big surge in GPU demand that we are currently seeing could potentially ease, as the initial training phase of AI large language models slows down. After the training of models, the phase of utilizing these models could shift toward lower-power requirements, or potentially even on-device capabilities, reducing demand growth for GPUs. Competition is also mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Separately, the economics of the AI business remain weak, with heavy investments in GPU chips yielding minimal revenue. There are concerns that companies are investing in AI due to the fear of missing out, rather than focusing on returns. This could eventually lead to reduced capital spending and impact Nvidia, We value NVDA stock at $88 per share, about 33% below the current market price.

Title: JPMorgan Chase is winning the AI banking race — and its lead is getting bigger

Time Published: 2024-10-17T09:00:00Z

JPMorgan Chase (JPM+0.42%) held onto its spot as the artificial intelligence adoption leader in the banking sector. The largest U.S. bank has the highest volume of AI talent, which has grown 16% in the past 12 months, and has more AI researchers than its seven biggest competitors combined, according to the latest Evident AI Index, released Thursday. “JPMorganChase is unquestionably still the bank to beat when it comes to AI maturity,” said Evident co-founder and co-CEO Annabel Ayles. “The pace of its AI adoption is remarkable for an organization of its size and scale.” JPMorgan had been investing in AI for years before the chatbot craze took hold with the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. The financial institution hired its head of AI research, Manuela Veloso, in 2018 and has since grown its use cases to more than 400. And JPMorgan is already beginning to see the dollar value of its commitment. Company President Daniel Pinto said last month that the bank is expecting to see nearly $2 billion in returns from its investment into the technology this year, particularly related to fraud prevention. “Going forward, we think that artificial intelligence, large language models will have — and we are doing a lot of work on this over the medium- to long-term — a big impact in improving processes and efficiencies in the operational services that we have,” Pinto said. Since Evident began its rankings in early 2023, the top four banks have not only remained in their positions but have continued to plow forward. “The leaders are just pulling ahead and leading more,” Alexandra Mousavizadeh, Evident co-founder and co-CEO, said in an interview. Evident evaluates 50 major banks in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific based on public data relating to AI adoption, scoring the institutions based on talent, innovation, transparency, and leadership. While all 50 banks in the index have ramped up their adoption efforts since last year, the top 10 are improving twice as fast as the rest of the field, Evident found. Mousavizadeh said banks that are committing to AI are going all in: hiring, poaching talent, figuring out internal systems, testing, and partnering with major players such as Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) and Microsoft (MSFT+0.33%). “We can see these dynamics are creating bifurcation in the banking system,” Mousavizadeh said. “If you are slightly standing still, at what point does it become almost impossible to catch up? I would say we’re 18 months away from that.” A number of banks are doing the opposite of standing still. The biggest riser in this year’s index is Morgan Stanley (MS+1.36%), which jumped seven points and landed itself a spot in the top 10. The investment bank first partnered with OpenAI in March 2023, when it became the AI startup’s only wealth management partner. The firm rolled out the AI @ Morgan Stanley Assistant, a generative AI chatbot that helped financial advisors access the bank’s vast array of technical know-how, in September 2023. And this past June, the bank rolled out Debrief, a generative AI assistant that will support its financial advisors, built on OpenAI’s GPT-4. “The rise of HSBC (HSBC+0.79%) and Morgan Stanley show that it’s still possible for banks that have been slower out of the gates on AI to catch up and even overtake the field,” Ayles said. “The race for AI adoption is far from run, but there’s a growing gap between the leaders and the rest of the field. The lower ranking institutions need to pick up the pace if they wish to go the distance.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Most Promising Future Stock According to Analysts

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market. A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. READ ALSO: 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds and David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy. While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. “It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.” “But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around. “Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. Microsoft Headquarters Our Methodology To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 279 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 21.71%% Microsoft Edge is one of the most promising future stocks, according to analysts, as it is the biggest software provider. Additionally, the company is a leading player with a 25% market share in cloud computing while flexing its muscle in the multi-billion gaming industry with Activation’s Blizzard and Xbox. With the aid of new generative artificial intelligence (AI) assistants, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well-positioned to increase its market share in those software categories. During the June quarter, the number of users of Microsoft 365 Copilot grew by more than 60%. Regarding revenue from cloud infrastructure and platform services, Microsoft Azure lags behind Amazon Web Services; however, over the past year, Azure has gained a percentage point of market share thanks to its strengths in machine learning and artificial intelligence and according to CEO Satyr Nacelle, Azure AI’s customer base increased by almost 60% during that time. The vast majority of Microsoft’s planned capital expenditure increases will go toward expanding its AI infrastructure and cloud business. In its fiscal year 2024, it spent $55.7 billion, of which $19 billion was spent in the fourth quarter. Because of its strengths in cloud computing and enterprise software, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the businesses most positioned to profit from generative AI in the future. In fact, Wall Street predicts that over the next three years, the company’s earnings will increase by 13% per year. Even though Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31, It is one of the most promising stocks given its record in returning shareholder value. The company already pays a 0.80% dividend yield. Additionally, the stock is rated as a strong buy based on 30 Wall Street analysts with an average price target of $504.73, implying a 21.71% change from the last price of $414.71. In the second quarter, 279 hedge funds held positions in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and their stakes amounted to $89.068 billion. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $135 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock contributed to performance because of continued strong operating results and investor enthusiasm regarding Microsoft’s leadership across the secular megatrends of AI and cloud computing. Recent business momentum continued to show evidence of the strength and attractiveness of Microsoft’s product portfolio among its customer set: (1) Azure OpenAI – its suite of AI services – is now used by 65% of the Fortune 100 and contributed 7% of Azure revenue (an annualized run rate of $5.2 billion); (2) GitHub Copilot – its AI code writing service – is bending the productivity curve for developers (reports of 40%- plus improvements in developer efficiency) and now has 1.8 million paid subscribers, with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter; and (3) Copilot Studio – its AI application service that makes it easier for anyone to build an application, automate a workflow, or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. In the March quarter, Microsoft again reported better-than-expected financial results, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud growing 23% year-over-year, with the fastest commercial bookings in six quarters, and Azure accelerating to 31% constant currency growth, up from 28% in the previous quarter. June quarter guidance came in-line with consensus, but the company provided higher guidance for the most important segment, Intelligent Cloud, on the back of continued strong trends across Azure and Azure OpenAI. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes.” Overall MSFT ranks 7th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 20.45% Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a market leader in cloud computing and e-commerce retail, affirming its long-term growth prospects. The company generates a significant chunk of its revenues from e-commerce, with a market share of 37.6%. Cloud computing is increasingly becoming an essential piece of the puzzle amid artificial intelligence, as the company has a market share of 31% in the multibillion-dollar industry. The segment posted an 18.8% revenue increase in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters. Likewise, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is diversifying its operations into the fiercely competitive streaming service ad-supported market. As the US tech giant intensifies its push into ad-funded streaming services, it plans to introduce more ads across its popular TV series and films on Prime Video in the upcoming year. By the end of the year, Amazon is expected to have $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which will be three times its 2018 total. It is also expected to have nearly $400 billion in cash by 2027, far exceeding its competitors in the Big Tech sector. This is an incredible transformation for a business known for operating on thin margins, reinvesting most of its profits, and having comparatively little cash compared to its peers. Record profits from cloud computing, advertising, and increased efficiency, including cost reduction, are the main drivers of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ‘s cash increase. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that the company’s free cash flow will almost double from $36.8 billion last year to $70.8 billion in 2025. After other tech companies like Alphabet and Meta began giving back more of their cash to shareholders earlier this year, there was a surge in hopes for an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dividend or at least more share buybacks in recent quarters. Likewise, analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a Buy with an average price target of $222.95, implying 20.45% upside potential from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.” Overall AMZN ranks 8th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. Pixabay/ Public Domain Our Methodology To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 20.45% Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a market leader in cloud computing and e-commerce retail, affirming its long-term growth prospects. The company generates a significant chunk of its revenues from e-commerce, with a market share of 37.6%. Cloud computing is increasingly becoming an essential piece of the puzzle amid artificial intelligence, as the company has a market share of 31% in the multibillion-dollar industry. The segment posted an 18.8% revenue increase in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters. Likewise, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is diversifying its operations into the fiercely competitive streaming service ad-supported market. As the US tech giant intensifies its push into ad-funded streaming services, it plans to introduce more ads across its popular TV series and films on Prime Video in the upcoming year. By the end of the year, Amazon is expected to have $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which will be three times its 2018 total. It is also expected to have nearly $400 billion in cash by 2027, far exceeding its competitors in the Big Tech sector. This is an incredible transformation for a business known for operating on thin margins, reinvesting most of its profits, and having comparatively little cash compared to its peers. Record profits from cloud computing, advertising, and increased efficiency, including cost reduction, are the main drivers of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ‘s cash increase. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that the company’s free cash flow will almost double from $36.8 billion last year to $70.8 billion in 2025. After other tech companies like Alphabet and Meta began giving back more of their cash to shareholders earlier this year, there was a surge in hopes for an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dividend or at least more share buybacks in recent quarters. Likewise, analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a Buy with an average price target of $222.95, implying 20.45% upside potential from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.” Overall AMZN ranks 8th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Top 6 Growth Stocks For The Next 10 Years

Time Published: 2024-10-16T22:50:51Z

getty Now that high inflation has subsided and interest rates are falling, you may be looking to reposition your portfolio for growth. Let's explore three sectors and six growth stocks that could deliver on your long-term wealth creation goals. For patient investors, long-term growth stocks have upside. First, long holding periods minimize trading fees. Lower taxes can also result, especially with growth stocks that aren't paying dividends. Additionally, long holding periods are easier to manage and can encourage higher returns. Investors who aren't timing the market don't have to monitor and evaluate every headline. They also don't have to feel anxious about market downturns. They can simply do nothing and wait for the market to recover. Most importantly, long-term growth stocks can produce real wealth through compound returns. Compounding happens when stock price gains begin appreciating. The gains-on-gains phenomenon escalates growth potential over time, without further contributions. Economic trends shape the future of the growth economy. Understanding those trends can help you focus your research on sectors that are most likely to expand. Currently, the outlook is strong for technology, healthcare and energy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is predicting high job growth in these sectors based on three expected trends: Keeping the sector trends in mind, I identified six top growth stocks by screening U.S. public companies on these criteria: Combined, these qualities describe companies that have growth histories, strong outlooks, rising ROEs, manageable debt and the scale to absorb economic downturns. To finalize the best growth stock picks, I ordered the resulting list from the highest to lowest five-year EPS growth outlook. I then selected the top two from each of the targeted sectors.

Dynatrace operates a subscription-based technology infrastructure platform that monitors applications and microservices, protects against security vulnerabilities, logs analytics data and automates workflows to resolve security problems quickly. Dynatrace has customers around the world in financial services, retail, government, transportation and software. Statista reports that global spending on digital transformation—which is the business adoption of new technologies to enhance efficiency—reached $1.85 trillion in 2022. That represents 16% growth from the prior year. Enterprises undergoing digital transformation require better tools to optimize systems performance and prevent technology outages. Dynatrace is a top contender for that sizable market, which Insider Monkey has quantified at $50 billion. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, DT reported 20% constant-currency growth in annual recurring revenue versus the prior-year quarter. The company also increased its non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points to 29% and grew free cash flow by nearly 84%. Nvidia provides high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) for use in AI, autonomous driving, 5G, robotics and gaming applications. Nvidia is fabless, meaning the company outsources manufacturing to focus on design and innovation. Nvidia has been an incredible growth story over the last two years, rising from a split-adjusted $16 per share to nearly $140. Today, the company holds an estimated 70% to 95% market share for AI chips. That is an enviable position because Gartner projects AI chip spending will increase from $53 billion in 2023 to nearly $92 billion in 2025. Second-quarter 2025 highlights from Nvidia, reported in August, include 154% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in its data center division and 168% growth in diluted EPS. The data center division encompasses sales of NVDA's AI-related solutions.

First Solar provides photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions in the U.S. and worldwide. The company's thin PV modules have a lower carbon footprint than conventional crystalline silicon PV panels. The International Energy Agency expects solar power to deliver 80% of the growth in global renewable energy capacity between now and 2030. Rooftop solar systems plus the construction of major solar power plants will contribute. First Solar is the largest U.S. producer of solar panels, primarily serving industrial applications. First Solar's share price dipped in early October after two analysts lowered their price targets. The analysts from Jefferies and Bank of America held their buy ratings on FSLR but noted a few short-term headwinds. These included potential supply chain issues, labor shortages and regulatory concerns. For long-term solar investors, this pullback probably creates a buying opportunity. First Solar's second-quarter earnings highlights, reported in July, included 25% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and a doubling of diluted EPS versus the prior-year quarter. Boston Scientific makes medical devices that diagnose and treat various conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders, coronary artery disease and some forms of cancer. Customers include hospitals, clinics, medical offices and outpatient facilities around the world. At least four analysts have raised their price targets for BSX in recent weeks. One factor driving the excitement is Boston Scientific's planned early presentation of its transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) data. Analysts assume the expedited release signals confidence in the results of the company's study on its Acurate Transfemoral Aortic Valve System for TAVR. TAVR treats the narrowing of the aortic valve less invasively than open-heart surgery. Grand View Research has predicted the global TAVR market will grow at a CAGR of 7.2% between 2024 and 2030. Boston Scientific also recently closed on the acquisition of Silk Road Medical. The transaction is expected to be accretive to BSX's adjusted EPS in 2026 and beyond. In its second quarter 2024, Boston Scientific grew revenues by 14.5% and EPS by 22% from the prior-year period. Medpace is a clinical research organization that runs clinical trials for customers in the biotech, pharma and medical device industries. Customers are primarily small to mid-sized biopharma companies that do not have the resources required to run clinical trials in-house. The per-share price of Medpace has pulled back more than 20% since its earnings release in July. Analysts have also lowered their price targets. The good news is that these developments are related to temporary circumstances. Analysts are primarily concerned with slow biotech funding and deal flow, plus a decline in MEDP's bookings this year. UBS analyst Dan Leonard, as quoted by Business Insider, believes Medpace will grow faster than peers in the long term, even if the short-term pace is dampened by poor market conditions. In the second quarter 2024, Medpace grew revenue by 14.6%, backlog by 13.7% and diluted EPS by 42% versus the prior-year quarter. Schlumberger provides technology services for the oil and gas industry. From flow-rate measurement services to exploration data processing, the company's software and hardware solutions are designed to increase efficiency and streamline operations for oil and gas companies. As with Medpace, analysts covering Schlumberger have lowered price targets but remain bullish on the stock long term. A question mark in the immediate term is the outlook for oil prices. Falling oil prices could lessen production, which would be a headwind for Schlumberger. Despite analysts' reductions, the average price target on SLB still represents 42% upside. Schlumberger recently grew quarterly revenues by 13%, adjusted Ebitda by 17% and adjusted diluted EPS by 18% versus the prior-year period. You can maximize your portfolio's appreciation potential with growth stocks that operate within expanding economic sectors. Once you have those companies in your portfolio, stay patient and focused on the long term. Let compounding work its magic and it can deliver measurable increases in your net worth over time.

Title: Ford paying dealers up to $22,500 for F-150 Lightnings ordered from its new EV centers
URL: http://electrek.co/2024/10/16/ford-dealers-get-up-to-22500-f-150-lightning-orders-through-new-program/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T21:42:19Z
Full Content:
Ford dealers just got a significant incentive to test its new pilot program. For every F-150 Lighting ordered from one of Ford’s new Retail Replenishment Centers, dealers can earn up to $1,500. Over the next month, Ford dealers can score up to $22,500 through the new program. During Capital Markets Day last May, Ford CEO Jim Farley outlined plans to make buying an electric vehicle as easy as possible. The changes included transparent pricing, a better customer experience, and remote delivery options. To get vehicles into customers’ hands quicker, Ford said it would introduce new Retail Replenishment Centers (RRC) that can deliver EVs to dealers in an average of seven days. According to a new memo (via CarsDirect), Ford will pay dealers up to $1,500 for each F-150 Lightning model ordered from an RRC. The pilot program runs from October 15 through November 15, 2024. Ford said it encourages dealers to test and experience the new EV distribution centers through the program. With RRCs spread across the US, Ford dealers can stock fewer vehicles while giving buyers access to more options. Ford is paying dealers $1,000 for each F-150 Lightning (XLT, Flash, Lariat, and Platinum trims) ordered through an RRC. If a dealer orders more than nine (a maximum of 15), the incentive increases to $1,500. Throughout the month, dealers can earn up to $22,500. Ford’s dealer note said the program is designed to “further test the logistics and efficiencies of RRCs” while boosting engagement. The incentive applies to all trims except the base F-150 Lightning Pro, which is no longer available for retail sale. As CarsDirect points out, the program could be good and bad for buyers. Some dealers will want to move F-150 Lightning inventory at lower prices, while others can sell models that don’t have many on the lot. Instead of giving the dealer incentives, free chargers, and door to door service how about you just lower the price to the consumer. It really isn't that hard... However, this could mean fewer choices when visiting a dealership. The pilot program likely comes as Ford looks to move older models ahead of the new 2025 F-150 Lightning. Ford has introduced significant incentives for the electric truck in recent months. The 2024 F-150 Lightning is available with 0% APR for 60 months. In addition, through its new “Ford Power Promise,” all EV buyers get a free Level 2 home charger, and Ford is covering the cost of installation. The offer includes a $2,000 cash incentive that can be combined with 0% financing. Are you ready to take advantage of the savings? 2024 models may not last long with 2025MY arrivals around the corner. You can find the best deals on Ford’s F-150 Lightning near you using our link.

"I've made so many mistakes in my investment career — one of them was I sold all my Nvidia probably somewhere between $800 and $950," Druckenmiller said in an interview on Bloomberg. "I own none and I owned none the last 400 points." Druckenmiller's comments do not reflect Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect in June. The stock closed Wednesday at $135.72. On a split-adjusted basis, his sales would have taken place at between $80 and $95. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, selling its graphics processing units, or GPUs, to top cloud companies and the biggest developers of large language models. The stock soared 239% last year and is up another 174% in 2024, closing at a fresh record on Monday. Earlier this year, Druckenmiller revealed on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that he cut his Duquesne Family Office's position in Nvidia in late March, saying "we've had a hell of a run." Taking the split into account, Duquesne owned about 6.18 million shares at the start of the year, 1.76 million at the end of the first quarter and 214,000 when the second quarter closed. In the third quarter of last year, Nvidia was his top holding. At the time, he owned 8.75 million shares worth around $400 million. If he held onto that entire stake, it would currently be worth about $1.19 billion. Duquesne has not released its third-quarter holdings yet. "It tripled in a year, and I thought the valuation was rich," Druckenmiller told Bloomberg. "Nvidia is a wonderful company and were the price to come down, we'd get involved again. But right now, I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale." Nvidia is expected to release quarterly results in November, but most of its top customers, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, will report financials later this month. Druckenmiller told CNBC in May that Nvidia was "a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term." He added that he was introduced to Nvidia in 2022, when "I didn't even know how to spell it."

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The Fashion Group International held its 40th annual gala at The Plaza hotel. Senior Editor With all of the slick runway shows, big-name designers and highly polished boutiques, fashion can appear to be all glamour, but working in the industry takes fortitude — and time. That was a recurring message from several of the award winners at the Fashion Group International‘s “Night of Stars” at The Plaza hotel Tuesday night. It was also suitable considering that the event was marking a 40-year anniversary — no small feat given New York City’s busy fall social calendar. Even when welcoming guests, Zac Posen and Coco Rocha, (who were the evening’s honorary chairs with Richard Dickson), touched upon the tests of time in their friendship and careers. Posen joked that he had become a FGI “Rising Star” award winner in 1800. And Rocha showed off his current agility — an evening gown made of Gap icon denim jackets. Posen, Gap Inc.’s newly installed executive vice president and creative director, quickly turned the spotlight onto the honorees, saying, “Tonight we are here to celebrate you. You have elevated our craft to new heights. You are the true stars tonight, and we applaud your remarkable contributions.” Related Articles Beauty Features Beauty's Leading Female Scientists Talk Innovation, Experimentation and Representation From The Newsroom Jane Lauder Shares a Journey of Innovation and Legacy FGI’s leader Maryanne Grisz acknowledged how integral the late Margaret Hayes and Diane Clehane were to creating the annual gala. Recalling how FGI was founded “by women and for women in 1930,” Grisz hinted at the next generation, wearing a gown designed by Cyril Verdavainne, a 2024 “Rising Star” winner. The organization now spans 26 regions as “a grassroots organization that can make change happen.” In addition to plans to make “Night of Stars” a global event, the group has launched a Thought Leaders Platinum Membership. You May Also Like Honoring Fern Mallis with the Founders award, MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle spoke of how fashion is “a really, really hard business behind-the scenes. Everyone in this room knows it. It is an industry where the margins are so small. One year you are the hottest, most fabulous, celebrated person and the next season you’re forgotten,” she said. Beyond being able to spot a trend and new talent, Ruhle praised Mallis for her realness and understanding of human nature, talent, hard work, drive and “what real mentorship is.” Hundreds of guests seemed to agree, giving Mallis, the architect behind New York Fashion Week and creator of “Fashion Icons” talks, the only standing ovation of the night. “I love being part of this extraordinary industry, which can be tough, challenging and sometimes even appreciative, but ultimately warm, generous, unpredictable and always creative,” Mallis said. “Remember my advice to succeed is, ‘Be nice and vote.’” Estée Lauder’s Catherine Bomboy Dougherty was saluted for championing education and literacy with poet Amanda Gorman and for helping to raise more than $50 million with MAC Viva Glam and Rihanna to benefit HIV and AIDS patients. The “Beauty” award winner, said, “Beauty is about more than appearances. It’s about empowerment, confidence, self-expression. I am so fortunate to work alongside people, who understand the power of beauty and helping others to feel seen and valued.” During the Night of Stars program, former “Night of Stars” winners like Elie Tahari and Dennis Basso took to the stage separately to toast FGI’s milestone and the organization. Presenting the “Vanguard” award to her business partner LaQuan Smith, Jacqueline Cooper recalled how they met “in a very organic, beautiful way — the club of New York City.” She said, “It’s crazy how he has been able to accomplish everything that he set out to do, but also be very true to himself, organic and still have this love of New York City and vibrancy that we don’t really see too often nowadays.” Smith said, “From a young boy growing up in Queens, N.Y., designing dresses in my grandmother’s basement, I have certainly come a long way.” Just as his grandparents “never wavered in their support” of him, Smith acknowledged Cooper’s support and shared the award with her. “Jackie is everything — my business partner, manager, wife, best friend. I’ve never had anyone who has fought so hard for me. We really do fight like cats and dogs — it’s really bad sometimes. But she is always there for me and saying, ‘LaQuan, today is a new day’ — no matter how hard it gets.” The 2024 “Humanitarian” award winner, Harry Kargman, Kargo’s founder and chief executive officer, was unable to attend the gala, due to the recent loss of his father-in-law Arie Kopelman, former president and chief operating officer of Chanel Inc. Heidi and Marc D’Amelio, and one of their influencer daughters Dixie, accepted the Media award on behalf of their social media-centric family, which has a reach of 400 million. (Their daughter Charli is busy preparing for her Broadway debut in “& Juliet.”) The New York City-born Marc D’Amelio clued in many to the fact that he had started his own clothing brand 20 years ago and that his great grandfather had been a dress designer in New York. “My wife came here from Louisiana and fashion brought us together. I remember being in Paris watching Dixie do a fashion shoot for Valentino, and Charli’s doing things for Prada,” he said. “I think about how fashion has impacted our lives and [the lives of] so many families in this audience. It’s really incredible what FGI is doing with all of the opportunities that’s it going to give to so many people to experience what my family has experienced.” Picking up the “Fashion Visionary” award, Reed Krakoff spoke of the significance of being celebrated by one’s peers, many of whom he’s grown up with in the industry in the past 30 years. “People like Fern, who was one of my early supporters. I think she was my only supporter at one point,” Krakoff quipped. “I actually was rejected by the CFDA once. Fern was instrumental in getting me in.” Highlighting his career stops at Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Coach, Tiffany & Co., and now John Hardy, Krakoff mentioned how along the way there were moments where someone saw something in him that he didn’t see. He singled out Hilfiger for tapping him as creative director, when that role was just emerging. He also mentioned how he joined Coach, despite having never designed a handbag, a fact that others were unaware of — but he learned. “This industry is so much more than a job. I’ve been so fortunate to have so many incredible relationships, experiences, travel, and ups and downs. As all of the creative people who came up here have mentioned, fashion is a tough business. But the relationships and the people are really what make it what it is,” he said. Accepting the “Fashion Heritage” award from the actress Kate Hudson, Max Mara’s Maria Giulia Prezioso Maramotti recalled how as a four-year-old she visited her grandfather at work drawing. “I still feel the same passion and excitement today that I felt when I was four years old. This is why, for us, Max Mara, is much more than a fashion house. It is our family legacy, a labor of love and it represents our values of the vision of my grandfather, when he founded the company in 1951.” Emphasizing how that continues, Maramotti said, “My family and I are committed to continuing our mission of creating beautiful, meaningful fashion that resonates across time, because after all, that is what heritage is about — the ability to transfer beauty and values across generations.” As The Plaza’s ballroom emptied out and some guests spoke of nightcaps, the D’Amelios gamely posed for selfies with attendees — they have “never refused a photo — ever,” according to Marc D’Amelio. That fan base inevitably could bode well for his kin’s next venture. With D’Amelio Footwear up-and-running, the plan is to do some licensing deals for accessories and other categories. One thing that most designers can’t do is play the piano with their toes, as Dixie D’Amelio can and occasionally still does. “Just to make sure that I still can — I’ve got a few songs,” she said, before being reeled into another selfie.

Getty Images/iStockphoto Certain companies have risen to prominence in the ever-evolving stock market landscape, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Seven technology giants have emerged, collectively known as the "Magnificent Seven." These companies have reshaped industries and become powerhouses in the global economy, wielding significant influence over market trends and investor sentiment. The term "Magnificent Seven" in the context of the stock market refers to a group of large-cap technology companies that have dominated the U.S. stock market in recent years. These companies are at the forefront of innovation in various tech sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Magnificent Seven stocks have profoundly impacted significant market indices, particularly the S&P 500. Due to their massive market capitalizations and firm performance, these stocks have disproportionately influenced the index's overall performance. Their combined weight in the S&P 500 has at times exceeded 35%, meaning the performance of just these seven stocks can significantly sway the entire index. This concentration of market power in a small group of tech companies has excited and concerned investors and market analysts. While their growth has driven substantial gains in the broader market, it has also raised questions about market concentration and the potential risks of overreliance on a handful of stocks. The term Magnificent Seven, as it applies to these specific stocks, gained widespread usage in the financial media and among investors in early 2023. It was popularized as these companies consistently outperformed the broader market and became increasingly dominant in their respective sectors. The name is a nod to the classic 1960 Western film The Magnificent Seven, which featured seven gunfighters hired to protect a village. In the stock market context, these seven companies are seen as protectors and drivers of market growth, especially during times of economic uncertainty. The term caught on quickly, becoming a shorthand way to refer to this group of influential tech stocks that have shaped market dynamics in recent years. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. The Magnificent Seven stocks comprise some of the most recognizable names in the technology sector. These companies have become household names, not just for investors but for consumers worldwide. Let's take a closer look at each of these tech giants: Apple is a global technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Apple has become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion. The company is renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software and services. Apple's product line includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch and various services such as Apple Music, Apple TV+ and iCloud. The company's ecosystem of products and services has created a loyal customer base, contributing to its strong financial performance and market position. Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Initially known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity software suite, Microsoft has diversified into cloud computing, gaming and artificial intelligence. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform has become a significant player in the cloud computing market, competing directly with Amazon Web Services. Other notable products include the Xbox gaming console, the Surface line of devices, and the LinkedIn professional networking platform. Amazon.com, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, started as an online bookstore but has since grown into the world's largest e-commerce company. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon has expanded its operations to include cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's highly profitable cloud computing platform. The company also offers Prime Video streaming service and the Alexa virtual assistant and has made significant inroads into the grocery sector by acquiring Whole Foods Market. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998. While Google remains its largest subsidiary and is best known for its search engine, Alphabet oversees various other businesses and initiatives. Google's services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud and the Android mobile operating system. Alphabet is also involved in more speculative technological endeavors through its "Other Bets" segment, which includes companies like Waymo (self-driving cars) and Verily (life sciences research). Tesla, founded in 2003 and led by CEO Elon Musk since 2008, is an American multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage and solar panel manufacturing. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. The company's product line includes electric cars such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y and energy storage solutions like the powerwall and solar roof tiles. Tesla's innovations have forced traditional automakers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles. Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta is a social technology company that owns and operates some of the world's most popular social media and messaging platforms.

Nvidia, founded in 1993 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, is a technology company best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming and professional markets. In recent years, Nvidia has become a significant player in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company's GPUs are widely used in data centers for AI training and inference, as well as in autonomous vehicles and robotics. Nvidia's technology is also crucial in developing the metaverse and other advanced computing applications. The Magnificent Seven have earned their moniker due to their dominant positions in and outsized global economic impact. These companies are at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce and digital advertising. Their products and services have become integral to both businesses and consumers worldwide. The Magnificent Seven's influence is pervasive, from the smartphones in our pockets to the cloud infrastructure powering countless applications. Moreover, their financial might and market capitalizations have made them significant players in the stock market, often serving as bellwethers for the broader technology sector and the economy. The performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years has been nothing short of extraordinary. These companies have consistently outperformed the broader market, driving a significant portion of the gains in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. In 2020, these tech giants demonstrated remarkable resilience amid the global pandemic. As the world shifted to remote work and digital services, companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple saw their revenues and stock prices soar. The trend continued into 2021 and 2022, with these stocks often defying broader market volatility. However, it's important to note that their performance could have been more uniformly positive. Market sentiment, regulatory concerns and company-specific issues have led to periods of volatility. For instance, Meta (then Facebook) faced privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny challenges, while Tesla has seen significant price swings tied to production issues and Elon Musk's public statements. Many analysts and economists remain optimistic about the Magnificent Seven's long-term growth prospects. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing technological trends, such as the continued shift to cloud computing, the growth of e-commerce, advancements in artificial intelligence, and the development of new technologies like autonomous vehicles and the metaverse. Apple and Microsoft, with their robust ecosystem of products and services, are expected to continue benefiting from the increasing digitization of business and personal life. Amazon's e-commerce dominance and the growth of its cloud computing arm, AWS, position it well for future growth. Alphabet (Google) and Meta will likely continue benefiting from the shift to digital advertising. As a leader in electric vehicles, Tesla is poised to capitalize on the global transition to sustainable transportation. With its crucial role in AI and high-performance computing, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for these technologies across various industries. However, it's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. These companies face challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny, intensifying competition, and the need to innovate to maintain their market positions continually. While the Magnificent Seven stocks have shown impressive performance, they are not without risks. One of the primary concerns is their high valuations. Many of these stocks trade at premium multiples compared to the broader market, which could make them vulnerable to significant corrections if they fail to meet high growth expectations. Regulatory risk is another primary concern. As these companies have grown in size and influence, they have attracted increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Antitrust investigations, data privacy concerns, and new regulations could impact their business models and growth prospects. Market concentration is another risk factor. The outsized influence of these seven stocks on major indices means that any significant downturn in their performance could have a disproportionate impact on the broader market. This concentration also raises concerns about market diversity and the potential for increased volatility. Finally, as leaders in their respective fields, these companies face constant pressure to innovate and stay ahead of competitors. Please do so to avoid loss of market share and investor confidence. Analyst and investor sentiment towards the Magnificent Seven stocks has generally been positive, reflecting their strong financial performance and dominant market positions. Many analysts maintain "buy" or "outperform" ratings on these stocks, citing their strong cash flows, robust balance sheets, and opportunities for continued growth. Investors have been attracted to these stocks for their growth potential and, in some cases, their ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Given their financial strength and market dominance, the Magnificent Seven have often been seen as a haven during market uncertainty. However, sentiment can shift quickly based on earnings reports, macroeconomic conditions, or company-specific news. For instance, concerns about inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 led to a sell-off in tech stocks, including some of the Magnificent Seven. The influence of the Magnificent Seven on the overall stock market cannot be overstated. Due to their massive market capitalizations, these seven stocks can significantly sway major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Their performance often sets the tone for the broader technology sector and can influence overall market sentiment. Robust earnings reports from these companies can lift the entire market, while disappointing results can lead to broader selloffs. The Magnificent Seven's dominance has also raised questions about market concentration and its potential implications for index fund investors. As these stocks have grown to represent a more significant portion of market-cap-weighted indices, passive investors may have greater exposure to these companies than they realize. The Magnificent Seven stocks represent a technology giant group that has reshaped industries and dominated stock market performance in recent years. Their innovative products and services, financial strength, and market influence have made them key players in the global economy. While these stocks offer significant growth potential, they also come with risks, including high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, and the constant pressure to innovate. Investors should carefully consider these factors and their risk tolerance when evaluating these stocks as part of their investment strategy. The Magnificent Seven stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Tesla, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia. These large-cap technology companies have significantly influenced the U.S. stock market recently. You can invest in the Magnificent Seven by purchasing individual stocks or through index funds and ETFs with significant exposure to these companies, such as those tracking the S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100. These companies are influential due to their massive market capitalizations, dominant positions in their respective industries and their role in driving technological innovation across various sectors of the economy. Risks include high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, intense competition and market concentration. Additionally, their immense influence on market indices means any significant downturn in their performance could impact the broader market.

However, sentiment can shift quickly based on earnings reports, macroeconomic conditions, or company-specific news. For instance, concerns about inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 led to a sell-off in tech stocks, including some of the Magnificent Seven. The influence of the Magnificent Seven on the overall stock market cannot be overstated. Due to their massive market capitalizations, these seven stocks can significantly sway major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Their performance often sets the tone for the broader technology sector and can influence overall market sentiment. Robust earnings reports from these companies can lift the entire market, while disappointing results can lead to broader selloffs. The Magnificent Seven's dominance has also raised questions about market concentration and its potential implications for index fund investors. As these stocks have grown to represent a more significant portion of market-cap-weighted indices, passive investors may have greater exposure to these companies than they realize. The Magnificent Seven stocks represent a technology giant group that has reshaped industries and dominated stock market performance in recent years. Their innovative products and services, financial strength, and market influence have made them key players in the global economy. While these stocks offer significant growth potential, they also come with risks, including high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, and the constant pressure to innovate. Investors should carefully consider these factors and their risk tolerance when evaluating these stocks as part of their investment strategy. The Magnificent Seven stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Tesla, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia. These large-cap technology companies have significantly influenced the U.S. stock market recently. You can invest in the Magnificent Seven by purchasing individual stocks or through index funds and ETFs with significant exposure to these companies, such as those tracking the S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100. These companies are influential due to their massive market capitalizations, dominant positions in their respective industries and their role in driving technological innovation across various sectors of the economy. Risks include high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, intense competition and market concentration. Additionally, their immense influence on market indices means any significant downturn in their performance could impact the broader market.

Getty Images/iStockphoto Certain companies have risen to prominence in the ever-evolving stock market landscape, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Seven technology giants have emerged, collectively known as the "Magnificent Seven." These companies have reshaped industries and become powerhouses in the global economy, wielding significant influence over market trends and investor sentiment. The term "Magnificent Seven" in the context of the stock market refers to a group of large-cap technology companies that have dominated the U.S. stock market in recent years. These companies are at the forefront of innovation in various tech sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Magnificent Seven stocks have profoundly impacted significant market indices, particularly the S&P 500. Due to their massive market capitalizations and firm performance, these stocks have disproportionately influenced the index's overall performance. Their combined weight in the S&P 500 has at times exceeded 35%, meaning the performance of just these seven stocks can significantly sway the entire index. This concentration of market power in a small group of tech companies has excited and concerned investors and market analysts. While their growth has driven substantial gains in the broader market, it has also raised questions about market concentration and the potential risks of overreliance on a handful of stocks. The term Magnificent Seven, as it applies to these specific stocks, gained widespread usage in the financial media and among investors in early 2023. It was popularized as these companies consistently outperformed the broader market and became increasingly dominant in their respective sectors. The name is a nod to the classic 1960 Western film The Magnificent Seven, which featured seven gunfighters hired to protect a village. In the stock market context, these seven companies are seen as protectors and drivers of market growth, especially during times of economic uncertainty. The term caught on quickly, becoming a shorthand way to refer to this group of influential tech stocks that have shaped market dynamics in recent years. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. The Magnificent Seven stocks comprise some of the most recognizable names in the technology sector. These companies have become household names, not just for investors but for consumers worldwide. Let's take a closer look at each of these tech giants: Apple is a global technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Apple has become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion. The company is renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software and services.

The company's ecosystem of products and services has created a loyal customer base, contributing to its strong financial performance and market position. Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Initially known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity software suite, Microsoft has diversified into cloud computing, gaming and artificial intelligence.

While Google remains its largest subsidiary and is best known for its search engine, Alphabet oversees various other businesses and initiatives. Google's services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud and the Android mobile operating system. Alphabet is also involved in more speculative technological endeavors through its "Other Bets" segment, which includes companies like Waymo (self-driving cars) and Verily (life sciences research). Tesla, founded in 2003 and led by CEO Elon Musk since 2008, is an American multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage and solar panel manufacturing. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. The company's product line includes electric cars such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y and energy storage solutions like the powerwall and solar roof tiles. Tesla's innovations have forced traditional automakers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles. Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta is a social technology company that owns and operates some of the world's most popular social media and messaging platforms.

The company's GPUs are widely used in data centers for AI training and inference, as well as in autonomous vehicles and robotics. Nvidia's technology is also crucial in developing the metaverse and other advanced computing applications. The Magnificent Seven have earned their moniker due to their dominant positions in and outsized global economic impact. These companies are at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce and digital advertising. Their products and services have become integral to both businesses and consumers worldwide. The Magnificent Seven's influence is pervasive, from the smartphones in our pockets to the cloud infrastructure powering countless applications. Moreover, their financial might and market capitalizations have made them significant players in the stock market, often serving as bellwethers for the broader technology sector and the economy. The performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years has been nothing short of extraordinary. These companies have consistently outperformed the broader market, driving a significant portion of the gains in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. In 2020, these tech giants demonstrated remarkable resilience amid the global pandemic. As the world shifted to remote work and digital services, companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple saw their revenues and stock prices soar. The trend continued into 2021 and 2022, with these stocks often defying broader market volatility. However, it's important to note that their performance could have been more uniformly positive. Market sentiment, regulatory concerns and company-specific issues have led to periods of volatility. For instance, Meta (then Facebook) faced privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny challenges, while Tesla has seen significant price swings tied to production issues and Elon Musk's public statements. Many analysts and economists remain optimistic about the Magnificent Seven's long-term growth prospects. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing technological trends, such as the continued shift to cloud computing, the growth of e-commerce, advancements in artificial intelligence, and the development of new technologies like autonomous vehicles and the metaverse. Apple and Microsoft, with their robust ecosystem of products and services, are expected to continue benefiting from the increasing digitization of business and personal life. Amazon's e-commerce dominance and the growth of its cloud computing arm, AWS, position it well for future growth. Alphabet (Google) and Meta will likely continue benefiting from the shift to digital advertising. As a leader in electric vehicles, Tesla is poised to capitalize on the global transition to sustainable transportation. With its crucial role in AI and high-performance computing, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for these technologies across various industries. However, it's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. These companies face challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny, intensifying competition, and the need to innovate to maintain their market positions continually. While the Magnificent Seven stocks have shown impressive performance, they are not without risks. One of the primary concerns is their high valuations. Many of these stocks trade at premium multiples compared to the broader market, which could make them vulnerable to significant corrections if they fail to meet high growth expectations. Regulatory risk is another primary concern. As these companies have grown in size and influence, they have attracted increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Antitrust investigations, data privacy concerns, and new regulations could impact their business models and growth prospects. Market concentration is another risk factor. The outsized influence of these seven stocks on major indices means that any significant downturn in their performance could have a disproportionate impact on the broader market. This concentration also raises concerns about market diversity and the potential for increased volatility. Finally, as leaders in their respective fields, these companies face constant pressure to innovate and stay ahead of competitors. Please do so to avoid loss of market share and investor confidence. Analyst and investor sentiment towards the Magnificent Seven stocks has generally been positive, reflecting their strong financial performance and dominant market positions. Many analysts maintain "buy" or "outperform" ratings on these stocks, citing their strong cash flows, robust balance sheets, and opportunities for continued growth. Investors have been attracted to these stocks for their growth potential and, in some cases, their ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Given their financial strength and market dominance, the Magnificent Seven have often been seen as a haven during market uncertainty.

Title: Walmart’s CTO places bigger bets on generative AI as customer shopping habits evolve

Over a few decades, consumers have moved from shopping exclusively in brick-and-mortar stores, to online, and more recently to spending billions annually through mobile apps. Now, consumers are changing their shopping habits again. Walmart calls the new reality “adaptive retail,” which is more about personalized shopping, an expectation that retailers will anticipate what consumers want before they decide themselves, and shoppers buying specific products based on what they see influencers pitching on social media. This evolution of consumer thinking has led Walmart to invest in newer technologies, including generative artificial intelligence. “Shopping is not just a blend of core retail and e-commerce,” says Hari Vasudev, executive vice president and chief technology officer of Walmart U.S. “It’s really a much more fluid experience.” As Walmart sees it, online shopping has been narrowly focused. Consumers would enter a few search terms to find the exact television or jeans they were looking for. Online retailers were tasked with selling goods at a desirable price and offering efficient and speedy delivery. But shoppers are getting more loquacious. They’re asking more detailed questions about products, and they want to use new tools, including 3D that can visualize furniture in their home, for example. According to Walmart, they also increasingly want to shop with the help of virtual reality to see what clothes they want to buy look like. Meanwhile, social channels like TikTok and live streaming services including Twitch provide inspiration for shopping. “The search bar is no longer the way to shop,” says Vasudev. That’s led Walmart to pivot by announcing this month that it’s starting to use predictive models and generative AI to offer a personalized version of walmart.com for every American shopper. The feature will fully roll out by the end of next year. “The way we’re thinking about applying AI and generative AI is to offer highly curated experiences and content,” says Vasudev. The goal is to create a personalized experience for each shopper based on what they’ve bought previously or searched for online, matched with what’s been a strong seller for Walmart or trending on social. Location and time of year would also factor in. A shopper who’s previously bought goods for their dog will be shown pet costumes for Halloween. Customers in Minnesota and Arkansas will be marketed new sweaters at different points in the season, based on when winter hits. Walmart’s generative AI efforts have thus far focused on five areas: the customer shopping experience, improving how in-store associates do their work, operational areas like supply chain and merchandising, content generation, and making software developers more productive. AI-focused tools Walmart has launched in the last few years to help employees save time have included “Ask Sam,” which lets associates ask questions like where to find a specific item in a store, and MyAssistant, a tool for corporate employees that can summarize large documents and write drafts. In most instances, Walmart is favoring “build” over “buy” when it comes to generative AI. The company centralized machine learning capabilities in a proprietary platform, called Element, so tech staff could experiment with AI models without having to worry if they would fit into a specific vendor or cloud provider. Walmart is using a blend of in-house large language models, proprietary offerings from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, and open-source models. This month, Walmart also unveiled a generative AI-powered customer support assistant that relies on retail-specific large language models. The generative AI, Walmart says, will enable the chatbot to anticipate customer questions and offer more proactive solutions for handling returns, exchanges, and other problems that may arise. And in some cases, the new AI agents are proving to be twice as fast as the humans, according to Vasudev. Throughout the development process, Walmart says finding the right conversational tone was critical. “When we have something like a chat experience, you want to make sure that the quality of the conversation feels empathetic and feels very genuine,” says Vasudev. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Adobe gets more creative on AI pricing. Adobe says the company’s new video-generating AI product will be priced differently than other AI tools, with CEO Shantanu Narayen acknowledging that the cost to produce video is “a little bit more expensive.” It's the latest indication that tech firms are tinkering with their approach to pricing while also racing to develop and launch new AI products. Bloomberg reports that until now, Adobe hasn't charged for the use of the software company’s AI features beyond standard subscription fees. And while users are allotted certain credits for using AI, Adobe isn’t enforcing those limits for most plans. Amazon, Databricks ink AI chips deal. Amazon.com and Databricks have agreed to a five-year deal that will let the startup use Amazon’s Trainium AI chips to power a service that would let companies customize an AI model, or even build their own. The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal will let Amazon continue to position itself as a neutral provider of AI technology, while Databricks makes money from cloud-based AI software and other services from companies building their technology tools. Databricks and Amazon already work together, as Amazon Web Services is one of Databricks’ cloud partners, and Databricks also rents Nvidia’s graphics processing units through AWS. TikTok, Boeing announce layoffs for very different reasons. ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, said the social media platform is laying off 500 employees, most of whom moderated content on the service. TikTok says that 80% of content that violates the company’s guidelines is already removed by automated technologies, but the latest cut is an even greater shift to using AI for content policing. Separately, Boeing is cutting 10% of its workforce, or 17,000 employees. The aerospace company also announced it would end production in 2027 of the 767 freighter, which has faced setbacks for years related to questions about the company’s quality control and safety precautions. Tesla’s robotics and AI event disappoints; CIO departs. Tesla’s Cybercab event, aimed at persuading investors that the electric vehicle maker is also a leader in AI and robotics, failed to impress Wall Street. Much of the criticism fell on CEO Elon Musk for failing to share any specifics about the timeline or operational rollout of the self-driving Cybercab. Meanwhile, Bloomberg and other outlets reported that humans were remotely controlling some capabilities of the Optimus robot prototypes that had initially made a splash online when they were unveiled last week. Ahead of the event, Bloomberg also reported that Nagesh Saldi, Tesla’s chief information officer, is leaving the company. Saldi had reported directly to Musk and had been involved in building out new data centers in Texas and New York. Increased efficiency is a top genAI aspiration. Executives surveyed by MIT Technology Review Insights, along with business technology provider Snowflake, found that 72% were prioritizing increased efficiency and productivity from their generative AI efforts, far exceeding their hope for increased revenue (30%) or reducing costs (24%). Increased market competitiveness ranked second at 55% in the survey, and product and services innovations and improved customer satisfaction were also seen as more valuable than boosting the top line or trimming expenses. The poll of around 275 business leaders also found that 53% say their data foundations were “somewhat ready” for gen AI, meaning their data has been properly gathered, aggregated, stored, and is accessible to support generative AI applications. Twenty-two percent were more confident, saying their data foundations are “very ready.” The remaining 25% felt either “somewhat” or “very” unready.

Title: TSMC is making chips for Apple in the U.S.

Time Published: 2024-10-16T17:50:06Z
Full Content:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) has reportedly started making its first chips for a major customer at its new fabrication plant in Arizona. The chipmaker is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix, Arizona, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported in September, citing unnamed sources. The chips, which are being made with the 5nm process, are being produced “in small, but significant, numbers,” Culpan said. Two people familiar with the matter told Business Insider that production of A16 chips has started but that the facility hasn’t reached full production levels, the publication reported Wednesday. Production volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said. “The Arizona project is proceeding as planned with good progress,” a spokesperson for TSMC told Culpan. Neither Apple (AAPL+1.23%) nor TSMC immediately responded to Quartz’s request for comment. TSMC Arizona’s A16 chips are being manufactured with the same process that it uses for A16 chips in Taiwan, Culpan reported. In September, Bloomberg reported that TSMC’s yield rate, or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process, at its Arizona fab is similar to yield rates at comparable facilities in Taiwan. It’s not clear which Apple devices will use the chips, Culpan said. The Taiwanese chipmaker makes an estimated 90% of the world’s advanced chips and counts chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) and Apple as its top partners. In April, the Biden administration announced TSMC would receive $6.6 billion in grants through the federal Chips and Science Act to support its first major U.S. chipmaking hub in Arizona. TSMC’s two chipmaking factories in Arizona are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028, while some of the anticipated Chips Act funding will support building a third facility. The company is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion when it announces earnings Thursday, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Jim Cramer has recently discussed the resilience of the "Magnificent Seven" and Netflix (NFLX, Financial) as the overall index continues to climb. Among these top performers are Amazon (AMZN, Financial), Alphabet(GOOGL, Financial), Apple (AAPL, Financial), Microsoft (MSFT, Financial), Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), Meta Platforms (META, Financial), and Tesla (TSLA, Financial). Cramer highlighted effective rebounds following recent dips. He specifically pointed to Nvidia and Apple as buy-and-hold opportunities due to their robust fundamentals despite share price volatility. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with TSLA. Cramer expressed optimism about Apple's prospects in China, downplaying the skepticism around its operations there. However, he was more cautious about Alphabet, citing ongoing antitrust cases, yet he remained confident in its potential for a rebound. He praised Amazon's web services and Meta's robust advertising platform as critical drivers of their recent successes. Addressing the rumors affecting Microsoft's AI assistant, Cramer urged for more substantial evidence before dismissing the company's prospects. He also advised against betting against Tesla, noting Elon Musk's proven track record in navigating company controversies. He also mentioned that Netflix has yet to capitalize on its new advertising segment fully. Cramer characterized the current market movement as a tech rally that not only boosts its own sector but also elevates other market segments, aided by recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This marks a departure from previous rallies, suggesting a more supportive environment for widespread market growth. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Alright, alright, stop panicking over the swing state polling for one second and listen up. The most important election since the last one is upon us, and the choice between voting for Vice President Kamala Harris and the worst American in recent memory is only one of the extremely consequential decisions you will have to make on this hell ballot. Right off the bat, you’ll have to face the Four Initiatives of the Apocalypse. They’ll cut billions in education funding, billions in funding for transit and clean energy programs, completely destroy a long-term health care benefit that we’ll all rely on sooner than we think, and ensure that Washington remains forever dependent on fossil fuels. Not good! Not good at all! After we reject all that bullshit, we need to pick members of Congress who will either help Harris deliver for the people or else serve as a bulwark against the last President of the United States. At the state level, we need to build a blue wall of executives to shield against attacks from a possible Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress, or, if our better angels prevail, to effectively implement the laws our lawmakers pass. Speaking of those lawmakers, we have the chance to give Democrats supermajorities in the State Legislature, which they could use to fix some major problems for once in their lives! That’s fun! As is the prospect of voting for a State Supreme Court Justice who isn’t a barely closeted Republican!! And down at the municipal level, we have the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever. We can replace an ineffective conservative city council member with an effective progressive city council member and show the current council that they only achieved their conservative majority thanks to big checks from corporations and the voter suppression inherent in holding city elections on odd-numbered years. Oh, and there’s a hugely important transportation levy we need to pass so that we can have sidewalks to walk on, to roll on, and to chalk up with abolitionist slogans. That’s a lot to consider! But that’s why the Stranger Election Control Board is here. We spent the last few months grilling candidates, analyzing platforms, digging up dirt, reading with great interest about the particulars of forest management and utility planning practices, and writing strongly worded emails, all to help you fill out your ballot swiftly and correctly. As ever, below you’ll find all the arguments we marshaled in support of our endorsements. If you don’t have time to read all of our bratty hectoring, then just jump straight to the Cheat Sheet. Your ballot should land in your mailbox soon. If you do not see it by October 21, then contact King County Elections as soon as possible to find out what the hell is going on. (You can reach them by phone at 206-296-VOTE [8683] or by email at elections@kingcounty.gov.) If you’re not registered to vote, then register online or by mail any time through October 28. If you’re unsure about your registration status, then check VoteWA. Once that big, thick ballot arrives, rip it open, select your favorite pen–any color will do!—and fill in the bubbles we tell you to fill in. Then slide the ballot into its funny little Hot Pocket sleeve, stuff the whole thing into the envelope, and then drop it in the mail by November 1st—no need for a stamp. If you’ve always wanted to be a mail carrier, or if you just like a little walk through the neighborhood, then skip the snail mail and slide your ballot into a nearby drop box no later than Tuesday, November 5 at 8 pm. And if all of this love and support and information makes you feel good on the inside, then please consider sending us a nice little tip! We know we just got bought by a rich guy, but he’s kind of banking on continued financial support for our readers. The Stranger Election Control Board is Hannah Krieg, Vivian McCall, Charles Mudede, Ashley Nerbovig, Megan Seling, Rich Smith, a working family, and Hannah Murphy Winter. The SECB does not endorse in uncontested races or in races we forgot. Before we dig into the particulars of each of these initiatives, you need to know a couple things up front. First, all of these measures more or less repeal laws that your duly elected officials passed in the last few years. Second, none of the laws are as cool as "Let’s Go Washington" makes them out to be. What is Let's Go Washington? Let us briefly explain. After the Republicans sold their brains to Donald Trump, they discovered that they could not win majorities in Washington State government. In an attempt to assert minority rule here, a wealthy hedge fund manager named Brian Heywood grabbed the torch from convicted campaign finance violator Tim Eyman and decided to try burning the government to the ground via the state’s easily gameable initiative process. So Heywood founded a PAC called "Let's Go Washington" and dropped a few million dollars to fund signature-gathering campaigns to kill several laws that he and his rich friends didn't like, mostly because they cut into the profits that he and his rich friends do like. Four of those initiatives ultimately made it to the ballot. Now, Heywood and his industry backers probably know they can’t win their arguments on the merits, but they might be able to use their considerable wealth to trick 50.01 percent of the state’s voters into believing a whole lot of bullshit, and so here we are voting on I-2066, an electrification ban that they’re framing as the repeal of a gas ban. And if these absolute virgins win ANY of these initiatives, then they will keep spending their pocket change to gum up the political process in this state until the end of our days. For that reason alone, you should vote NO on I-2066 and the rest of these initiatives on this ballot, but if you need other reasons, then let’s get into it. As we mentioned earlier, conservatives spin I-2066 as a repeal of a “natural gas ban” that state lawmakers passed earlier this year. We fucking wish state lawmakers banned “natural” methane gas this year, but they did not. Here’s what happened. Back in 2008, legislators passed a law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by certain amounts over the course of a number of years. In 2020, they updated that law. All told, the law says we need to reduce emissions by 95 percent in about 25 years. If Heywood and his buds really wanted to repeal a “gas ban,” then they would try to repeal that old/updated law. But even they know they’ll lose if they try to tilt their lances at our pollution reduction goals, so instead they’re trying to stop the state from actually doing anything to achieve that goal. One of the many things the state actually did to help achieve that goal was pass a bill to require Puget Sound Energy (PSE), “one of the largest producers of greenhouse gas pollution in the state,” to “plan for a plan” to do its part to reduce emissions in a way that doesn’t screw over poor people, to quote the bill’s sponsor, Democratic state Senator Joe Nguyen. The nerdier summary of the legislation will mean even less to you, unless you work in middle management at a utility company: Instead of forcing PSE to continue sending regulators separate plans to manage its electric and gas lines, this bill streamlines that process by allowing the company to send along a joint gas and electric plan. It’s classic, incremental, business-friendly climate policy. The bill came about because, though the initiative-backers don’t want to admit it, decarbonization is already happening. According to PSE, natural gas use is already “down 7% for residential and 3% for commercial customers in 2023 and forecasted to continue to decline over the next five years.” Accordingly, "Electricity use is increasing and forecasted to continue to rise." The utility needs to plan for this decline in a way that doesn’t leave people with low incomes in the lurch. If they don’t make those plans, then prices for some people hooked on natural gas could shoot up as much as 900 percent, according to one former California utility commissioner, as everyone else switches to more energy-efficient appliances. I-2066 would repeal key parts of the law that give PSE some tools to prevent those kinds of crazy price spikes, better serve customers, and protect the environment all at the same time. For instance, the initiative kills a provision that allows the PSE to ask regulators if it could pretty please offer incentives to customers in certain areas to switch to electric appliances rather than, say, having to replace a bunch of costly, aging gas infrastructure just to serve a few people. Because the bill gives PSE tools like that to decarbonize, initiative-backers are calling it “a gas ban,” but it’s just not. Unfortunately, state law requires PSE to provide natural gas to any customer with gas hookups who wants it. The law that I-2066 partly repeals does not change the utility’s “obligation to serve” those customers, so it’s not a fucking gas ban, and every time they say it’s a fucking gas ban, they’re betting you’re a fucking idiot who doesn’t know how to read. Anyway, the initiative does something worse than making PSE more climate friendly: It actually adds language that forbids the state from doing anything to “in any way prohibit, penalize, or discourage the use of gas for any form of heating, or for uses related to any appliance or equipment, in any building.” In other words, this initiative would prevent the state from trying to electrify anything in any building, despite the fact that emissions from buildings represent a quarter of our greenhouse gas pollution. It’s pure climate arson. But this initiative’s supporters don’t want you to focus on that reality. They want to keep you hooked on fossil fuels. To scare you into thinking that’s a good idea, they fearmonger about the upfront cost of electric appliance conversions. However, as we’ve mentioned, the state isn’t forcing anyone to electrify their homes or businesses. It does offer lots of generous subsidies for those interested in doing so, but if this initiative passes, then those subsidies will be just one lawsuit away from evaporating–along with our dreams of a cleaner, greener Washington. Vote no. This crackpot initiative would repeal the state’s new capital gains tax and cut $2.2 billion for education, early learning services, and child care at a time when schools across the state face huge deficits. Aside from dramatically reducing funding for schools, passing this initiative would help restore Washington’s status as the state with the most unfair tax code for poor people, all in the service of helping our wealthiest residents dodge a tax that their accountants might mistake as a rounding error. The capital gains tax skims 7 percent in profits from stocks and bonds and other assets over $262,000. Unfortunately, the tax doesn’t apply to the sales of homes, small businesses, farm land, farm equipment, livestock, timberland, commercial fishing, and auto dealership sales, so it hits fewer than 4,000 people in a state of 8 million, a little less than half of whom file taxes. If you’re reading this, then there’s a 99.9% chance that you do not pay this tax. The arguments that right-wingers use to support this initiative match the ones they used against the tax as it ping-ponged around the Legislature for ten years, but let’s rehearse them again for old times’ sake. They argue wealthy people “may relocate” due to the tax, but studies have shown that people don’t often move as a result of state taxes. That makes a lot of sense for this tax in particular, given that 41 other states also impose a capital gains tax. The right also says the tax “makes our state less competitive.” That doesn’t seem to be the case. In 2024, Oxford Economics ranked Seattle the 4th best city in the world based on our “economics.” The top three cities were located in California and New York, both of which levy capital gains taxes. Finally, Republicans also argue that the capital gains tax is a slippery slope to an income tax. Again, WE WISH. Last session, the Democrats, who control all branches of government, adopted a Brian Heywood-funded initiative that banned the passage of an income tax in Washington state. So state lawmakers can’t even do the cool thing and pass an income tax to put the question to the State Supreme Court anyway. Fuck that. Vote no. This initiative would repeal the Climate Commitment Act (CCA) and prohibit the state from ever implementing a similar law, cutting billions of dollars in funding for transit programs, ferries, clean energy projects, air quality improvement, and a bunch of other stuff that’s good for the environment and for the organisms who live in it, including the filthy rich psychopaths who got this initiative on the ballot. The CCA established a cap-and-trade system similar to the ones run by a collection of northeastern states, the European Union, and California-Quebec. Our version aims to lower Washington’s carbon emissions by 95 come 2050 in accordance with state law. To help hit that target, the state sets an emissions cap and then regularly holds auctions where polluters can buy and sell permits that allow them to comply with the cap while continuing to pollute. As the cap lowers, the price of these allowances rises, which incentivizes polluters to find ways to lower their emissions. Voila, a market-based way to curb carbon emissions. Since this system launched in 2023, it’s generated more than $2 billion, which the state plowed into a bunch of accounts and subaccounts that are too boring to describe. Importantly, 35 percent of the money must “provide a direct benefit to vulnerable populations within overburdened communities” and “10 percent of auction funds must be used for projects with Tribal support.” So far, proceeds from this bill have funded free transit for all Washingtonians under the age of 19, electric school buses, electric vehicle chargers, air quality monitoring, and a $200 electricity bill rebate for thousands of Washington families. The rest of the spending plan, which is quite long, includes grants to fund public transit, bike lanes, sidewalks, solar projects, and green infrastructure jobs. There’s also millions to help people weatherize their homes and switch to energy-efficient heat pumps; millions for fish passage projects, habitat restoration, and Native land-back initiatives; millions for shore power electrification and electric ferries; and half a billion for clean buildings. The right’s entire argument in support of setting a match to all that goes like this: 1) We think the CCA raised gas prices by 40 cents, and we cannot abide such a horror. 2) We shouldn’t fight climate change in Washington because our carbon emissions amount to a drop in the bucket compared to China and India and blah blah blah. To support their first point, they cite a Seattle Times analysis of numbers from the Oil Price Information Service showing gas prices steadily climbing from Jan 2023 and spiking in June of 2023 at 50 cents more per gallon. Washington’s prices ran higher than Oregon’s during that time period, and so the Oil Price Information Service blamed the CCA for the rise. It may be true that fossil fuel companies passed along some, all, or much more than all of the compliance costs to consumers while raking in huge profits in 2023, but we can’t know for sure because the Legislature failed to pass a bill that would have given us insight into those numbers. However, the Clean and Prosperous Institute looked at WA’s gas prices for all of 2023–not just the first six months like the Oil Price Information Service did–and found that the 50-cent spike was an outlier, and that “the full-year average (including July) was just 13.4 cents per gallon.” And, according to AAA, Washington tallied its highest-ever recorded gas price in 2022–a year before the state implemented the CCA. But let’s accept for the moment that oil companies saddled consumers with higher gas prices because they’ll take any and every excuse to do that. Repealing this law will blow a massive hole in the state’s 16-year transportation budget, and state lawmakers will absolutely raise the gas tax to help fill that gap because they sure as hell aren’t going to refrain from buying the ferries they need to buy or from fixing the bridges they need to fix just because some rich people didn’t want fossil fuel companies to pay to pollute. With the CCA intact, at least we get investments in transit options that will help us stop using our cars so much, plus more energy-efficient appliances that will save us money, oh, and CLEANER FUCKING AIR TO BREATHE. As far as the right’s baby-brained comparison between emissions in Washington and China goes: Sure, yeah, it’s true, Washington’s current emissions amount to a drop in the bucket compared to China’s. But obviously, greenhouse gasses are cumulative–it actually does help not to put more of that shit in the air. Moreover, we set the pace for other states and smaller countries around the world. If we prove that this model can work to curb emissions, then others will catch on, and we’ll have a cleaner, greener world for all. Vote no. Though our present gerontocracy suggests otherwise, we’re currently wading through the largest wave of people hitting the retirement age in American history. This “silver tsunami” wildly increases the demand for long-term health care, which is a nice way of describing the kind of care that involves paying someone to come wipe asses, pull up pants, and generally help our sick and dying family members age with dignity while the rest of us toil away at our jobs. Seventy percent of us will need this care after age 65, but less than 5 percent of us buy it on the private market because the premiums are sky-high and growing higher, the coverage is skimpy and getting skimpier, and people with serious pre-existing conditions are, for the most part, ineligible. People assume Medicare will cover this kind of care, but it doesn’t really. Medicaid kinda does, but to access that care you need to spend down your life savings and literally impoverish yourself, which isn’t exactly ideal. Moreover, if a bunch of our elders impoverished themselves just to qualify for Medicaid, they’d basically bankrupt the state. That’s where WA Cares comes in. At this very moment, around 3.9 million working Washingtonians are paying 58 cents on every 100 dollars we make for a first-in-the-nation long-term health care benefit. Come 2026, the state will grant anyone who pays into it $36,500, which will increase with inflation, to deal with stuff that medical insurance doesn’t normally pay for. If an auntie comes over ten hours a week to help dad get around, then he can use this money to pay her for that. If mom’s getting too old to cook for herself, then she can use this money to have meals delivered. And if your bright and youthful self needs money to pay for a temporary caregiver and an ADA-compliant home after getting hit by a car while crossing E. Olive Street and Harvard Avenue because the Seattle Department of Transportation took its SWEET ASS TIME painting a crosswalk there, then you can tap this benefit to pay for all that, too. But not if this initiative passes. Rather than automatically paying into the benefit, just like Social Security or anything else, I-2124 would force all workers to voluntarily opt into it. Imposing this new rule would likely lead to lots of people dropping from the benefit or never signing up to begin with, which will kill the whole thing. An analysis from the Office of State Actuary ran five different scenarios if this initiative passes, and every one of them led to the insolvency and elimination of the benefit by 2027. But we wouldn’t just lose the benefit that so many of us are paying into. The state would have to hire people to slowly tear down the system, which would cost between $12.6 and $31 million per year over the course of three years, according to an analysis from the Office of Financial Management. In essence, this initiative would make us pay to fuck ourselves, which we only like doing for free, thank you very much. The destruction of this benefit would come down hardest on women in general and on women of color in particular, a disproportionately high number of whom work as unpaid caregivers. It’d also fuck over the LGBTQ community, which faces high rates of financial insecurity and is less likely to have family around to help out as they age. The right-wingers who back this initiative have never seen a safety net they didn’t want to shred to pieces, so they dance around the catastrophic fallout that would result from WA Cares’ failure and argue that this initiative simply aims to offer workers a choice. But the choice is a false one–as we mentioned, the miniscule private long-term health care insurance market is totally broken, and, oh yeah, it charges women up to 70 percent more than men. Others rightfully groan about the relatively low amount of the benefit–$36,000 tied to inflation. We hear ya. We, too, would like a universal health care system that takes care of everything. But until then, we’ll have to deal with Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and all these other earned benefits that don’t quite cover the full cost of everything we need to simply live. Vote no. We here on the Stranger Election Control Board assume that every voter who picks up our (legally binding) voter’s guide wants to vote. In that spirit, you should vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz over Donald Trump. As president, Harris promises to do whatever polls well at the moment with certain key demographics in certain key states that she needs to win because this country still uses an antiquated and racist election system to pick its top executive. But it’s not like that means she’s offering nothing that will directly improve our lives. In general, she wants to make permanent a lot of stuff that worked during the first few years of the COVID crisis. She aims to restore the $3,600-per-kid tax credit and raise it to $6,000 per kid for the first year of their lives, which will take a big chunk out of child poverty. For the childless cat ladies among us, she wants to expand the $1,500 Earned Income Tax Credit to a larger swath of working people. She also plans to keep the Obamacare tax credits and cap insulin prices at $35 for everyone, not just the elderly. Vowing to “build on” all the good work the Biden administration did for the climate, she’ll keep juicing the green energy economy and giving us money for switching to more energy-efficient appliances. To prove she’s heard our cries about the housing crisis, she will attempt to increase a tax credit that makes affordable housing easier to build, give a tax cut to developers who build homes that “working families” can afford, crack down on price-fixing landlords, offer $25,000 to help cover the downpayment on a first home, and give tax breaks to startups and to manufacturing companies who keep jobs in the country, all while “cutting red tape” to boost housing production and new business applications. Of course, every one of those insufficient but noble policy goals requires Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, which she is very unlikely to get. As president, she has much more control over agency rulemaking, immigration, and national security. On those issues, she has much less to say about what she’ll do with her power. Higher-education advocates question her support for canceling more student debt than Biden. She and every other Democrat made a hard-right turn on immigration. Her foreign policy strategy does not appear to depart with Biden’s in any meaningful way. But no other candidate on the ballot has a snowball’s chance in hell of beating former President Donald Trump, who holds the most insane stance you could possibly hold on every single one of those issues, whose stated policy proposals will dramatically increase inflation, end American democracy as we know it, and endanger the lives of every marginalized group in the country, including the deluded bumpkins who hold him up as their savior. So you should also vote for Harris and Walz in the spirit of stopping a fucking wannabe fascist dictator from taking over the fucking country again, only this time for good. Many of you may have understandably blacked out the Trump years, or maybe some of you weren’t that tapped into politics back then. You didn’t wake in a cold panic to the push-alert about the Muslim ban and then rush to rally at the airport, didn’t fill with rage as you listened to audio of a border patrol officer belittling babies as they cried out for the mothers they’d been torn away from, didn’t spend evenings at town halls trying to convince Republicans to stop trying to kick millions of people off of their health insurance, didn’t watch your rent rise as Trump signed massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, didn’t go bankrupt as his education secretary fucked over student loan borrowers, didn’t go hungry when he made food stamps harder to get, didn’t have to tighten your belt as he undermined worker protection after worker protection, didn’t light a candle for Mother Earth as he gutted nearly every environmental protection he could find, didn’t protest as he set the stage for the genocide in Gaza, didn’t start forking over hundreds of dollars you couldn’t afford to abortion funds and the like as he filled the Supreme Court with Heritage Foundation goons, didn’t talk to literally any woman during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, didn’t wake up more or less on edge every day for four years, thinking it plausible that at any given moment that fucking moron in the White House could start World War III on a whim. Well, it fucking sucked. And with Project 2025 giving him a blueprint for putting more power in his hands, it’s going to fucking suck more. And make no mistake: Trump is still no friend to anyone but himself, and he’s definitely no friend to the left. In his 4th of July address, he compared “the radical left” to Nazis and vowed to target “the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters.” He also “promised to crush pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses” and to deport any protesters from foreign countries. Remember the “snatch vans” during the 2020 protests? Those rolled out under Trump’s administration. In October of this year, he doubled down on all of that, flagging for “removal” anyone who he deems antisemitic, including pro-Palestine protesters, journalists, and members of the Democratic Party. The left’s first order of business is to stop the rise of fascism. Voting for the person who is most likely to bury a fascist’s political career will help do that. Yes, Harris’s decision to continue enabling Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza presents voters of conscience with an urgent moral question. But we live in a fallen world. Voting in the general election is a zero sum game, it’s realistically a binary choice, and picking the lesser of two evils is actually a worthwhile thing to do, especially when, in this case, the more evil one will make sure you never get the chance to make that choice again. He already tried to stop the peaceful transition of power last time. If we hand him the presidency after inspiring an insurrection and trying to work the refs to overthrow the results, then there won’t be another transition until he dies. Sure, Washington reliably votes for the Democratic presidential candidate, so your decision to skip that race won't directly lead to the election of a madman who wants you dead. But by that same logic, not voting for Harris really doesn’t make much of a statement, either. Some local consultant might remark that Harris lost a few thousand votes relative to Biden in Washington, maybe, and that will be the end of that. So, in that context, how big of a moral stand is a protest vote for Jill Stein? How little of a “reward” are you denying the establishment? Conversely, a vote for Harris will make your voice stronger when you do–as we all should do–continue to push her administration to stop sending arms to Israel until they agree to a ceasefire. A vote for Harris could lend you credibility when you try to convince your family members and friends in swing states to vote for her. And, perhaps most importantly, electing Harris will prevent the likes of Mayor Bruce Harrell and Council President Sara Nelson from becoming the faces of the #Resistance like Jenny Durkan, Ed Murray, and the rest of those losers were during those dark and cringy pussy hat days. It’s not much, but in the general election under the electoral college in Washington State, that’s about as much as a presidential vote counts. Vote Harris and Walz. Returning US Senator Maria Cantwell to Congress will contribute to a Democratic majority that we need to obstruct a Trump administration or else help a Harris administration move policy forward, which is good. But we’ll be honest: Cantwell’s not our favorite Democrat. We can’t help but fantasize about her retiring and then watching Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal take her place. That said, Cantwell has made some moves we gotta respect. She was the brains behind the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which may create 4,000 new semiconductor manufacturing jobs right here in the U.S. of A. Thanks to her, the University of Washington snagged a cool $10 million to train the future semiconductor whizzes. She hasn’t shied away from calling out Boeing for their lackadaisical oversight and their airplane doors popping off mid-flight, which we appreciate. She also collabed with Republican US House Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers this year on the American Privacy Rights Act, which would set national data privacy rights and hold violators accountable. We would like the strongest possible privacy rights to protect data in our period-trackers, our step-counter apps, and our OnlyFans watch history. That shit’s between us and God, not advertisers, cops, or any other third party. If we give her another term, Cantwell will keep fighting to get that bill across the finish line Let’s get one thing straight, though: Neither one of Washington’s senators has done enough to stop the genocide in Gaza. A senator with a conscience would make quicker, clearer, and more frequent calls for a ceasefire, and they would block weapons to Israel at every turn. Cantwell has utterly failed on that front. But we don’t think her competition, Republican Raul Garcia, will serve as a more passionate advocate for Palestinian liberation. For example, in a July Q & A, he said he would not set stricter conditions for sending bombs to Israel. Besides, he’s shady as fuck. He’s vowed to stay neutral in the upcoming presidential race, which means he wants Trump to win. If elected, Garcia said he would support the agenda of whichever presidential candidate wins, which he thinks is the role of Congress, which is funny because the role of Congress is to serve as a check on the Executive branch, but whatever. The point is: If Trump wins, then we want senators who push back on his bullshit, not senators who bend over and take it. Heck, if Harris wins, then we want senators who push back on her bullshit, too! We don’t have that option in these two candidates, but, still, Cantwell’s the best choice. Vote Cantwell. Well well well, what can we say about Congresswoman Suzan DelBene that anyone will remember five minutes from now? The earmarks she secured this year include enough money to finally complete the big Food and Farming Center up in Snohomish County, which will serve as a big ag hub and farmer’s market to help local growers distribute food from northwest Washington to the rest of the region. That sounds nice–as does the money to preserve some marshlands, upgrade some water infrastructure in Bothell, and design the Ash Way light rail station up in Everett. If we send her back to Congress for a seventh term, she vows to continue trying to pass legislation that polls well, such as bills to give people tax breaks for having children and developers tax breaks for building affordable housing. She heads up the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) because she’s apparently good at raising a lot of money and she enjoys the security of a safe blue seat. That’s kinda fun. For all her incrementalism and moderation, she’s a hell of a lot better than Republican Jeb Brewer, whose name and politics appear to derive from some generic GOP candidate generator. He’s mad about inflation, he’s mad about electric vehicles, and he thinks homelessness is a mental health/drug problem first and not a housing problem first. He’s also apparently a little bit of a moron. On his website, he argues that “Washington and our country are worse off today than two year [sic] ago,” which is why he’s running. Well, Jeb, we’re just humble cosmopolitans living in cities you call “decaying,” but we do know that a bunch of obstructionist Republicans took over the House two years ago, which partly explains why we’re worse off now. Do us all a favor and stop contributing to that problem. Vote DelBene. One of the reasons why we get so pissed about local conservatives identifying as “practical progressives” is because “practical progressives” actually do exist, and four-term Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal is one of them. As chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, she led the bloc of nearly 100 members as they rolled out the Progressive Proposition Agenda, which tried to push Biden to the left on climate, the economy, and everything else. When the Republicans are in charge, as they have been for the last couple of years, Jayapal tries to get things done by introducing bipartisan legislation. Recent efforts include bills to tamp down on anticompetitive hospital mergers, reduce wasteful war spending, and restore at least a little trust in Congress by preventing its members from owning and trading stocks. In lean times, she’s also not afraid to use the bully pulpit. She recently joined the Boeing machinists on the picket line to stand up for workers’ rights, and she regularly appears on TV to defend and advance progressive positions on immigration, Gaza, and data privacy. And after the Israeli Defense Forces killed Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, a University of Washington graduate who protested illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank, Jayapal joined forces with US Senator Patty Murray to write a letter demanding an investigation, signed onto another letter with 102 members of Congress demanding the same, and followed up with a fiery press release in early October when she didn’t see any movement from the State Department on that front. Give her a blue president and senate, and she’ll keep pushing to cancel more student debt, secure a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, reform the Supreme Court, increase protections for LGBTQ communities, and win higher pay for workers. Meanwhile, her Republican opponent, Dan Alexander, is basically nutso. Over the phone, he tells us he’s probably voting for Donald Trump this year because RFK Jr. supports Trump, and since he supports RFK Jr., then he’ll probably support Trump, too. He also peddled anti-vaxxer bullshit, saying that he couldn’t tell us if the COVID-19 vaccines were safe (they are!) and that his “understanding” was that the vaccines killed thousands of people (they haven’t). Not exactly the kind of views we like hearing from a longtime Boeing engineer who works on military versions of the 737, but there you have it! Vote Jayapal. As a pro-abortion pediatrician, three-term Congresswoman Kim Schrier will really shine when she inevitably has to play defense against Republicans as they attempt to gut earned benefits and impose national abortion bans. In that way, she’ll be an asset to a likely Democratic minority and to the country as a whole. Even when she served during the Trump administration, she chalked up a few wins. Her not-so-small list of bills signed by the bad man suggests she can find common ground with MAGA freaks, largely in the worlds of agriculture and conservation. Of course, her embrace of hard-right immigration policy, cops, and her support for Israel overlap with their interests as well, which does not bode well. Though Schrier now leans way more to the right than she has to, we’ll take her over Republican bank executive Carmen Goers any day. Goers refuses to entertain the notion of raising taxes despite the need to increase special education funding, speed along a just transition from fossil fuels, build around seven million affordable homes that the private sector simply will not build, and pay for about a thousand other things. She also holds anti-trans positions on kids sports and thinks schools have dropped standards “in order to prevent anyone from feeling bad,” which makes her, if nothing else, an absolutely tedious Thanksgiving dinner guest. Vote Schrier. Oh, look! A Congressional race where we had to make an interesting decision! Kind of! In terms of issue knowledge and policy imagination, grant writer and civil rights advocate Melissa Chaudhry represents the strongest challenge that 14-term Congressman Adam Smith has faced in recent memory. She presents detailed prescriptions for fixing our dismal and dehumanizing immigration system, increasing worker power, building more housing that people can afford, making our political processes more democratic, and supporting every other item we care about on the progressive agenda. Most importantly for this race, she also stands well to Smith’s left on foreign policy issues, particularly when it comes to Pentagon spending and Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza. Smith calls for a ceasefire, and yet he votes to send billions in weapons to Israel while blaming Hamas for being “the biggest obstacle to a ceasefire,” when reporting strongly points to the political ambition of Benjamin Netanyahu as the biggest obstacle to a ceasefire and the cause of war escalation in the region. Unlike Smith, Chaudhry doesn’t talk out of both sides of her mouth on this issue. She wouldn’t have voted to send Israel more bombs to drop on babies, wouldn’t have blocked funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees for a year, and would remain an outspoken critic of the US’s stance on this war until the killing stops. Unfortunately, though she makes a more persuasive case on many of these issues than Smith does, she has yet to raise the kind of money needed to make sure voters hear that case. Plus, Rep. Smith isn’t all bad. He helped lead the House Democrats’ call for Biden to step off the presidential ticket, nixed a few of the more heinous Republican amendments to the bill that authorizes Pentagon spending, and has tried this year to secure a bunch of funding for affordable housing units and community centers that serve marginalized communities. All of that is good, but it’s all stuff Chaudhry would do as a matter of course. Vote Chaudhry. Attorney General Bob Ferguson is the only candidate for governor prepared to lead Washington through its most pressing, ongoing issues: The housing crisis and the crisis in education funding. On housing, he’ll focus on increasing market-rate and affordable units in his first term, promising a cabinet-level agency to implement his top priority of building 200,000 new homes “using public-private partnerships” in four years. As for education, he plans to increase the percentage of the state budget devoted to funding the public education system. We believe he’ll follow through on his promises. When he first ran for Attorney General in 2012, he promised to be a consumer protection crusader, and more than a decade later he’s clawed back a couple billion dollars for the people of Washington, state and local government coffers, and nonprofits through his civil law enforcement division, including $1.1 billion to address the fentanyl epidemic. Promises made, promises kept, and then some. All of that is very nice. Unfortunately, like his GOP opponent, former US Representative Dave Reichert, Ferguson refuses to advocate for new taxes on the rich. Now, Reichert promises to veto any new taxes, which would be disastrous. And while Ferguson has supported the capital gains tax and taxes on big banks in the past, in interviews he routinely asserts the need for the state to cut waste, not to increase its coffers. And yet, he refuses to explain how cutting waste can generate enough dollars to fund all the stuff he says he wants. (Newsflash: It can’t.) Still, Ferguson’s tendency to pivot away from questions like a man with an avoidant attachment style raises far fewer concerns than the answers Reichert gives. Reichert supports school voucher programs, which would divert public dollars to private schools, exacerbating our education funding problems. He believes marriage is “between a man and a woman,” and while he promises not to foist his beliefs on the state, the friends he keeps raise eyebrows. He chose to hold his first town hall for his gubernatorial bid at Firmly Planted Action, anti-LGBTQ+ group that wants to end abortion rights. Plus, Larry Sandquist, board chairman of the Family Policy Institute of Washington, which actively advocates for anti-abortion policies, donated $5,000 to the pro-Reichert independent expenditure committee, Washington 24. Beyond that, his religious beliefs clearly do affect his policy choices, like in the area of climate change, which he doubts can be reversed because “the guy upstairs” controls the weather. Ferguson is not the lesser of two evils. He actively supports codifying a person’s right to abortion in the state constitution, and he’s fought vehemently in the past against LGBTQ+ discrimination. Under a Trump administration, Ferguson will fight to uphold those hard-won rights; under Harris, he’d move us forward, albeit *shudders* incrementally. Reichert would take us backward. Vote Ferguson. So you’ve gotten to the point in the ballot where you have to Google what the fuck the Lieutenant Governor even does. Don’t worry about it, baby girl. Bubble in the circle for Denny Heck and allow us to explain. The Lieutenant Governor serves as the president of the state Senate. While the position cannot cast a vote, the person who holds it gets to break ties and root for their policy goals. In his first term, Heck showed he knows how to use his clout to corral the cats in the Senate. For instance, he took major credit for the “Year of Housing” in 2023. He rallied a broad coalition of pro-housing advocacy groups to pressure legislators to pass a bunch of bills to promote density, including the crown jewel of the session, the so-called “missing middle housing” bill, which dramatically reformed zoning around the state. In 2025, he will advocate for lot-splitting measures, transit-oriented development, and other permitting reforms to build, build, build. If you noticed that Heck’s pushing a lot of supply-side strategies, you would be right (and maybe you should monitor your Urbanist Twitter screen time). He’s sort of lukewarm when it comes to helping renters keep their heads above water as he tries to build his way out of the crisis; the Senate killed the rent stabilization bill last session under his watch, and in his meeting with the SECB he offered no assurances that he would prevent that from happening again. In an ideal world, Heck would use his position of authority to send every rent stabilization holdout in the Senate to timeout until they’re ready to vote right, but we don’t live in an ideal world. We live in a world where we have Heck, who takes the housing crisis seriously, and Republican Dan Matthews, who is too busy obsessing over the genitals of athletes to cheerlead for market urbanism. Vote Heck. Incumbent Steve Hobbs did a pretty good job in his first term as Secretary of State, and we want to see what he can do with another one. Let’s start with the good stuff. Hobbs takes voter outreach very seriously. In fact, he hired a whole team to help disenfranchised voters cast their ballots. After a 2021 law reinstated voting rights for incarcerated people upon release, he established a new civics course to encourage them to vote. Incidentally, he also got Dungeons & Dragons unbanned from prisons, which counts as lawful good behavior if we’ve ever seen it. If we give him another term, he’ll scale up those efforts. But Hobbs has some work to do. His office rejected more ballots from people of color and young people than from white people and older people. To combat that disparity, he wants to start a program to allow voters to “cure” their ballots via text message. His office also rejected almost 70,000 ballots in the presidential primary because voters failed to check a box to denote party affiliation, which they don’t have to do in other elections. Advocates would have Hobbs get rid of that box altogether, but such a change would require action from the Legislature, and he thinks the political parties would probably fight that effort so they could keep collecting data. Nevertheless, he’s establishing a work group to find solutions. And, fuck it, we’ll say it. Hobbs is a Democrat and his opponent, Dale Whitaker, is a Republican. Call us a bunch of soy libs, but after former President Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, we don’t really trust Republicans to head our Secretary of State’s office. Whitaker did not agree to an interview with us, but we wanted to grill him on why he opposes Hobbs’s efforts to combat online disinformation following the insurrection, on what basis he spreads the myth that undocumented people stuff our ballot boxes, and, to be frank, we wanted to ask him who he thinks won the 2020 election. Sorry, but a Republican with no experience running on “election integrity” in the year 2024 rings alarm bells that Whitaker failed to silence. Vote Hobbs. Incumbent Democratic Treasurer Ben Gibbard Mike Pellicciotti has managed our state finances so well that even his Republican opponent openly admits that we're in a “good position.” Stone-cold reality forces her to concede that point. Under Pellicciotti’s leadership, in June Moody’s gave Washington a triple-A rating due to our “strong governance practices and sound reserve and liquidity positions,” which means we govern well, save enough for rainy days, and still have money to get shit done. Meanwhile, this year Standard & Poor’s maintained Washington’s AA+ rating, and they even moved our economic outlook from “stable” to “positive," which means our credit fucking rules. In fact, in terms of our credit rating and our pension fund liability, US News and World Report ranked Washington #1 in the country this year. Aside from serving as a faithful steward of public funds, we like Pellicciotti for his obsession with long-term thinking, a quality so many public officials sorely lack. In his first term, he goaded the Legislature into passing Washington Saves, a state-run, automatic retirement savings account that will serve the 1.2 million Washingtonians who do not have access to such a benefit through their employers. If we return him to office, he vows to continue pushing for his baby bonds proposal, which would give every child born on Medicaid tens of thousands of dollars they could tap into at 18 to help launch a new business, or to pay for college or vocational school. Pellicciotti argues that this kind of policy will give us all “the hope and promise of a future where everyone can reach their full potential,” so that the 14-year-old going into high school will have some real financial help to look forward to after graduation. And right now, he’s drawing up plans to Trump-proof Washington state. Few may remember in the chaos of, well, everything, but in 2020 then-President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from Seattle. You better believe that Project 2025 Trump will withhold federal funding from Washington State if he doesn’t like the way we, say, support trans kids in school or try to reduce carbon emissions. So Pellicciotti’s in the lab looking at budgets, trying to figure out what he can backfill with state funds in the advent of the worst thing that could happen to America. We can’t say the same for his Republican opponent, Sharon Hanek, who co-founded Let’s Go Washington with Brian Heywood, the multimillionaire hedge fund manager responsible for all the apocalyptic initiatives on the ballot this year. According to a questionnaire for a religious voter guide, she not only opposes taking into consideration environmental, social, and governance ratings when deciding where to invest public funds, as Pellicciotti does, she also opposes abortion, medical abortion, marriage equality (which she brags about trying to overturn), trans rights, and every other thing we care about. You will not be surprised to learn that she believes “laws to control gun ownership have gone too far.” Well, we don't! Vote Pellicciotti. Everyone’s worried about government fraud, waste, and abuse, but we’d bet our second-best bong that 9 out of 10 people at the bar couldn’t tell you the name of Washington’s two-term incumbent state auditor, Pat McCarthy. And probably 10 out of 10 people at the bar couldn’t tell you that she’s done such a good job overseeing the place–with one somewhat major exception–that it’s won THREE national awards for excellence since 2020. In 2020, the National State Auditors Association (NSAA) gave the agency an award for its mildly thrilling investigation that turned up a former Pierce County Housing Authority finance director who stole $7 million in a fraud scheme. In 2022, the department picked up another award for performing a “culture audit” of the Department of Fish and Wildlife—“the only one in the country ever conducted that we’re aware of,” McCarthy says. The audit uncovered a widespread culture of bullying. And this year, the NSAA bestowed an award upon the agency for its Cyber Checkups program. The “popularity” of the Auditor’s cyber security programs, which help local governments learn where they’re most vulnerable to attack, led to a three-year backup for services. In response to the growing queue, the agency developed the “checkup” program to give governments a few more tools in their toolbox that they could use to avoid cyber attacks while they wait for a proper audit–and everybody loves it. The cyber security award seems a little funny after a vendor the auditor’s office used experienced a major data breach in 2020 that exposed the sensitive data of more than one million people. McCarthy’s office didn’t reveal the breach for three weeks. She argues the department acted quickly and needed that time to “verify the scope of the vendor’s breach.” Since then, McCarthy says, she’s created a Data Risk Committee to identify and clean up the agency’s data request process, “worked with the state’s IT agency and Microsoft to create a customized data sharing platform called SAOShare, and supported and implemented legislation requiring annual data sharing agreements with the 2,300 governments and state agencies we audit.” So she took the breach seriously and then took steps to make sure it wouldn’t happen again. Plus, that little hiccup isn’t the total expression of McCarthy’s being. We’re impressed, for instance, with the way she embraced the task of auditing investigations of incidents when police use deadly force, a new duty the Legislature gave her early in her second term. In the face of some grumbling from law enforcement, she says she set up the system quickly and welcomed it as a way of “holding everyone accountable.” If we give her another shot, she plans to continue to strengthen the department’s inclusivity practices and to look into ways to offer performance audits to tribes who’ve expressed interest in finding efficiencies. Speaking of finding efficiencies, she’s also put together “a small task force” to look into ways to use artificial intelligence. “On the one hand, I know AI is going to destroy civilization as we know it. On the other hand, it could provide efficiencies,” she says. That’s the kind of level-headed approach to certain doom that we like to see in an auditor. And she’s a hell of a lot better than her Republican opponent, Matt Hawkins, an “election integrity” guy who helped produce an alarming number of children (10), uses Qanon-y phrases like “We the People” in his campaign copy, and clearly does not understand the basic functions of the office he seeks. He thinks, for example, that the auditor oversees elections—it doesn’t. Vote McCarthy. Nick Brown’s years of experience working with the Washington State Attorney General’s Office (AGO) as general counsel for Governor Jay Inslee and his values on topics such as gun safety and abortion make him the best choice to serve as our next Attorney General (AG). Brown can show up on day one ready to defend our laws, provide state agencies with the legal advice they need, and fight for consumers against big business. As gun violence continues to rip through communities, Brown argues for reducing the number of guns on the street as a key way to lower the number of homicides and suicides. Meanwhile, his GOP opponent, Pasco Mayor Pete Serrano, spends his off-time fighting for the rights of Washington gun dealers to sell assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as seeking to overturn the state’s ban on “ghost guns.” Serrano’s choice to attack these laws shows a disregard for public safety, as studies show again and again that stricter gun laws can result in less gun violence, and laws such as the ones we have on the books may have prevented mass shootings. His stance on the issue also displays how out-of-step he is with Washington voters, who in 2018 passed a suite of gun safety laws through Initiative 1639. Brown would also better represent the interests of Washingtonians on abortion. Seventy-three percent of the state believes abortion should be legal in most or all cases, and while both Brown and Serrano promised to protect access to the pills and procedures, Serrano refused to guarantee he’d enforce the state’s “shield law,” which makes us a safe haven for those fleeing prohibition states just to get health care. Brown vows to fight to keep those laws on the books. While Serrano argues that “excessive” consumer protection litigation amounts to an abuse of the AGO’s power, Brown promises to put consumers first. He’ll fight companies that plot to increase rent prices, do a better job of overseeing compliance with the Landlord-Tenant Act, and establish a new unit to actively investigate and punish wage theft. Finally, Brown just has the most relevant experience for the job. As former US District Attorney for Western Washington, he already knows how to run a large public firm. In our interview, he ticked off several ways to make law departments at the state and county levels run more smoothly, most of which dealt with more frequent and more thorough communication practices. Not as flashy of a topic as abortion or gun control, but we do love a bureaucrat who gets fired up about making small but meaningful changes to operations. A vote for Brown means Washington can continue to progress on all the issues we care about, whereas a vote for Serrano installs someone who plans to pick and choose which laws he’ll fight for based on his political preferences, not the will of elected legislators. Vote Brown. The next leader of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), a large agency that oversees Washington’s 5.6 million acres of public lands, will either be a Republican who takes money from lumber companies or a Democrat who takes money from environmentalists. For the sake of all that is green and blue and clear and good, we strongly encourage you to vote for the latter and more aptly named option, Dave Upthegrove. If the Lorax wasn’t already incredibly gay, we’d call Upthegrove the gay Lorax. As the head of the DNR, he plans to beef up community wildfire resilience efforts, meaningfully increase the frequency of tribal consultation when citing green energy projects, and continue the agency’s new program to set aside 10,000 acres of forest for carbon sequestration, all while trying to preserve structurally complex forests—colloquially known as “mature legacy forests”—from the buzzsaw. Though we know lumber groups and conservative counties will fight the agency on all of that, we’re confident that Upthegrove’s experience will allow him to win the day. His years as a State House Representative means he knows which arms to twist and which mouths to feed to get stuff done, and his years representing south King County on the King County Council give us faith in his ability to oversee policy implementation. Our lands would fare much better in Upthegrove’s hands than they would in the hands of Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, who boasts a 14 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters because of all the anti-environment votes she took during her time in Congress. Recently, she voted against the Inflation Reduction Act, against cracking down on oil industry price gouging, against protecting public lands and waters across the west (seriously), and the list goes on because she’s a fucking Republican. Of course, we know she doesn’t care what environmentalists think of her record, as she referred to those who oppose her as “extremist groups particularly in one part of the state” who “want to see things preserved” but "oftentimes they apply very old science.” The “old science” she’s talking about refers to efforts to preserve the state’s mature legacy forests, most of which were logged before the 1940s and haven’t been touched since. The science she’s leaving out isn’t old but actually new science that says biodiversity is good, and that we shouldn’t cut down a bunch of old trees that do a really good job of storing carbon, maintaining healthy watersheds, and serving as places to walk around and stand in awe of nature. She should read it sometime! Also, we made the following argument in our primary endorsement, but it bears repeating. We expect not a little discrimination against Upthegrove for being a member of the King County liberal elite telling a bunch of country folk how best to tend their lands. We reject this line of thinking because it fails to acknowledge the “elites” in the timber industry keeping small towns dependent on one crop—trees—and then holding a knife to their throats whenever a conservationist suggests that we might, perhaps, in the midst of a mass extinction, try to increase biodiversity while simultaneously diversifying local economies. As we said in July, the choice between saving the trees and saving rural economies is a false one—we can and should do both. And there’s real urgency here, too. Thanks to some court cases going the right way, the DNR has more latitude to find creative ways to manage and monetize lands that don’t involve destroying them. We need to seize those opportunities now. Vote Upthegrove. Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal’s experience as a teacher, his three terms as a state lawmaker, and his two terms leading this office through the pandemic and the fog of America’s (latest) stupid culture wars make him the only real choice in this race. Under Reykdal, who grew up poor and who credits his ascendence to public education, more children are receiving free meals. More schools are offering dual-language programs. He’s got a plan to continue diversifying the workforce and to retain more teachers of color, and he’s made a commitment to protecting marginalized students and teachers from an onslaught of conservative attacks on our education system. After some mixture of cowardice and cunning convinced the Legislature to pass the so-called “Parents Bill of Rights,” a right-wing initiative from our old pal, hedge fund manager Brian Heywood, this summer Reykdal rightly directed the agency to ignore it until the courts and other institutions provided clarity on a number of issues. That’s the kind of direction we can get behind. (We also like him because we saw him at Pride and he seemed happy to see all the gay people.) Now, a lot of people are pissed at our education system right now, but laying the blame squarely at his feet makes no sense. Our schools are starved for funds, and Reykdal can only ask legislators for more money–he does not control how much he gets. His latest budget request–$2.9 billion–will get us way closer to the bare minimum he says we need to run our classrooms, fund special education, pay teachers a fair wage, and put kids on the bus. The GOP’s pick for superintendent, David Olson, throws up about a thousand red flags. The former Navy welder and diver has been on Peninsula School District’s board for nearly 11 years, and he’s a friend to fringey right-wingers. His district boasts higher-than-average academic achievement numbers, but for some reason he told the GOP convention in Spokane that we’d save America if every student went into the trades and every four-year university went bankrupt. We love the trades, but that kinda anti-school talk seems pretty radical coming from a guy who wants to run the schools. The proudly anti-DEI Olson claims to stop short of wanting to ban books. Instead, he tells parents who are upset about trans children playing sports to join their local chapter of the book-banning political extremists, Mom’s for Liberty. And–wouldn’t you know it–the PSD school board meetings have been full of parents and students who say racist and anti-queer bullying is a problem in the district! Huh! Wonder what’s up there? Wonder if anyone could use some training in diversity, equity, and inclusion? Hm! Putting Olson in charge would be a disaster. Remember, the superintendent isn’t just the bag man. The position comes with the statutory power to choose when and what kids learn. Vote Reykdal. Democratic state Senator Patty Kuderer’s experience in employment law, her legislative track record on insurance policy, and the fact that she doesn’t spend her time on the Senate floor saying some of the craziest shit imaginable makes her far and away a better candidate than Republican state Senator Phil Fortunato, an absolute dodo bird who, nevertheless, earns some respect from the SECB for picking up the phone when we call. Anyway, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner recently experienced a lot of upheaval and turnover following a slew of complaints against outgoing incumbent Commissioner Mike Kreidler. Kuderer’s background as an attorney who has represented victims of workplace discrimination will help the agency heal, regrow, and hopefully safeguard against any future bullshit. In terms of policy, Kuderer earned the SECB’s respect not only for picking up the phone when we call but for beating the extremely powerful and extremely annoying landlord lobby to pass a number of moderate renter protections. As she has with tenants as a senator, she plans to focus on advocating for consumers rather than a bunch of vampiric insurance companies. She also aims to continue to “pursue” the establishment of a regional, single-payer health care system, require gun-owners to buy insurance to cover negligence and accidents, and expand the Insurance Fair Conduct Act to make the claims process fairer. Unfortunately, she doesn’t want to regulate the industry to the point where she’s “strangling businesses,” but we’ll take her approach over Fortunato’s, a man who, to cite one recent facepalm moment, defended the rights of Catholic priests not to tell law enforcement if someone confesses to raping a kid. As for his views regarding the work of the Insurance Commissioner, his public-facing materials offer only some typical Republican pablum about wanting to deregulate the industry to increase competition. For some reason, his website doesn’t really mention his strident opposition to abortion, the “Don’t Say Gay” in schools bill he introduced this session, his opposition to common sense gun laws, or anything else that would reveal him as widely out of touch with most Washingtonians. Vote Kuderer. State House Representative Bill Ramos threw his hat in the ring to replace state Senator Mark Mullet after Mullet skipped off to run an inarguably silly campaign for governor. In almost every conceivable way, Ramos represents a major upgrade. For one, Ramos voted yes on the House’s version of an anti-rent gouging bill that Mullet helped to kill. If the same bill came before Ramos again, he said he’d vote for it. Hoorah. But he’s not just better on tenant issues. During his five years in the House, he picked some worthy issues to champion. He helped craft Washington’s $17 billion transportation funding package back in 2022, which included about a billion to fund pedestrian walkways and bike paths, with some dollars set aside to build these paths in historically underserved communities. He generally stressed the importance of paying attention to equity issues when designing transportation, which we love to hear. In-between his transportation work, he took on the project of combating violent domestic extremism. The bill he sponsored would establish a commission to study the issue and recommend some concrete proposals to address it, including looking at a public health approach. He says protesters chanted outside his office “for weeks” before the bill ultimately died in the House. Despite the backlash he received, including at times from his own neighbors, he plans to try again next year. He has reliably supported policies to increase funding for education, transit, and environmental protections, which is more than we can say for his Republican opponent, Chad Magendanz, who loves charter schools so much that he sponsored the bill that kept them open back when the State Supreme Court struck down the law that made them legal. Vote Ramos. During the primary, we swooned over Issaquah City Council Member Victoria Hunt for her enthusiastic support for rent stabilization and her urbanist know-how–she’s an experienced urban planner with a PhD in computational ecology. Now we swoon over her again, especially when we see that her Republican opponent is Mark Hargrove, who we once named the “dumbest legislator in Washington” for using a Jack in the Box commercial to buoy his argument against same-sex marriage. When it comes to housing, Hunt knows that changing zoning alone will not magically create the very large number of apartments that we need to build, which is why she supports funneling more money into the Housing Trust Fund, one of the funds the state uses to help subsidize affordable units. Unlike her opponent, she believes that we need to increase funding for education, especially for students in the special education system. And she wants to protect that funding by making sure that no dollars go toward charter school voucher programs. On climate, she strongly supports the state’s cap-and-trade system and wants to pass a bill to force fossil fuel companies to open their books so we can see just how much of a burden they’re passing down to consumers while raking in huge profits. But what we love the most about Hunt is her support for all kinds of progressive revenue ideas– everything from adjustments to the capital gains tax, an excess compensation tax, and even a tweak to make the estate tax more progressive. She’s in her Robin Hood era. Vote Hunt. Lawmakers work on a number of issues, but three-term State Representative Lisa Callan seems especially dedicated to helping Washington’s children, which is great–our understanding is that children are our future, and if we want to have a good future then we have to treat them well and not just throw them in the lake when they fuck up like our uncles did. Anyhow, Callan successfully carried the bill to increase the 2024 special education funding cap from 15 to 16 percent, which was a good start but probably isn’t enough. The bill included funding for a report that will tell us whether we should remove the cap altogether or whether, miraculously, every school’s needs somehow conform to this arbitrary cap, so we’re happy for that. Last year, Callan also permanently enshrined a program that keeps kids in foster care connected to their original homes. The Family Connections Program provides resources to parents and foster parents to allow them to work together on reunification, seeking to minimize the trauma of the child welfare system by helping to maintain some communication between all parties when possible. If reelected, Callan will keep pushing her colleagues to back her bill limiting isolation and restraint of children in schools, a disciplinary strategy that really isn’t that productive for a lot of seven-year-olds! In the meantime, she’s scraped together some dollars for some pilot programs encouraging districts to avoid the practice, and she’s running an inside strategy to get more lawmakers onboard with the movement to stop traumatizing kids. She beat her opponent, Patrick Peacock, by about 15 points in the primary, and it’s no wonder why. Like the rest of these cookie-cutter Republicans, he supports all the shitty initiatives, wants to lower taxes, and yet also wants more police. Classic. We’d do the state’s children a real disservice in swapping out Callan for a generic Republican. Vote Callan. When he’s not working on education policy, State Representative Steve Bergquist acts out his own version of Undercover Boss as a paraeducator and substitute teacher in Renton. The time in the classroom informs his work as a legislator, which has led to the introduction and passage of some pretty decent policies. Last session, he successfully secured money to standardize programming that helps kids transition to Kindergarten. He also voted to eliminate the special education enrollment cap that many legislators (at least 94 of them in the House) believe interferes with the State’s duty to provide a free, appropriate education to all students. Though his bill to fund one year of trade school for free didn’t make it out of committee last session, he'll try again next year if he wins back his seat–which he should. Bergquist’s Libertarian opponent, Justin Greywolf, is mostly running on a platform of cutting taxes. He also told the Family Policy Institute of Washington–a conservative, religious lobbying organization that defends “Biblical values”—that he agreed with a lot of their positions, though he said he disagreed with their opposition to marriage equality. That’s not quite enough to swing us to his side. Vote Bergquist. Last year, State House Representative Jamila Taylor got ahold of $1.25 million to stop Pattison’s West Skating Center (now known as El Centro Skate Rink) in Federal Way from turning into a gas station, an accomplishment that immediately elevated her in our eyes to the status of a 1980s movie hero. We love a legislator who cares that deeply about a culturally significant gathering place in her community. We also appreciate the economic development work she’s done for her district and across Washington, including her Covenant Homeownership Program, which provides interest-free loans to first-time homebuyers who can prove they or their family felt the effect of Washington’s racial housing discrimination prior to 1968. The program also includes a provision to investigate past housing discrimination to see if lawmakers can expand eligibility criteria, and it will hopefully go a little way toward repairing discrimination that led to wealth gaps. If we return her to office for a third term, as chair of the House Civil Rights & Judiciary Committee she promises to continue making progress on creating a unified court system. The Legislature needs to modernize and standardize our court system, partly so we can collect better information on its effects. We’re glad Taylor’s on the case because she really lights up when she talks about this very serious but utterly dull work. Her Republican opponent, Republican Melissa Hamilton, has worked for both the Lacey and Federal Way police departments in support roles. She supports all of the initiatives, which would set Washington back on climate change, long-term care, and progressive revenue. While Taylor’s down in Olympia digging into court structures and trying to reverse years of discrimination, Hamilton would be making it harder for the state to fund services and fighting any bills to limit police power or reduce mass incarceration. Boriiinnnggg. Vote Taylor. State House Representative Kristine Reeves is fine. If elected for a second full term, her one big priority will be to ban flavored tobacco products in Washington State. Whoopee. In the 2023 Healthy Youth Survey, about 7.7 percent of 10th graders reported using an electronic cigarette in the past 30 days. Vaping companies seem to target the youth with their bright colors and candy flavors, and Reeves doesn’t want her kids or anyone else’s to grow up in the shadow of addiction. Fair enough. Even if we’re a little sad that Reeves plans to confiscate our cinnamon-flavored vape fluid, it was nice that she sponsored the House version of the bill to establish a state-run, automatic Individual Retirement Account (IRA) program for workers whose employers don’t offer them. Though the senate version ultimately passed, the new law could result in Washingtonians saving an additional $3.9 billion for retirement over the next 20 years. That could be big. According to Legislative staff, about two-thirds of all millennials have no retirement savings. She also voted for rent stabilization, and she promises to keep voting for it, she says. She stressed that Washington can’t build its way out of the problem of housing instability tomorrow, and the bill addresses the immediate harm people face from rising rent prices pushing them out onto the street. Reeves did do a couple weird things surrounding that bill, though. First, she secured an amendment to monitor the effects of rent stabilization, with a particular focus on whether the program inadvertently dissuades people from pursuing home ownership, especially Black and Brown people, Reeves says. This argument made our heads explode. Washington has the sixth highest average rent in the country, nearly half of our renters currently spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and the median home price in King County topped $1 million this year. That’s what makes it difficult to buy a house–not protections to prevent gouging. But, whatever. The study is mostly harmless. Reeves argued she just wants to ensure the state funds rental protection programs alongside home ownership assistance options, which is fine. We do like her more than her opponent, Republican Federal Way School Board Director Quentin Morris. In an interview with the Federal Way Mirror, he argued that homelessness is “rarely a housing scarcity” issue and is simply based on “behavioral issues.” Reeves responded to that assertion by first exclaiming, “Jesus Christ,” and then she said she’s just tired of hearing Morris’s bullshit. Reeves herself experienced homelessness for a couple years as a teenager, and it had nothing to do with her having a substance use disorder or a mental health diagnosis. Vote Reeves. Look, we’re not saying that eight-term State House Representative Cindy Ryu won’t try to defend a landlord. She’s a commercial landlord herself, after all. But she voted for a rent stabilization bill that would help prevent landlords from gouging tenants, and that’s better than we would have predicted in 2022. She’s just okay on tenant issues, but we can work with just okay. We also didn’t love Ryu for sponsoring a bill to make trafficking in catalytic converters a Class C Felony, but we also don’t love waking up to a damaged car that’s going to release more gross emissions, so we’ll call that a wash. Plus, Ryu is occasionally a friend to some recently incarcerated people. She said she’s working with Edmonds Community College (ECC) on a bill to help fund support and courses for veterans who did time. ECC started a similar program using federal COVID-19 dollars a few years ago, and Ryu hopes to find state money to make the program permanent and maybe expand it to other community colleges. Though that bill failed to exit a key committee last session, she plans to bring it forward again next session. We’d happily take Ryu’s lukewarm support for rent stabilization (she said she'd be more comfortable with a 10 percent cap than the 7 percent cap she ultimately voted for) and her heavy regulation of the scrap metal industry over her opponent, Republican Lisa Rezac, an auctioneer, fundraising consultant, and former Republican Party Chair for the 32nd Legislative District. Rezac supports the Let’s Go Washington initiatives, which would reduce funding for public education and set the state back in its climate goals. AND YET, she claims she wants to prioritize education and to stop the government and corporations from putting anything into our air and water that might hurt us. We really don’t think she’s thought through her platform, though we did love that she dedicated one entire page of her website to promoting some random wellness book. But that's not enough to convince us. Vote Ryu. State House Representative Lauren Davis deserves a fourth term in the Legislature for her dedication to improving Washington’s underperforming behavioral health and criminal legal systems. Few lawmakers display her breadth of knowledge and commitment to making progress on any issue, let alone a couple of the toughest and most politically dicey ones we face. But she’s not one to let the cowardice of her colleagues prevent her from funding the issues she supports. Every session that leadership decides to skip an opportunity to pass a new progressive tax, she spends hours digging for ways to close loopholes to find the millions of dollars that the State could be collecting and redirecting toward treatment facilities, recovery housing, and jail reentry programs. Admittedly her hours of study haven't always paid off. In 2022, she tried to close a tax break for companies that warehouse opioids and other drugs in Washington. The bill would have raised an estimated $53 million to go to far better purposes, but it died at its first public hearing. She promises to bring it back again this session. The death of that bill does not speak to the level of success that Davis has achieved during her time in the House, though. Thanks to her, Washington hospitals send every overdose patient home with a naloxone kit, not just a prescription for one. (Under the previous system, few people actually filled those naloxone prescriptions.) She’s also had her hand in some criminal justice reform, eliminating a law that revoked a person’s license after any felony conviction involving the use of a car, unless the crime threatened the safety of people or property. The law scooped up a lot of people and made complying with sentencing conditions, such as making behavioral health appointments or retaining employment, much harder. On the other side, Davis’s Republican opponent, Lori Theis, plans to vote for Trump. Though she says she wants to “fix” homelessness, crime, and every other issue conservatives like to exploit for votes, she offers no real viable or evidence-backed alternatives. Vote Davis. Back in 2015, longtime State Representative Tina Orwall made it her mission to get the Washington State Crime Lab to finish testing all the backlogged sexual assault kits. Thanks partly to her consistent pressure, last year she saw the successful conclusion of that work, allowing us all to close that “dark chapter” in our state’s history, she says. Now, the lab tests kits within 45 days, and sometimes closer to a month, which provides people with more paths for legal action. While Orwall sometimes leans a little heavily into carceral feminism for some of our tastes, at other times she seriously pursues avenues other than policing to solve societal ills. For example, she led the House’s work on 988, a suicide and crisis hotline that allows people to call something other than 911 when they need help with a behavioral health crisis. She also sponsored a successful bill to fund more mobile crisis teams in conjunction with the launch of 988. At a time when people seem reluctant to take up police work and communities struggle to help people cycling through behavioral systems, investing in these alternatives seems wise. For her next project, she’s started coordinating with colleges to find better ways to help students access services after they’ve dealt with gender-based violence. Right now, victim complaints often only lead to a scheduled appointment with a counselor. She’s not yet sure what “better” looks like, but we’re excited to see what she comes up with. We don’t have very many mean things to say about her opponent, George Richter, mainly because he’s not giving us much to work with. He has no money, and we weren’t even really sure if he existed. But Orwall says she met him the other day, and they’re actually going to talk about some stuff they can work on together. We’d prefer she shun Republicans, especially in the age of Trump, but good for her for neutralizing her opponents. Vote Orwall. Generally, we have good things to say about State House Representative Mia Su-Ling Gregerson. For the past 10 years, she has consistently supported legislation to keep people in housing, to tax the rich, and to increase participation in the political process. Last session, she fought hard for a bill to allow cities to hold local elections on even years, when average voter turnout runs much higher. That simple change would make municipal elections much more democratic and representative, which we love–and not just because it scares politicians such as conservative Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson, who was elected in a low-turnout, odd-year election. Unfortunately, Gregerson failed to find the votes for the bill, but she promises to keep fighting if we give her a sixth term. While she’s good on tenant stuff and democracy stuff, her increased support for charter schools, which she recently confessed to the Seattle Times, deeply disappoints us. As if the education system didn’t have enough issues, now we have to deal with progressives peeling off to funnel dollars away from actual public schools. Gregerson told the Seattle Times she thought charter schools could offer benefits, such as smaller class sizes, and that it may be time for a conversation about increasing the number of schools. When we asked her what the fuck she was talking about, she said she wanted to remain open to the conversation because people continue to ask her about increasing funding for charter schools. She says she’s sat through presentations where BIPOC parents with kids attending South King County charter schools share how their students really thrive in those environments. She pushes back on the idea that charters improve outcomes for kids of color, arguing that many of those kids often live in Kirkland and Bellevue, and they benefit from a high economic status. She could also point to all the evidence showing that charter schools lack funding accountability and lead to underfunding of public schools. And while we readily admit that public schools are failing children of color, we disagree that she needs to leave the door open for a discussion about ways to starve public schools of the funding we need to better serve them. Nevertheless, Gregerson is a much better candidate than her opponent, Casey Esmond, who appears not to be running much of a campaign. His candidate website is no longer up, and he ignored our call, as well as calls from other, lesser, endorsement boards. From what we can tell, he espouses a Libertarian ideology. Very old school, very ‘90s. Still, we hope Gregerson will stand firm against charter schools. Vote Gregerson. When the SECB endorsed House Representative Emily Alvarado for her first term in 2022, we vowed to print out our endorsement and eat it if she ended up morphing into her old boss, Jenny Durkan. Good news: We don't have to do that! Double good news: We don't have to learn how to connect to the printer in the office! Alvarado exceeded our expectations during her first term in the House. She marketed herself as a strong housing advocate, and advocate she did, supporting, if we are not mistaken, every single bill to encourage housing density. She also championed the perennial rent stabilization bill, an issue so tough we thought she took it on as part of some kind of humiliation ritual to haze the frosh. But she passed it out of her chamber, moving the humiliation on to the moderates in the Senate who killed the bill. In addition to standing up to the landlord lobby, she stood up for the working class by making it easier to access food assistance programs, accelerating stability for those with work-limiting disabilities, and attempting to beef up consumer protections around gift cards. Alvarado said she wants another term to attend to some unfinished business. She'll pass rent stabilization through the House again, only this time with a more progressive Senate to get it to the Governor's desk. She'll also remove barriers to workers’ benefits that some see after a workplace injury, fight to keep kids who are in the foster care system out of the criminal legal system, and pass legislation to make it easier to get a year's supply of birth control all at once. Though she anticipates a tough budget year in 2025, she said Washington needs a strong advocate for progressive revenue like her. We agree! And we'll take nine of her for the Seattle City Council, please! Real Slog readers get it *wink*. With all Alvarado has going for her, it's almost not worth mentioning her Republican opponent, Kimberly Cloud. In fact, it would be almost kinder for us to pretend she does not exist. We like that Cloud frequently used “lol” in the answers to her Ballotpedia questionnaire, but we didn’t like that she said her biggest role model is Donald Trump, and that she recommended voters watch the 1994 buddy comedy Dumb and Dumber to understand her political philosophy. We’ll pass! Vote Alvarado. State House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon may not be the 23-year-old lefty the SECB of yesteryear fell for (and heavily sexualized! Sorry about that, Joe. It won’t happen again—at least not until you go gray). But with landmark climate policy on the ballot, we need an environmental advocate like Fitzgibbon wrangling Democrats in the House to do the right thing. As we’ve mentioned, this year mega-rich farmer-cosplayer Brian Heywood bought a slew of “Let’s Go Washington”-branded initiatives, including I-2066 to ban electrification and I-2117 to repeal the Climate Commitment Act. Fitzgibbon said the passage of either initiative would represent a huge step backward, but if that happens, then he would use his leverage in leadership to strengthen the environmental policies the state will still have. For example, he suggested accelerating timelines for the Clean Fuel Standard law, which requires fuel suppliers to reduce carbon intensity of transportation fuels to 20 percent below 2017 levels by 2034. He also said he could expand the Clean Buildings Performance Standards to include more types of buildings, or ramp up requirements on car dealers in the Zero-Emission Vehicles law. But right now, Fitzgibbon is putting all his energy into stopping the repeal altogether. We think it's pretty cool that he fights the good fight off the clock, too! On the other hand, his opponent, Jolie Ann Lansdowne, shouts out her support for the “Let’s Go Washington” initiatives on the homepage of her website. In addition to the attacks on environmental policy, she seems particularly excited to repeal the capital gains tax, a modest 7 percent tax on the sale of stocks, bonds, and other long-term capital assets. In contrast, Fitzgibbon said he will be an advocate for progressive revenue. Instead of repealing the capital gains tax, he’s interested in filling some of its “loopholes,” particularly the exclusion of residential real estate. Based. Vote Fitzgibbon. State House Rep. Liz Berry won 89 percent of the vote in the primary, and we totally get it. She advocates for popular, Democratic priorities, and she does so very successfully. Hate gun violence? Berry’s right there with ya. She introduced and passed a ban on ghost guns, a mandatory 10-day waiting period on the purchase of firearms, and a bill to require gun owners to report their missing or stolen guns within 24 hours. She also co-sponsored a ban on the sale of assault rifles and a ban on high-capacity magazines. Now, if only she’d sponsor a bill to melt all the guns… Anyway, love workers’ rights? So does Berry. She shepherded bills to help workers recover wages they’re owed, to extend death benefits to the families of gig drivers who die on the job, and to invalidate non-disclosure agreements for workers who experience harassment, discrimination, assault, retaliation, and wage theft in the workplace. As chair of the House Labor Committee, she also worked on and supported the Strippers Bill of Rights and a bill protecting workers who refuse to attend captive audience meetings We’re not sure when Berry sleeps, but we’re glad she’s not tired of her job just yet. In her next term, she will continue her gun safety crusade by reintroducing a bill to establish a permit-to-purchase system. She believes such a system will help prevent guns from getting into “the wrong hands.” She also wants to push legislation to require companies to label their recyclable materials in a way that makes sorting waste easier on the consumer. We would advise you not to vote for her opponent, Victoria Palmer, a Republican who advocates for “vaccine choice,” but, again, almost 90% of voters in Berry’s district already voted for her, so we’re preaching to the choir. Vote Berry. BREAKING: The Stranger Election Control Board endorses a tech bro landlord–AGAIN. But we’re not endorsing just any tech bro landlord, we’re endorsing State House Rep. Chipalo Street. Hear us out. Despite what his background might suggest, Street is without question one of the most progressive lawmakers in the whole State Legislature. He spent his first term securing incentives for the development of affordable housing and supporting vital health care infrastructure. Street argues that his experiences in some of the more bloodless corners of the private market contribute to his good work in the public sector. His Big Tech job gave him a unique and important perspective on the My Health My Data Act, a first-of-its-kind bill he co-sponsored that requires companies to take meaningful steps to protect consumer health data. He could sniff out when lawmakers should hear the tech sector as whiny babies and when they actually had a good point, particularly when it came to implementation timelines. Similarly, Street used his experience as a landlord to act as an authoritative counter to the landlord lobby’s advocacy against rent stabilization. When landlords gasped at a 7 percent cap on rent increases, Street pointed out that a landlord’s mortgage is fixed. That 7 percent cap is plenty to cover the increased cost of utilities and maintenance expenses. Finally, if we give Street another two years, he swears to be another dedicated foot soldier in the quest for more progressive revenue. The state will likely face a deficit next year, and the candidates we elect will decide between slashing social programs and taxing the rich. Street would choose to tax the rich. Right answer! Vote Street. When not caping for corporate interests, state Senator Lisa Wellman, who represents Mercer Island, tends to vote the right way, and she seems broadly supportive of things we like, such as progressive taxation, opposition to charter schools, and, somewhat excitingly, rent stabilization–though she has some caveats there about wanting cities to set the caps themselves, to which we say booooooo, and booo again. Given that she chairs the Early Learning & K-12 Education Committee and sits on the Senate’s powerful Ways & Means Committee at a moment when schools across the state face big deficits, education will top her list of priorities this session. In our interview, she swore that in her fifth term she’d push for a fully funded public education system. In fact, she says she’s already starting to “oil the skids” on that topic with her fellow legislators and has put together presentations on why administration and operation costs continue to climb for school districts. If she can explain where every district spends its dollars to the satisfaction of her fellow lawmakers, she hopes they’ll be more inclined to increase funding. She also wants to push Congressman Adam Smith to make the federal government kick in more for special education funding. Finally, she’s hoping to work with her Olympia “bestie,” potential future Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer, to figure out how to lower insurance costs for schools. Our major gripe with Wellman is her consistent opposition to removing the cap on the percentage of students enrolled in special education. In 2023, Wellman agreed to lift the cap from 13.5 to 15 percent, but she opposed full elimination of the cap, a decision that frustrated some lawmakers, including State House Representative Gerry Pollet, who wanted to see the cap gone altogether. (That cap increased to 16 percent in 2024.) Pollet has consistently framed the "arbitrary cap” as a civil rights issue that disproportionately hurts low-income and students of color. We’re with him on this one and think the state can’t just set a random number for what they think a school’s disability percentage should be. Luckily, the State Auditor plans to study this very issue and give the Legislature a recommendation by the end of 2025. Hopefully Pollet can shake some dollars loose from Wellman in the meantime. Still, Wellman’s clearly working to convince the Legislature that school districts aren’t fretting away their funding on unnecessary expenses, as some would believe. And she’s a hell of a lot better than Republican Jaskaran Singh Sarao, the Bellevue landlord who jumped on the right’s weird “squatter” panic and harassed his tenant for months. Vote Wellman. Yet again, State House Representative Tana Senn managed to exceed our expectations for someone from Mercer Island. With her bill to allow the Washington State Patrol to melt down the guns they confiscate, she ended the state’s role as a gun dealer, which was kinda fun. She also sided with tenants on the issue of rent stabilization, supporting a 7 percent cap on rent increases. And her bill to fund electric school buses shows us she cares about clean air around bus stops and the planet that our kids will inherit. She’s also advocated for some necessary but arguably controversial bills, as well. Last session, she sponsored a bill to help children convicted of a sex offense to seek removal from the sex offender registry based on completion of certain court conditions. We appreciate someone who stands up for the future of all children, not just the ones choking on smog at bus stops. That kind of courage deserves a seventh term. And she certainly outshines her Republican challenger, Emily Tadlock, who spent part of 2022 prowling through neighborhoods trying to unearth illegal voters. We imagine Tadlock may end up having some controversial takes about this presidential election. How enthralling. Vote Senn. We thought about making this endorsement a TikTok montage of us and State House Representative My-Linh Thai set to Billie Eilish’s “Birds of a Feather,” but our Human Resources department advised us against that. Buzzkills! Anyway, Rep. Thai is an exceptional advocate for working-class people in a Legislature that’s way too cozy with the landlord lobby. In her last term, she fought for renters by scoring more money in the state budget to pay for legal aid for tenants facing eviction and by passing a new law to protect tenants from unreasonable damage claims. While she’ll always support renters’ rights, she’s got a different priority for her next term: The wealth tax. In 2023, Thai and another SECB fav, state Sen. Noel Frame, proposed the Washington State Wealth Tax, a super-narrow tax on extreme wealth over a quarter million dollars of assessed value derived from the ownership of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. The revenue would pay for education, housing, disability services, and tax credits for working families. The proposal didn’t make it very far in either chamber, but Thai thinks she and Frame can build a pressure campaign to move stragglers within her party—after all, Democrats have a majority, which should grow after this election. If Thai doesn’t win, we’d lose one of our strongest advocates for progressive revenue to Republican Al Rosenthal, who advocates against the sales tax, car tab fees, and other regressive revenue streams without plans to backfill them with a tax on the rich. But taxation is far from the centerpiece of his campaign. Rosenthal joins a distressing trend of candidates who seemed to plug the sparknotes of that San Fransicko book into ChatGPT to write their ill-conceived “Treatment First” homelessness platforms. We’ve debunked this model a few times in response to We Heart Seattle’s Andrea Suarez and new internet villain Rachael Savage. And no amount of cosplaying as war reporters on 3rd and Pine will change the fact that it is more effective to house people than to stick them into mandatory treatment, where they may fail out and return to the streets. This ideology of shame, punishment, and paternalism must be rejected. In the meantime, vote Thai. We could all go on and on and on about how Statewide Poverty Action Network Lobbyist Shaun Scott and We Heart Seattle Executive Director Andrea Suarez represent starkly different ideologies and visions for Washington, but voters in one of the state’s most renter-heavy districts are too busy working too hard for too little to put up with that crap. The choice here is between a candidate who knows what they’re talking about and one who does not. Even if he talks as if he expected us to carve his words into stone atop Mount Sinai, Scott isn’t your typical sanctimonious Democratic Socialist. (Sorry, love you all.) He’s a serious guy with serious policy experience who wants to get stuff done in Olympia–like yesterday. He’s all-in on closing corporate tax loopholes, implementing progressive taxes like a statewide wealth tax, and taxing real estate transactions to pay for social housing. To help out all those tenants in the district, he wants rent control, and he wants rent payments to help build credit scores. As a representative of a neighborhood the cops gassed for a week, he also wants to protect protestors from state prosecution, establish a state police accountability board, and pass a law to stop police unions from bargaining away accountability measures. And as many Democrats ignore COVID entirely, Scott wants to fund research for Long COVID and to support those suffering from the post-viral illness. Sprinkle a state task force to look into white supremacist activity and resettlement centers for asylum-seekers, and, people, you have like a third of his detailed platform. Suarez lacks this sort of vision and eye for policy. Though her campaign materials tout her as a “progressive,” it’s all drag. Zero Democratic groups back her, let alone the progressive ones–and for good reason. Based on the way she’s been running her campaign, she’s got more in common with a compulsive conservative Facebook commenter than she does with even the most moderate of Democrats. When not calling Scott a “communist,” she spends her time proselytizing on behalf of a homelessness policy that spawned from a toxic MAGA pit and tagging news organizations on social media when she finds stuff in the woods. That’s about it. Though the big brains on the Seattle Times Editorial Board dismiss Scott as an extremist, they don’t have much company. Scott has been endorsed by more than a dozen labor unions, the biggest conservation group in the state, environmental justice orgs, urbanist orgs, and gobs of establishment Democrats, including his potential future seatmate, State House Rep. Nicole Macri, and Washington State House Speaker Emeritus Rep. Frank Chopp. If you want someone who will actually provoke debate in Olympia and not waste any more of your precious time, then vote Scott. The Stranger Election Control Board probably would have bought a billboard to attract new talent to the 45th Legislative District, which covers Kirkland, if 20-year incumbent State House Rep. Larry Springer faced another election without a progressive challenger. That’s why it is with such great pleasure that we endorse labor organizer Melissa Demyan to knock down this switch-hitter Democrat. Things we like about Demyan: She’s a renter, she’s got a union background, she wore a cool tie to our endorsement meeting, and she’s not fucking Springer. He’s a landlord (to his adult son, if that matters), he’s the self-described liaison between his caucus and the business community (there’s plenty others, believe us), and he wore no such cool tie to our meeting. (Though we did like his glasses, and he kinda had great taste in general.) Instead, Springer droned on and on, excusing his piss-poor voting record on technicalities or utter bullshit. Why didn’t he support a bill to protect abortion care from hospital mergers? He wanted to consider how the bill would affect chiropractors. Why did he want to give more public funding to charter schools? He said he liked the educational “vibe” in charter school classrooms. Why does he support I-2066, the Republican-backed initiative to ban electrification? Based on the convoluted answer he gave and then somewhat walked back in a follow-up email, we have to assume he just did not read the initiative. Still, Springer thinks his experience as one of the few lawmakers who served during the 2008 financial crisis would be valuable next year as the State faces budget turmoil. We say institutional knowledge, shminstitutional shknowledge. If Springer’s still convinced we should use public funds on charter schools after two decades in the State Legislature, we actually don’t think he’s better-suited to manage tax dollars than any rando in Kirkland. And Demyan’s not a rando. Sure, she may be a little green, but she’s got all the organizing experience a lawmaker needs to build coalitions to pass bills that will help people. Give her even half a term in Olympia, and she’ll find all the levers she needs to pull. Springer had his chance. It’s time to pass the torch. Vote Demyan. As Seattle’s school district threatens to shutter elementary schools, voters in the 46th Legislative District, which covers the city’s northeastern reaches, should count themselves lucky to have a public education champion like State House Rep. Gerry Pollet on the ballot this year. In his last term, he raised the “unconscionable and unconstitutional” cap on education services funding for children with disabilities. He promises to eliminate the cap for good in his next term. To stave off school closures, he will propose a $1.1 billion increase to school budgets. He acknowledges that the sum won’t solve the problem entirely, as school funding relies heavily on local levy revenue. To help juice enrollment to keep those state dollars flowing, he said Seattle must increase affordable, family-sized housing density around public schools. And he’s not just saying that to the Stranger Election Control Board. In a six-page letter, he told Mayor Bruce Harrell that his comprehensive plan did not go far enough to promote affordable density. That brings us to the elephant in the room—Pollet’s NIMBY streak. He watered down the so-called “missing middle” housing bill, catching a lot of flack from urbanist types. He stands by it, saying he wanted to keep marginalized communities in their neighborhoods. To be clear, we think he should still advocate against displacement, but we hope he finds ways to do that without perpetuating the housing shortage that also prices people out of their neighborhoods. But we probably won’t have to worry about a repeat of the “missing middle” episode because Democrats booted him from the local government committee. And it's not like his opponent brings a platform of militant urbanism to the ballot. Republican Beth Daranciang’s “platform” matches the policy prescriptions offered by every other low-rent GOP loser on this ballot: She supports all four batshit initiatives, wants to cut taxes, fearmongers about crime, and then caps it all off with a little transphobic nonsense about “women’s and girls’ sex-based rights.” Vote Pollet. In 2022, Washington voters sent Rep. Darya Farivar–the State House’s youngest member, its first Middle Eastern woman, and its first Iranian American–off to Olympia. And they were so right to do so. Whether she’s crafting or voting on legislation, she approaches questions of policy with an exacting mind and human heart. A wonk who previously directed public policy for Disability Rights Washington, she recognizes how small tweaks and vague legal language can make an enormous difference in our lives. Farivar successfully carried bills last session that eliminated the cost of extended family visits to their incarcerated loved ones, made sure people leaving state custody had an ID in their hands when they headed home (you can’t really get a job or apartment without one), raised caps on penalties for antitrust violations to hold big companies to account for things like price-fixing and collusion. She also sponsored the Nothing About Us Without Us Act, which requires the state to include people with lived experience of issues in government work groups, task forces, and advisory committees. In Farivar’s experience, that kind of requirement leads to better policy. All-in-all, that’s four bills she prime-sponsored and got passed, as well as another she co-sponsored–quite good for a junior lawmaker. And if we send her back, which we should, then she’ll keep doing more good work. Next session, for instance, she plans to reintroduce a bill that would give courts the option to divert low-level offenders with mental health and substance use disorders to treatment alternatives, skipping jail that can disrupt housing and job prospects and even lead to overdoses. We’ll happily take a compassionate policy nerd like Farivar over a vibes candidate like her Republican challenger, Simone Barron. At first blush, you’d think a service industry pro with 35 years experience who co-founded the Full Service Workers Alliance and sat on the board of Restaurant Workers of America would be into worker’s rights, but names can deceive. In 2021, she did a video for the conservative media nonprofit PragerU, which tries to brainwash America’s children (and adults) with their trash content, to explain how minimum wage increases are an attack on tipped workers. We don’t think they are, and we’re not alone. Barron has attracted only tens of financial backers, and nearly a quarter of her whopping $4,100 war chest comes straight from the King County Republican Party. Lol. Vote Farivar. Debra Jean Entenman is the friend we generally get along with, occasionally really vibe with, and have that one awkward topic we don’t want to bring up, but we respect her sense of conviction overall. A 30-year resident of Kent who first ran to represent a changing South King County, Entenman has represented the 47th Legislative District since kicking Republican dunce cap Mark Hargrove to the curb in 2018. We want her to stay. On the transportation committee, she says she’s worked to improve the safety between SR 18 and I-90. Covington locals benefit from her commitment to creating more parks and improving the pool, so more kids of color can learn to swim, hopefully preventing drownings in our watery region. We all benefit from her uncompromising attitude on police accountability. In 2021, she sponsored a bill to create Washington’s Office of Independent Investigations, which will start investigating incidents of deadly police force this December. She wants to go even farther by eliminating police immunity and creating a statewide prosecutor independent of the State Attorney General. That latter goal gets tricky because it would take a state constitutional amendment, so Entenman supported State House Rep. Monica Stonier’s Russia- doll workaround to create an independent office within the AG’s office. That bill failed, and she says the community did not think the office would be separated enough anyway because prosecutors still had first dibs on cases. But she remains open to other ideas, and we appreciate the effort. Our beef with Entemann was and will continue to be the charter schools she’s insistent on funding. When we asked about charters siphoning off funds from kids in neighborhood schools across the country, she said without charters there is still inequality from rich fundraising PTA parents at well-to-do public schools. Yeah okay fine, but two wrongs don’t make a right. But since her now-perennial Republican challenger, Kyle Lyebyedyev, is not so much a real candidate as much as he is a scramble of promises to fix everything without raising taxes, we’ll just have to agree to disagree with her. This is sort of beside the point, but Lyebyebyev looks like Zach Braff and Dax Shepard morphed into one guy. Coincidentally, he’s also really annoying. For some reason, he calls his public Facebook page “Kyle Lyebyedyev’s Corner: Where Family, Politics and Fun Collide,” our “gateway to connection, insight and a sprinkle of laughter.” The page features smiley family pics and a photo of him and his wife standing by an American flag with swimmer-turned-anti-trans activist Riley Gaines. At least Entenman’s not for charter school vouchers? Vote Entenman. State House Rep. Chris Stearns made history when his constituents voted him the first Native American on the Auburn City Council, and then again in 2022 when he became one of only three Indigenous lawmakers in the Legislature. And it’s not empty representation—he is using his seat to fight for Indigenous people. To name one example, he sponsored the Native American apprenticeship bill, which will help pay for tuition, supplies, and the cost of living for tribal members in apprenticeship programs when it goes into effect in 2026. He also doubled state funding to treat people living with a gambling disorder. Studies show Indigenous people deal with gambling addiction at about twice the rate of the general public. If we give him another term, Stearns says he will continue working to address problem gambling. Last year, he introduced a bill to create a pilot program for gambling treatment diversion court, which would help people who commit financial crimes as a result of their gambling addiction get into treatment instead of jail. Speaking of jail, the Legislature recently passed a bill to end the automatic use of juvenile points in sentencing that can add years to jail time. If we re-elect Stearns, he will push the issue even further and strike the juvenile points retroactively, removing years off of sentences that already accounted for juvenile points. It is clear to the SECB that Stearns brings a unique and thoughtful perspective to his role, which is more than we can say of his opponent, Ted Cooke. Cooke is a Republican–and an uncreative one at that. He’s running on a copy-paste platform of election denialism, bootlicking, and anti-trans panic, according to his website. Yawn! Vote Stearns. Vandana Slatter, chair of the Post-Secondary Education & Workforce Committee and co-chair of the Science, Technology and Innovation Caucus, is a clinical pharmacist running for her fourth full term in the State Legislature. We should send her back to continue fighting for the environment, affordable housing, access to a college education, and our all-important health care. Last year, Rep. Slatter worked with Gov. Jay Inslee’s office to create the Washington Climate Corps Network. Managed and administered by Serve Washigton, the program buoys AmeriCorps funds with Climate Commitment Act money to funnel 17 to 31-year-olds and military veterans toward green energy jobs statewide. Neat! She also co-sponsored a bill that streamlines the financial aid process for high school students on food stamps. Starting next year, they’ll automatically qualify for the Washington College Grant without having to submit paperwork to prove their income. To ease the crushing burden of student debt on the state’s public servants and to align with changes to the federal Public Loan Service Program, she also introduced a bill to better notify teachers, firefighters, and nurses of relief opportunities. And last year, Inslee also Slatter’s My Health My Data Act, which protects our health information, as well as people visiting on their abortion care and gender-affirming medicine journeys from Republican hell states. All very good things! We can’t really drum up the same level of enthusiasm for her opponent, Lynn Trinh. Trinh’s short but sweet video-forward platform could be summed up with five hearty puffs on a bright-red dog whistle. Republicans, get your slop: “Reclaim Parental Rights, Restore Quality Education, Redeem Public Safety, Reduce Regulations and Taxes, and Return to Civil Liberties.” Love the alliteration, but hate the ideas. Trinh, whose family moved to the US following China’s Cultural Revolution, said she “understood the danger of losing freedoms” but has suggested that “Tibet’s today” could be America’s tomorrow, and this “misinformation” talk is silencing “genuine criticism.” Counterpoint: No, and if you’re worried about draconian overreach, then maybe the call is coming from inside the house? Anyway, she didn’t respond to our meeting invitation, and it’s not entirely clear how Trinh hopes to protect your constitutional rights, but it will involve school choice and “giving power to the people” by giving cops more power, and also solving homelessness with “community-driven” responses. Bleh. Vote Slatter. We remain big fans of Sal Mungia, who plans to ensure greater access to the legal system and to guarantee that people face a fair and impartial court no matter their race. His passion for his work as well as for civil rights gives us confidence that, if elected, he’ll likely succeed at improving the court system for all. Mungia consistently landed on the right side of history as an attorney. He’s spent most of his career as a personal injury lawyer for Gordon Thomas Honeywell in Tacoma, and while he focused on medical malpractice lawsuits, he’s fought for all kinds of causes. Back in 2005, he was filing amicus briefs in support of same-sex marriage in Washington. Before that, he fought and won better conditions for people held at Pierce County Jail. Mungia passionately voices his support for the legal reasoning behind “the bright-line Rhone rule,” a Washington Courts policy that allows judges to take direct action against attorneys who try to eliminate jurors based on their race. He can rattle off statistics about the many ways the courts show bias against Black plaintiffs in the civil legal system. His close attention to these issues suggests that he’ll closely examine cases before him involving bias while also looking to make the court more equitable. Speaking of equity, we squeezed Mungia as hard as we could on the topic of whether he’d do the fair thing and overturn the dumb 1933 court decision that outlaws a progressive income tax in Washington. He knew better than to answer that question, as court cases must be decided based on the facts before the judges and all that jazz. Weirdly, his opponent, Federal Way Municipal Court Judge Dave Larson, shared his thoughts without much prodding, and he acknowledged if he’d had the capital gains tax in front of him as a Supreme Court Justice, he’d have ruled it a property tax lickity split. Despite finding Larson generally good company, his easy declaration that he’d opposed a progressive tax made it very simple to choose Mungia over him. Also, Larson’s choice to campaign alongside GOP gubernatorial candidate Dave Reichert certainly didn’t earn him any points in the room. When Larson attended an event with Reichert back in June, he told the crowd, “‘It’s time that we take back the judiciary in Washington state,’” according to the Chronicle. He argued that he only meant that people needed to have more control over the court so that it better served them, but, with all due respect, we think he’s full of shit. And anyway, we’re definitely gonna go ahead and back the candidate who defended gay marriage before it was cool over the candidate who speaks alongside a man who believes marriage should be “between a man and a woman.” Vote Mungia. King County Superior Court Judge Paul Crisalli says he works to pay attention to what happens to Black people and people of color who police sweep into the criminal system, he understands the importance of the Rhone Rule (or GR 37), which allows judges to take a more active role in preventing racist jury selection, and he believes in the importance of a public defender system. All told, he seems like a judge who has his heart in the right place. He’s big on jury selection. He’s embraced doing voir dire virtually, which we think is pretty cool since it allows more people to show up for the selection process, hopefully resulting in more diverse juries. He also advocates for increasing jury pay from the measly $10 a day that King County Superior Court currently funds. (That’s honestly crazy, juries should unionize.) Crisalli deeply understands the critical role that money plays in both the criminal and civil legal systems. He says he wished he could spell away the costs of the court system, but the best he can do for now is try to allow for more virtual hearings when possible, avoid holding superfluous hearings, and keep things moving in his courtroom by reading all the material that he needs to beforehand and coming prepared to court. Speaking of reading everything, if you’re an attorney reading this right now and you think you can just ChatGPT up your next brief for Crisalli, think again. He caught an attorney doing that the other day when he read a brief they submitted and realized none of the citations matched actual case law. Crisalli wouldn’t give us any of the other details (we thought the courts were open and public, apparently not.) Still, he says he’s interested in how AI may end up creeping into the court system, and we like a judge who is aware that people can start faking photos and videos to try to pin crimes on them. At the end of the day, Crisalli’s role is to referee a rigged system. We think he’ll do that as fairly as he can, and for that we say vote for him, especially over Andrew Schach, who works for the Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings. Schach acted like he couldn’t meet us for an endorsement interview or even speak with us during business hours. Literally, we’ve interviewed dozens and dozens of judges as part of SECB and never had this issue. He was also kind of rude. Much ruder for sure than Crisalli, who showed up bearing chocolate chip cookies he’d baked himself. What a sweetie. Vote Crisalli. It's like the old meme goes: If Alexis Mercedes Rinck has a million endorsements, the SECB is one of them. If Rinck has one endorsement, it’s the SECB. If Rinck has no endorsements, the SECB is dead. Aside from your NOs on those four ballot initiatives, the race for this citywide city council seat may be the most consequential bubble on your ballot. In 2023, in a low-turnout election, big business spent more than $1 million to flip the council from tepidly progressive to brazenly conservative. Since then, the new council has levied attacks on workers rights in the very region that put the Fight for $15 on the map. They’ve killed measures to incentivize affordable density amid a housing crisis. They’ve reinstated racist, transphobic, and classist anti-loitering laws that the City already repealed in 2020. They’ve so far refused to tax big business, putting affordable housing, renters’ services, and labor law enforcement on the chopping block in the 2025 budget. And they won’t stop there. All that bad shit we rattled off just now? Rinck’s against it. Rinck won’t fight for your bosses to pay you less, or for your landlords to evict you more easily, or for cops to arrest you more, or for corporations to hoard more wealth. We speak in negatives for a reason. Rinck won’t have many faithful friends on the council to help her advance policy. That’s not to say we doubt her political savvy—if anyone could reason with the current council to move forward on decent legislation, particularly in the realms of homelessness policy and public safety, it would be Rinck, who convinced a bunch of suburbs to buy into the regional response to homelessness during her time at the King County Regional Homelessness Authority. Still, the numbers are not in her favor, so we expect her to play defense for the oppressed in a legislative body that mostly seeks to comfort the oppressor. Speaking of comforting the oppressor, Rinck faces off against the council’s nepo baby, Tanya Woo, who lost her election in 2023 but got handed an appointment to the citywide seat at the request of the council’s corporate donors. And we’re not exaggerating here. In a letter to all those donors, PAC wrangler and consultant Tim Ceis said big business had “earned the right” to tell the council who to pick because they paid for their seats, and their puppet council did as instructed. And who is Woo, the person they picked? She’s the scion of landlords in the Chinatown International District whose political profile rose after she worked with Republicans to block a shelter expansion in SODO. One of the dimmer bulbs in the council’s already flickering chandelier, she evinces zero capacity for discussing complex legislation, no will to put forth any major legislation of her own, and otherwise displays total fealty to the corporate class. None of which should surprise anyone, given the fact that she’s only voted in local elections a handful of times in her life. Making sure you vote for Rinck is so important because her election represents something bigger than one seat; it represents a referendum on the entire conservative bloc. If Rinck blows Woo out of the water, this conservative council’s legitimacy may as well be toast. Any time they try to mess with working people or make the city more hostile to the unhoused, Rinck can vote against it with the backing of more voters than anyone else on the body. The bigger the win, the more momentum progressives can ride into the 2025 election, when the conservative ringleader, Council President Sara Nelson, will have to defend her seat. Let’s make her scared. Vote Rinck. If you ever leave your place of residence, you should absolutely vote “yes” on Prop 1 to pass our desperately needed transportation levy. The new levy will generate a historic $1.55 billion in its eight-year lifetime. The City will spend that money on 350 blocks of new sidewalks, 160 projects to improve bus-rider experience, safety projects at 70 high-collision locations, a full revamp of Aurora Avenue N, plus much, much, more. A little history: Mayor Bruce Harrell proposed a puny, baby little levy that favored car-centric infrastructure. Thanks to the tireless work of transportation, environmental, disability, labor, and other advocates, the mayor and then the transportation chair cranked that number up by $250 million and earmarked 45 percent of the total investment for multimodal transportation via buses, bikes, foot, and any other way you may get around without a car. The levy’s been called a “consensus” levy, as it pleases the progressive transit heads and the conservative business community. Even the Stranger Election Control Board struggled to play devil’s advocate against it. Every argument against Prop 1 falls apart like much of Seattle’s poorly maintained infrastructure would if this levy were to fail. Some may argue that the levy costs homeowners too much. For the owner of the median-valued home, the new levy will cost them $41 per month, a 70 percent increase from the $24 cost of the 2015 Levy To Move Seattle. Washington State relies heavily on property taxes to pay for social goods because our state constitution outlaws an income tax. The SECB would sacrifice a lifetime of drunk cigarettes if it meant flipping our upside-down taxation scheme right-side up, but, in the meantime, this is how we pay for shit. Besides, that framing's whack. Sure, $41 a month may sound like a lot, but relying on a car costs homeowners about $1,000 a month based on estimates from Experian, AAA, GasBuddy, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. The better our public transit, the less Seattleites have to rely on cars, the more money voters actually stand to save. Besides, the City and County run levy relief programs for seniors and disabled people who cannot shoulder the cost, so no one should be splitting pills for better bus service. On the flip side, there’s some militant urbanists who would rather tank this levy and force the City to produce a bigger, bolder one in 2025. If the levy legit sucked, then we’d be on board. But it doesn’t suck. And without a strong, concerted movement to reject it in protest, there’s no reason to believe the mayor and the city council would interpret a failed levy as anything but a sign to slash the price on a future proposal. Don’t overthink it. Vote yes on Prop 1.

Title: This Dividend His Climbed 590% Riding A ‘Quiet’ Megatrend

Scanning barcode on delivery parcel. I know it goes without saying that we’ve all loved watching our dividend stocks skyrocket this year. But October—as always, it seems—has amped-up the volatility. The end of the year looks choppy, with a widening war in the Middle East and a contentious (to say the least!) election on tap here at home. That makes now the time to sell any flawed dividends you may hold “on the rip.” We’ll break down one of these losers below. It’s the kind of stock that’s gone nowhere for so long that you may even have forgotten you own it! But we’re not just going into a defensive crouch here, because despite the market run-up, there are still some cheap dividend growers on the board. The sweet “pick-and-shovel” play we’ll talk about a little further on, which has spiked its payout an incredible 590% in the last decade, is a prime example. It’s unloved now, but it’s in the driver’s seat as central banks in China and the US turn dovish. Let’s get started by dumping that first stock I mentioned, then rolling our cash into that sweet, growing “stimulus-powered” divvie. Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) yields 3.5% as I write this, which is okay—it’s almost triple the sad 1.2% yield on the typical S&P 500 stock. But I worry its business model is obsolete in a world where e-commerce continues to surge: The company runs department stores—93 Nordstrom outlets and 269 Nordstrom Rack discount stores, as of the end of the second quarter. The other worry with Nordstrom: Debt. It’s carrying $2.6 billion in long-term debt, and even though it’s been paying that down, its current obligations are a high 72% of its market cap, or value as a public company. That weighs on Nordstrom’s ability to respond to rising competition from e-retailers and more specialized stores. It also cuts the odds of a hike to the dividend, which was suspended in 2020 and reinstated in 2022, though at just over half the previous rate. Worse, JWN devoted 91% of its free cash flow to dividends in the last 12 months, which is just not sustainable in the long run. Despite all this, the company is charging ahead with expansion. By the fall of 2025, it plans to open 32 new outlets (11 of which are already open). That’s a risk in the highly competitive retail market, and bear in mind that this company doesn’t have the best record of expansion. Witness its ill-fated move into Canada, which started with its first store, in Calgary, in 2014, and ended when it shuttered its last Canadian outlet in 2023. Thanks to the broader market rally, investors have bid JWN up about 18.5% year to date, to around $22. That’s way off the $82 highs it last saw 10 (!) years ago, but it’s the best we can hope for now. Take advantage of the market bounce to unload this one. Another knock on Nordstrom is that it’s an also-ran in e-commerce, far behind the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Amazon.com (AMZN). And I know it seems like we’ve been talking about e-commerce growth forever now, but there’s a good reason why: It’s one of those quiet megatrends that’s continued to pop higher, year after year. According to eMarketer, e-commerce sales will pass $6 trillion globally this year, and leap t0 $7.96 trillion by 2027. China is the biggest e-commerce market, at nearly $2.2 trillion in online sales in 2023, according to Statista. The US is No. 2, at $981 billion. Our favorite way to play that growth isn’t by trying to cherry-pick which retailer will win at the online game. Instead, we’re going with a “pick-and-shovel” play that profits no matter what: FedEx Corp. (FDX). (“Pick and shovel” refers to the California gold rush, in which the real winners were the merchants who sold the miners the picks, shovels and other supplies they needed—not the gold-panners themselves.) I mention China and the US because I see big catalysts coming out of both that are great news for FedEx’s profits. On the US side, we’ve got the rising possibility of a “no-landing” setup, something we’ve been talking about here on Contrarian Outlook for the better part of six weeks (and most recently last Tuesday)—though it’s only recently caught the press’s attention. Here’s what I mean: Normally when the Federal Reserve hikes rates, it does so until it breaks something. That didn’t happen this time (with the exception of Silicon Valley Bank and a handful of other brittle lenders). Now the Fed is in cutting mode, and while inflation has fallen, it remains stubborn, as last week’s CPI report showed. Meantime, government spending is out of control, with expenditures outrunning the tax receipts by just under $2 trillion. And you and I both know that no matter who wins the election, that’s not likely to change. Where does that leave us? Well, an “extra” $2 trillion will do a lot to keep an economy rolling! Too bad it also makes it likelier that inflation returns. Not great, I know. But a continually growing economy is great for FedEx. And our Fed isn’t the only dovish central bank! A couple weeks back, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced a sweeping set of stimulus measures. The PBoC lowered interest rates (including mortgage rates) and announced “stock market support” plans to help companies buy back their own shares and to allow investors to borrow against their portfolios. In this setup, FedEx benefits. The stock dropped on weak first-quarter profits in September, giving us a nice buy window. As I write this, FDX has some 40% upside from here, just to catch up with its ever-rising dividend. FDX Dividend Magnet (If you’re a regular reader, you likely know about the Dividend Magnet—the tendency of stock prices to match dividend growth over time. This is why the current yield, or the yearly payout divided into the current share price, on your favorite stock never seems to change very much.) The payout only yields 2% today, but we can consider that a “starter” yield on a buy made now, especially when you bear in mind that FDX has hiked its dividend an incredible 590% in the last decade. Moreover, the divvie only accounted for 49% of the company’s free cash flow over the last 12 months, far less than Nordstrom’s worrying 91%. That shelters the payout from whatever might be coming, economy-wise, and sets the table for more growth, too. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Shares of Nvidia fell 5% as global chipmakers lost $420 billion in market cap on Tuesday. (Photo via ... [+] Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images). Key Takeaways Stocks fell on Tuesday led by a $420 billion drop in the global chip stocks. The S&P 500 fell by 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1%. Meantime the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%; however, small cap stocks eked out a small gain, rising just under 0.2%. The big story on Tuesday was a warning from chipmaker ASML of a slower than expected recovery in some areas of the chip sector. That stock dropped 16% while the sector fell 5% overall. Other notable chip stocks that saw sharp declines included Advanced Micro Devices, down 5%. Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices each fell 3.4%, and Nvidia dropped 5%. While chip makers fell, other stocks in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) ecosystem started garnering attention. Specifically, suppliers of nuclear energy rallied on the day. With substantial energy demands to power AI, companies are turning toward nuclear energy as a low-cost source. Google announced on Tuesday morning that they signed a deal with Kairos Power, a maker of small-scale nuclear reactors. While Kairos isn't publicly traded, other stocks in the sector also rallied, including Oklo Inc. and Centrus Energy. Some other stocks in the news today include Boeing. The company announced it will raise $10 billion by selling new shares of stock to plug an existing cash crunch. That stock is trading slightly lower in premarket. Meantime, Starbucks could percolate today following an upgrade from Morgan Stanley with a price target of $115. On Tuesday, Starbucks closed at $95.04. Speaking of Morgan Stanley, that company posted earnings this morning that beat across the board. Net new assets came in at $63.9 billion, suggesting the company is taking market share. In premarket trading, shares of Morgan Stanley are indicated higher by 3%. We've already heard from other banking stocks such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America. All three stocks were lower on Tuesday with net interest income being cited as a challenge for those three companies. There aren't a lot of household name companies reporting earnings today; however, after the close tomorrow, we'll hear from Netflix. I'll be listening for two things on their conference call. First, does the company plan to raise prices. There are several analysts calling for that. Second, does the company have any further plans to move into live sports programming. Next month the company will host the Mike Tyson fight and I'm very curious what kind of numbers that event does and whether or not it serves as a springboard into sports. For the year, shares of Netflix are up 45%. Finally, every now and again I like to share what our customers at tastytrade are doing. Some of the companies where we're seeing bullish activity include Visa, Meta and Amazon. Meantime, we're seeing more bearish activity in Starbucks, Walmart and Intel. I think the bullish activity is likely a sign that our customers are optimistic about the upcoming holiday season, as well as optimism over continued strength in Meta. As for the bearish activity, I believe with Walmart it is attributable to shoppers trading up. I've spoken about people trading down when money gets tight, moving from retailers like Target to Walmart. I think right now, we're seeing just the opposite as the economy is humming along. With respect to Intel, I think customers may see this company as having fallen too far to recover. Finally, the sentiment in Starbucks could be related to the company's recent struggles prior to naming a new CEO. For today, it is VIX expiration and anytime you get a VIX expiration, you can see some choppy trading. I'm also watching bonds. After having suffered nine consecutive down days, bonds may have bottomed out and interest rates may have topped out. I'm also watching some of these nuclear energy companies to see if they can continue building momentum.

Title: Why Bitcoin Over NVIDIA?

ERIC KIM Here are some quotes from prominent investors explaining why they have sold NVIDIA stock to buy Bitcoin: 1. David Shaw and Steven Cohen have shifted investments from NVIDIA to Bitcoin, citing Bitcoin’s unique properties as a decentralized and finite asset. According to a report, they view Bitcoin as a better hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, risks that NVIDIA, as a tech stock, cannot address. They see Bitcoin as a “digital gold” and a potential long-term store of value, especially appealing in a volatile economic climate . 2. Billionaire Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy is well-known for his support of Bitcoin, describing it as a more compelling long-term asset compared to tech stocks like NVIDIA. He argues that while companies like NVIDIA face market competition and potential saturation, Bitcoin offers unparalleled scarcity and resilience. He believes this gives Bitcoin a “massive long-term potential” that makes it an ideal asset for those seeking a high-risk, high-reward profile in their investment portfolio . 3. According to investment analysts, some high-profile investors view the current AI-driven rally in NVIDIA’s valuation as potentially overextended. They believe that Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralization offer a different type of investment upside, with one analyst noting, “Bitcoin’s future growth prospects outweigh the short-term gains offered by NVIDIA,” especially as Bitcoin becomes more accessible through products like ETFs . These perspectives highlight the view that while NVIDIA’s stock benefits from AI and tech market dynamics, Bitcoin’s qualities as a scarce, decentralized asset offer distinct long-term advantages in diversifying investment portfolios.

Title: How storytelling platform Pratilipi scripted a rare hit

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Bengaluru: During the long hours of pandemic-induced lockdown, some of his friends picked up mobile gaming while others discovered short videos on YouTube and Instagram. But for Rohit Agarwal, a garment shop owner from Tumsar, a town in north-west Maharashtra, it was reading a college love story that sparked a new passion. Within weeks, Agarwal found himself spending hours every day engrossed in reading long-form fiction on Pratilipi, a digital storytelling platform. “There were days when I’d start a book post lunch and finish it by midnight," he recalls. New to reading, Agarwal was surprised to discover the addictive joy in captivating stories and the fictional world of romance and love stories. Soon, Agarwal took a plunge and decided to publish his own stories on the platform, a transition quite common on Pratilipi which has an active community of 1.5 million writers and 6.5 million monthly readers. The startup is a user-generated content platform that allows authors to publish their long-form content in multiple Indian languages. Founded in 2014 and backed by investors like Tencent, Nexus Ventures and Alteria Capital, Pratilipi recently reached a milestone of being cash-flow positive in July 2024. Pratilipi’s revenue in 2023-24 rose by 66% to ₹58 crore, from ₹35 crore the year before.The net loss narrowed by 62% to ₹58 crore last year. Overall, the company has raised $80 million in funding over seven rounds. But the company cannot be measured by its finances alone. In the era of 15-second reels and waning attention spans, Pratilipi’s quest to foster a culture of reading long-form regional literature stands out in India’s content ecosystem—an ecosystem that has seen a massive rise and crash in the last half-decade. Several short video apps that emerged in the last few years tanked while some like Moj, Josh and MXtakatak saw mergers. Popular live-streaming apps disappeared after the China ban, while Koo, an Indian version of Twitter (now X), shut shop earlier this year citing a lack of funding or acquisition interest. While these platforms spent heavily on customer acquisition and creator rewards, some failed to take off and others are still struggling to retain users and build sustainable communities. One of the reasons for Pratilipi’s survival in tough market conditions has been its singular focus on long-form content. While other platforms tried to cash in on the market frenzy of multiple formats like short videos and bite-sized content, Pratilipi stuck to its core offering of in-depth, engaging stories in regional Indian languages. This focused effort has helped the platform build a loyal fanbase of millions of readers—primarily women aged between 18-35 years. “Long-form storytelling will never go out of fashion," says Ranjeet Pratap Singh, founder of Pratilipi. Singh’s journey with Pratilipi is rooted in his conviction and confidence that good stories will always find consumers. That said, Pratilpi’s journey hasn’t always been smooth. Wattpad’s playbookBefore founding Pratilipi in 2014, Singh worked as an area sales manager with Vodafone. In his venture, he wasjoined by Sahradayi Modi, who also worked at Vodafone, and Sankaranarayanan Devarajan, Singh’s batchmate from an MBA school in Delhi.There were two other co-founders— Prashant Gupta and Rahul Ranjan—who left Pratilipi a few years ago to pursue other ventures. In 2014, when Pratilipi launched, Wattpad, the Toronto-based self-publishing platform, was already recognized among the hottest digital media companies. A rage among teen girls, Wattpad, in its eighth year of running, had attained a cult-like status and began monetization in 2014 after reaching 25 million monthly active users. Borrowing several pages from Wattpad’s playbook, Singh says he knew this was a game of patience and execution. View Full Image A screenshot of the Wattpad reading app. “Our first major challenge was to build demand and supply—a classic chicken and egg problem," says Singh. Pratilipi chose to focus on fixing the supply side first. The company reached out to authors through various channels, imploring them to get published on the platform. Writers such as Abhidha Sharma and Jitendra Jeetu were approached. Despite being published, these authors were having difficulty reaching a wide readership. To build an initial content library, the company also picked up a few hundred Indian language titles that were available in the public domain. This strategy, aped from Wattpad’s playbook, helped the company get the initial traction and readers. Eventually, though, the platform had to prove its merit in the original content market. Singh recalls placing a great emphasis on prioritizing its writers and their experience on the platform. Pratilipi introduced initiatives such as workshops for new writers, fellowships for seasoned authors, author chat rooms and a feedback loop between readers and writers. “One of our biggest initial platform challenges was supporting Indian languages," says Singh. Fortunately, the launch and adoption of the Google Indic keyboard took the load off a tech problem for the company. Pratilipi stories are currently available in 12 Indian languages, including Punjabi, Odia and Bengali. Malayalam and Marathi stories are read the most.

To fix this, the company aggressively marketed through Facebook ads. Authors were also encouraged to share their stories within their network. Community initiatives like chat rooms for authors helped build user retention. All these efforts made traditional book publishers sit up and take notice. “Pratilipi’s success in enabling online reading habits has been an eye-opener, changing the perception of traditional publishers," says Gautam Padmanabhan, chief executive of Westland Books, a company Pratilipi acqui-hired in April 2022 after Amazon announced that it was shutting down the publishing house.Acqui-hire is the practice of buying a company to access employees and their skills.“This has forced us to rethink our approach to digital publishing," Padmanabhan added. Early investors, meanwhile, believed in the monetization potential of the platform. Nexus Ventures was one of them. Pratik Poddar, partner at the venture capital firm, explains that their initial investment was driven by the founders’ passion for creating a literature-focused platform in India. However, the global trend of users paying for long-form content and the potential to monetize intellectual property, as seen in the West and China, solidified their decision to invest. Pay to readFor the longest time, the platform was free; authors weren’t paid. This changed in 2020 when Pratilipi introduced a premium app where subscriptions cost ₹150 a month or ₹1,500 a year. In addition, there is also a ‘Superfan’ subscription where readers can subscribe to specific authors for ₹25 a month or ₹250 a year. The app currently has 400,000 monthly paying users.Pratilipi authors now get paid based on engagement generated by paid users on the app, similar to Spotify. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model, where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and feedback. By default, writers own the intellectual property for any story they publish on the platform. However, the company also acquires a small number of stories that it feels can work across various formats such as audio and web series. Authors still retain a share of the revenue generated from these formats. Unlike traditional publishing, Pratilipi follows a chapter-based approach. This model,where authors can publish a chapter of a book, instead of an entire story together, encourages regular writing and allows authors to receive ongoing feedback on the plot twists and turns of their narratives. Shelja Shrivastava,who writes in Hindi, is among the top authors on Pratilipi. She recalls hiring an external editor to proofread and edit her story chapters. “I wasn’t getting paid for my stories back then, but I was willing to spend on an editor because I didn’t want to publish a shoddy story," says Shrivastava, adding that user feedback was paramount to her.

A part-time professor and homeopathic doctor, Shrivastava, on good days writes anywhere between 4,000 to 5,000 words over a couple of hours and makes about ₹35,000 per month through the platform. When she is not as active, her earnings drop to ₹20,000 a month. Popular among the genre of social issues and romance, Shrivastava has built a community of 30,000 followers and 27 million impressions on the platform. Time to buy2020 was also when the company pressed the accelerator on diversification. Inorganic growth was in the offing. Pratilipi expanded into audiobooks and comics. That year, it acquired IVM Podcasts, a podcast platform. Pratilipi FM, the company’s audiobook platform, now has 170,000 monthly active listeners, while Pratilipi Comics, which offers digital comics in six Indian languages, has over 80,000 monthly active readers. The Westland acqui-hire, meanwhile, gave the company expertise in physical publishing. And Westland gained from the digital publishing expertise Pratilipi built over the years. Since the partnership, Westland has adaptedThe Habit Coach, a podcast on the platform, into a book. It also adapted Ruskin Bond’sTales From My Heart into a comic book. Six months to liveFor Pratilipi, building the demand and supply side meant heavy losses—the runway appeared short at a time when the startup world was grappling with a funding winter. Towards the end of last year, Pratilipi faced a financial crisis with depleting funds and a runway of just six months. Reports highlighted news of attrition and layoffs along with the founders foregoing salaries; employee pay cheques got delayed. While the company’s operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ₹41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ₹35 crore. To stabilize the company, marketing costs were significantly cut next year—down to ₹6 crore, or about 10% of revenue in 2023-24. The cuts in marketing affected new signups and monthly active users, but these measures were essential to survival, says Singh. While the company’s operational costs were relatively low, thanks to user-generated content, marketing expenses had consumed a significant portion of their budget. Marketing costs totalled ₹41 crore in 2022-23, far ahead of its revenue of ₹35 crore. During this period, the revenue from Pratilipi’s literature segment remained strong, aiding the company to stay afloat and even grow. In January 2024, the literature segment became cash flow positive, marking a turning point. By July, Pratilipi achieved overall cash flow positivity. Nonetheless, Singh admits to making decisions that have hurt revenue growth. For instance, the Pratilipi app doesn’t have an erotica category—although there is plenty of romance—because many writers on the platform insisted on “keeping the platform family-friendly." The next chapterWhile erotica is an opportunity lost, intellectual property licensing is emerging as a significant revenue source for the company, one that can provide a solid financial foundation for the future. In the last few years, Pratilipi titles likeLove Biye Aaj Kal,Imlie andDehati Ladke have been adapted into TV and web series.Dehati Ladke is also on its way to be a comic. Global trends indicate that stories that work in one medium often tend to perform well in others.For instance, the release of TV shows based on books increases the sales of books. Pratilipi wants to capitalize on this trend by expanding its intellectual property across various formats. This move positions them to better compete in the regional content market. The platform charges a flat fee of approximately ₹10-15 lakh for a story adaptation or 1-2% of the production budget. Alternatively, Pratilipi works with partners to co-develop screen adaptations, charging a fee in the range of ₹20-50 lakh alongside a share of the production budget. The startup is partnering with TV studios and production houses, like Disney Star and Amazon, to adapt its stories into web series and movies. Singh announced that as the company prepares for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026, it plans to intensify its efforts in intellectual property licensing and expand into the Middle East and the US markets. International expansion is crucial considering the limitations of the Indian regional language market. Pratilipi’s primary audience—non-English readers from smaller towns—are cost-conscious consumers. While loyal, they are accustomed to making smaller purchases. For the startup to reach the next level, it needs to significantly expand its user base, say industry watchers. Raising subscription prices would be counterproductive. Instead, the company needs to reach a wider audience and increase page views, following a similar monetization strategy to Facebook. Whether Pratilipi can replicate the money-making model of Facebook, or the success story of Wattpad, will depend on its future execution and the ability to deliver on its promises. Singh believes he can. “Great stories travel across formats," he says, adding that everyone in the consumer tech business is vying for user attention and time. “Our competition is to be consistently better than Candy Crush." Before founding Pratilipi in 2014, Singh worked as an area sales manager with Vodafone. In his venture, he wasjoined by Sahradayi Modi, who also worked at Vodafone, and Sankaranarayanan Devarajan, Singh’s batchmate from an MBA school in Delhi.There were two other co-founders— Prashant Gupta and Rahul Ranjan—who left Pratilipi a few years ago to pursue other ventures.

Alternatively, Pratilipi works with partners to co-develop screen adaptations, charging a fee in the range of ₹20-50 lakh alongside a share of the production budget. The startup is partnering with TV studios and production houses, like Disney Star and Amazon, to adapt its stories into web series and movies. Singh announced that as the company prepares for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026, it plans to intensify its efforts in intellectual property licensing and expand into the Middle East and the US markets. International expansion is crucial considering the limitations of the Indian regional language market. Pratilipi’s primary audience—non-English readers from smaller towns—are cost-conscious consumers. While loyal, they are accustomed to making smaller purchases. For the startup to reach the next level, it needs to significantly expand its user base, say industry watchers. Raising subscription prices would be counterproductive. Instead, the company needs to reach a wider audience and increase page views, following a similar monetization strategy to Facebook. Whether Pratilipi can replicate the money-making model of Facebook, or the success story of Wattpad, will depend on its future execution and the ability to deliver on its promises. Singh believes he can. “Great stories travel across formats," he says, adding that everyone in the consumer tech business is vying for user attention and time. “Our competition is to be consistently better than Candy Crush." While erotica is an opportunity lost, intellectual property licensing is emerging as a significant revenue source for the company, one that can provide a solid financial foundation for the future. In the last few years, Pratilipi titles likeLove Biye Aaj Kal,Imlie andDehati Ladke have been adapted into TV and web series.Dehati Ladke is also on its way to be a comic. Global trends indicate that stories that work in one medium often tend to perform well in others.For instance, the release of TV shows based on books increases the sales of books.

U.S. stock futures are little changed after Tuesday's tech selloff; ASML Holding (ASML) shares are continuing to move lower in premarket trading after the semiconductor-gear manufacturer's stock tanked yesterday as it reported third-quarter results a day earlier than expected; shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are rebounding slightly after stepping back from record highs as chipmakers struggled on industry worries; Stellantis (STLA) reports a 20% decline in Q3 worldwide shipments; and United Airlines (UAL) announces a $1.5 billion share buyback program as it reports better-than-expected earnings. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed in premarket trading Wednesday following a selloff yesterday on sharp declines for technology and energy shares. Crude oil futures are lower after Tuesday's decline amid easing tensions in the Middle East and news that the International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered its outlook for energy demand growth. Gold futures are higher. New York Registry Shares of ASML Holding (ASML) are declining a further 3% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker projected that its 2025 net sales would come in lower than previously projected. The company released its earnings report a day early on Tuesday, revealing a weaker-than-expected outlook, which sent its shares tumbling 16%. The company also reported third-quarter net bookings that were well below analyst estimates. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are up about 1% in premarket trading after the tech giant's shares fell nearly 5% Tuesday. Shares had reached an all-time closing high the prior session after bullish comments from analysts who cited the chipmaker's dominance in the accelerator market. Investors also were spooked yesterday by a report that the U.S. could curb AI chip sales to some Middle East countries. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) also are rebounding slightly after dropping 5% Tuesday. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) reported shipments dropped 20% year-over-year in the third quarter, including a 36% decline in deliveries to North America amid high dealer inventory levels. The results come soon after the maker of Jeep and Chrysler issued a profit warning, citing "deterioration in global industry dynamics" and competition from Chinese rivals. Shares of Stellantis are edging higher in premarket trading. United Airlines (UAL) announced a $1.5 billion share buyback plan while reporting third-quarter earnings that were better than analyst estimates. The airline posted quarterly revenue of $14.84 billion, better than consensus estimates of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.33 also beat projections. United's results stand in contrast to the weaker-than-expected earnings from rival Delta Air Lines (DAL). Shares of United are up by more than 1% in premarket trading.

ERIC KIM Here is a list comparing the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and top tech stocks as of 2024, reflecting their risk-adjusted returns: 1. Bitcoin: Sharpe ratio around 1.3, driven by high volatility and significant price momentum during bullish phases . 2. Tesla (TSLA): Sharpe ratio around 0.9 to 1.2, with high volatility tied to its growth trajectory in the EV sector Ratios | ETC Group. 3. Nvidia (NVDA): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.3, benefiting from high demand in the AI and semiconductor industries but also showing notable price swings Ratios | ETC Group. 4. Apple (AAPL): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 1.0, reflecting steady performance with moderate volatility compared to other tech stocks Ratios | ETC Group. 5. Amazon (AMZN): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 0.9, with volatility tied to both e-commerce trends and cloud computing growth . 6. Microsoft (MSFT): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.0, reflecting strong performance and relatively lower volatility due to its diversified business segments . 7. Meta (META): Sharpe ratio around 0.6 to 0.9, impacted by volatility as it transitions into the metaverse space, leading to fluctuations in its stock value . 8. NASDAQ 100 Index (QQQ): Sharpe ratio around 0.9, capturing the broader tech sector’s risk-adjusted return and benefiting from diversification . Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio often aligns with or exceeds those of individual high-growth tech stocks due to its high potential returns, but also carries a much higher volatility, leading to similar risk-adjusted returns as these tech leaders. … As of recent analyses, here are some specific Sharpe ratio figures comparing Bitcoin and the S&P 500: 1. Bitcoin: In 2023, Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio averaged around 0.82, reflecting its high volatility alongside periods of substantial returns . This figure has fluctuated due to Bitcoin’s rapid price movements and recent lower volatility, as it matured amidst institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. 2. S&P 500: The S&P 500 achieved a Sharpe ratio of approximately 0.95 over the same period . This higher ratio compared to Bitcoin suggests more consistent risk-adjusted returns, benefiting from the stability of a diversified portfolio of established companies in the index. Historically, these ratios can vary depending on economic conditions, but generally, the S&P 500 maintains a slight edge over Bitcoin in terms of risk-adjusted performance due to its lower volatility and more predictable returns. … As of recent data, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has generally been lower compared to the S&P 500, reflecting Bitcoin’s high volatility despite its strong performance. Over the past year, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has hovered around 0.82, while the S&P 500 achieved a slightly higher ratio of approximately 0.95 . Historically, Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns have varied more than the S&P 500’s due to its price volatility, which has sometimes exceeded 50% annually. However, in 2023 and into early 2024, Bitcoin saw reduced volatility, potentially signifying a maturing asset class. During this period, Bitcoin’s market performance was significantly enhanced by institutional adoption and regulatory developments, such as Bitcoin ETF approvals . In comparison, the S&P 500 maintains more consistent risk-adjusted returns, typically benefiting from its diversification across major U.S. companies. The lower volatility and stable returns of the S&P 500 contribute to its Sharpe ratio advantage over Bitcoin, especially in periods when economic and regulatory factors reduce Bitcoin’s appeal as a high-risk asset .

Title: CVS and Walgreens are ailing. Here’s why
URL: https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5154129/cvs-and-walgreens-closing-stores-why
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:34:11Z

Alina Selyukh Walgreens said Tuesday it would close 1,200 stores. Rival drugstore chain CVS recently laid off thousands of employees to cut costs. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption Not too long after Tim Wentworth became CEO of Walgreens, he revealed a stunning figure: Roughly a quarter of the pharmacy chain’s stores do not make money. On Tuesday, he said 1,200 of those stores will close over three years. That’s two weeks after rival CVS announced layoffs of 2,900 corporate staff. Both chains are on a multibillion-dollar cost-saving spree — closing hundreds of locations, cutting thousands of jobs and, really, reconsidering their role in Americans’ lives. The slow simmer of mistakes and misfortunes has come to a boil for the biggest U.S. drugstore chains. They’ve accumulated too many stores at a time of changing shopper habits. They’re saddled with numerous government fines and a particularly ailing relationship with health insurers. CVS and Walgreens have some notable differences. Walgreens, which also owns the British drugstore Boots, is more singularly focused on its pharmacy business. CVS has expanded further into health care through mergers with insurer Aetna and Caremark, a pharmacy benefit manager that helps insurers negotiate prescription drug coverage and costs. Yet the two companies have made similar missteps. The simplest part of the problem is scale. CVS and Walgreens grew massive nationwide footprints of more than 9,000 and 8,000 stores, respectively. They gobbled up mom-and-pop shops and signed long-term leases for prime locations on street corners. A chain with a padlock secures freezer doors at a San Francisco Walgreens store in July 2023. The store padlocked its freezers to thwart shoplifters who had been stealing frozen pizzas and ice cream. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption Now, shoppers regularly complain about chronically understaffed stores, with products locked up to prevent theft. The shelves of snacks, makeup, greeting cards and cleaning products were meant to boost profits. But sales have sagged for years — a result of a losing battle with Amazon, Walmart, Costco, grocery and dollar stores. CVS and Walgreens “probably do have too many stores because they overexpanded, but the bigger problem is that the stores that they have are not very good,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst at the firm GlobalData. The chains have failed to add new incentives for shoppers, beyond photo booths and returns drop-off centers, says Anshuman Jaiswal, a longtime consultant to retailers and pharmacies. And neither chain has built a meaningful online presence designed to give customers what they need. “If you go to CVS.com or Walgreens.com, if you are placing an order for cough syrup, why don't I sell chicken broth as a product recommendation immediately?” Jaiswal says. “It's about reimagining the business model.” Given the retail struggles, pharmacies could perhaps simply ditch the convenience store and focus on selling medicine — except CVS and Walgreens say it’s harder and harder to make a profit from this part of their business. Years ago, a big shift in the power balance between pharmacies and health insurers revealed the limits of drugstores’ leverage. “Historically, there was a view that there was a lot of customer loyalty to their specific retail pharmacy … and that patients, or consumers, would be all up in arms if they were forced to move their prescriptions,” says Brian Tanquilut, health care services analyst at the investment bank Jefferies. Walgreens tested this theory about a decade ago when it got into a public fight with Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager that worked with major health insurers. Walgreens and Express Scripts played a game of chicken over how much Walgreens should earn from prescriptions — and Walgreens lost. For a time, it got kicked out of insurance networks used by millions of people, who simply went elsewhere to get their medicine at the lower in-network prices. “What that did was to prove that patient loyalty is not to the retail pharmacy, but it actually is whatever my insurance is willing to pay,” Tanquilut says. “And that opened the door for the payers to keep pushing pricing down on retail pharmacy chains.” These days, CVS and Walgreens are facing tough competition from pharmacies that don’t depend as much on profits from prescriptions because they’re part of retail giants, including Walmart and Costco. The drugstore chains also have spent millions of dollars on government fines over allegations of unsafe staffing levels, overbilling government insurance programs and contributing to the opioid epidemic. Over the years, CVS and Walgreens attempted to reframe themselves as health care hubs, expanding primary-care clinics. But these operations cost time and money. On Tuesday, Walgreens CEO Wentworth said his chain is “reorienting to its legacy strength as a retail pharmacy-led company.” CVS is reportedly weighing a breakup to undo its mergers with Aetna and Caremark. Both companies are also proposing new structures for how they want to be paid for filling prescriptions, hoping this is the big shot in the arm they need. "I'm very confident that over a two- to three-year period we will have reset the framework for reimbursement discussions," Wentworth told investors on Tuesday. “We are in the early stages of a turnaround that will take time.” Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Meta Platforms target holds amid AI spending forecast
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/meta-platforms-target-holds-amid-ai-spending-forecast-93CH-3665777

Cantor Fitzgerald maintained an Overweight rating on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META) with a steady price target of $670.00. The firm's analysis suggests that Meta and its major AI industry competitors are likely to continue their aggressive investment in infrastructure due to the AI arms race. The projection follows recent reports on OpenAI's internal projections, which anticipate a quadrupling of total compute costs to approximately $24 billion by the fiscal year 2026, including $15 billion in training and $9 billion on inference costs. According to the analyst, the consensus capital expenditure (Capex) estimates for Meta, sourced from Visible Alpha, are $47 billion for the fiscal year 2025 and $49 billion for 2026, up from $38 billion in 2024. These figures might not fully account for the costs associated with staying competitive in state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and Meta's AI inference needs, including the construction of new data centers (DCs). The firm also anticipates that consensus estimates for depreciation and amortization (D&A) might see upward revisions from the current projections of $19 billion for 2025 and $23 billion for 2026. The analysis suggests that Meta could aim to significantly expand its compute capacity to over 2.5 million GPUs within the next 2-3 years, a substantial increase from its current capacity of over 600,000 GPUs. The forecasted Capex spend for 2025 and 2026 is likely to include more than 2 million GPUs, amounting to over $40 billion. When combined with other server assets and data center additions, Meta's cumulative Capex for these years could surpass $100 billion, which is a considerable increase compared to current expectations. This investment is seen as a response to the competitive pressures in the rapidly evolving AI technology landscape. Meta Platforms Inc. is set to confront state lawsuits alleging that the company's social media platforms contribute to addiction among teenagers. The federal judge rejected Meta's attempt to dismiss the claims, allowing the case to proceed. In financial developments, Stifel raised its price target for Meta to $663, maintaining a 'Buy' rating on the stock. Roth/MKM and Truist Securities have also raised their price targets for Meta, showing optimism in the company's medium and long-term prospects. Meanwhile, Meta has taken significant strides in combating disinformation by dismantling a network of fake accounts targeting users in Moldova ahead of the country's presidential election and EU membership referendum. Meta Platforms Inc.'s aggressive investment strategy in AI infrastructure aligns with its strong financial position and market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Meta boasts a market capitalization of $1.48 trillion and has demonstrated impressive revenue growth of 24.28% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This robust growth supports the company's ability to fund substantial capital expenditures in AI technology.

US stocks were muted on Wednesday as investors digested results from Morgan Stanley (MS) and others to potentially power a rebound to record highs after an ASML (ASML)-fueled slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were all near flat at the open. All three major gauges pulled back from all-time highs on Tuesday as ASML's deep cut to its 2025 sales forecast dented faith in the AI chip trade, driving down stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). Markets are on alert for any fresh news from ASML on the day the chip tool maker's apparently accidentally released earnings were scheduled to land. Morgan Stanley's quarterly report before the bell showed fresh signs of the Wall Street comeback that has boosted big bank earnings this week. Profits jumped compared to last year, thanks to a rise in dealmaking that has also lifted its peers. Shares rose more than 6% following the release. At the same time, disappointing earnings from ASML, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and luxury stalwart LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY) have an otherwise bullish Wall Street on the lookout for signs of weakness elsewhere. Abbott (ABT), Alcoa (AA), and Discover Financial Services (DFS) are on the docket on Wednesday. In commodities, gold (GC=F) rallied toward a fresh record high as fresh tariff promises from Republican nominee Donald Trump added to uncertainty around the outcome of the tight US presidential race. Morgan Stanley (MS) stock jumped 4% at the open after the company reported large year-over-year increases across a variety of metrics in its third quarter earnings release. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Fees from investment banking jumped 56% from a year ago, the largest leap among big banks, to nearly $1.4 billion. The pick-up in investment banking and an increase in trading helped Morgan Stanley push its net profit up by 32% from a year earlier, to $3.2 billion. The results cement a broad rebound across the Wall Street operations of the country's biggest banks. Investment banking fees and equity trading revenue also jumped at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C). Read more here.

US stock futures took a breather on Wednesday as investors waited for results from Morgan Stanley (MS) and others to potentially power a rebound to record highs after an ASML (ASML)-fueled slide. Futures on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) hugged the flatline, while contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) were down 0.1%. All three major gauges pulled back from all-time highs on Tuesday as ASML's deep cut to its 2025 sales forecast dented faith in the AI chip trade, driving down stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). Markets are on alert for any fresh news from ASML on the day the chip tool maker's apparently accidentally released earnings were scheduled to land. Eyes are on Morgan Stanley's quarterly report before the bell for signs of the Wall Street comeback that has boosted big bank earnings this week. A strong showing would give weight to optimism that the US economy is headed for a "soft landing". At the same time, disappointing earnings from ASML, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and luxury stalwart LVMH (MC.PA, LVMUY) have an otherwise bullish Wall Street on the lookout for signs of weakness elsewhere.

The average price of a new car was $48,397 in September, according to Kelley Blue Book. Dealer discounts and other incentives fell this past summer, keeping prices relatively stable. Discover More: 6 SUVs That Last Longer Than You Think and Are Worth the Money Check Out: 4 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 As of Q2 2024, some of the best-selling vehicles were full-sized trucks like the Ford F-150, which had an average sales price of $67,443. The prices of electric vehicles (EVs) also have risen recently, though they’re still 0.9% lower than they were in September 2023. If you’re in the market for a new vehicle, or you’re thinking of selling one you already own, it helps to know what’s ranking high and what’s not. Here are eight car models that could have significant price drops in November, according to automotive experts. Also see reliable cars to buy before winter. Typical starting MSRP: $27,415 “I can say that the Toyota Camry has been a reliable and popular sedan, but with the 2024 model already out, the 2023 version is likely to see discounts, especially if dealerships are trying to clear inventory,” said Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing for CFR Classic. “It’s a solid car; but, when newer models come in, prices naturally drop.” For added context, the 2025 model has a starting MSRP of $28,400. Given that the price difference is marginal, the older models might need to be marked down to sell.

Suze Orman Says You're Missing This Key Money Move Typical starting MSRP: $29,495 With many consumers switching to more compact vehicles, the Ford Escape might lose value. “The Ford Escape has been facing strong competition in the compact SUV market,” Giranda said. “I believe that dealers will likely offer good discounts on the 2023 model to make room for newer stock, particularly with the growing preference for electric and hybrid SUVs.” The 2025 model has a starting MSRP of $27,995 to $38,400. For You: These 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle Typical starting MSRP: $28,390 “Much like the Camry, I think the 2023 Honda Accord will see price cuts,” Giranda said. “Honda is set to release its 2024 lineup, so dealers will be pushing to clear the older models to make space for the new ones.” If this happens, the older vehicles likely will see markdowns. As dealerships take on even newer models, older ones could drop even more. Typical starting MSRP: $83,890 The Cadillac Escalade has a history of depreciating by roughly 40% in the first five years. It also often has issues when it comes to things like the dashboard and brake fluid leaks. “Buyers are becoming more aware of vehicle depreciation and reliability and they’re not as willing to pay a high price for a name or status,” said Melanie Musson, an auto industry expert with CarInsurance.org. “So, Escalades will likely have to lower their price to keep buyers buying.” Plus, the Cadillac Escalade 2025 has a starting MSRP of $89,590. If the 2024 model stays in high demand, its price could remain stable. Otherwise, it could drop. Typical starting MSRP: $34,095 The Fiat 500e is reasonably priced right now, but Musson is concerned it will drop in price due to its low range of about 80 to 120 miles. “Some people wouldn’t even be able to complete a round-trip commute with that range,” she said. “They’re not popular, so sales are stagnant. A price drop could get them moving again.” Read More: 4 Affordable Car Brands You Won’t Regret Buying in 2024 Typical starting MSRP: $27,495 Giranda noted that the Chevrolet Bolt EV is a solid contender as far as EVs go. But with newer models coming out each year and consumers expecting the latest tech, its pricing could see a downward trend. “I believe that 2023 models will drop in price as consumers shift towards more up-to-date options,” he said. Typical starting MSRP: $62,995 EVs might be popular — though perhaps not with every consumer — but the Ford Lightning could lose value as the end of the year approaches. “The public is not as enamored with EVs as predicted, especially when it comes to those looking for a truck,” Musson said. “Most people buy trucks because they need the capabilities a truck can give them for towing and hauling. An EV truck will have drastically lower range when towing. Buyers don’t like that.” Typical starting MSRP: $29,230 Giranda also predicted that the 2023 Nissan Rogue will have a notable price drop as dealerships start bringing in newer models. Not only that, but as the industry gears more toward hybrid and electric vehicles, traditional gas-powered SUVs like the Rogue might lose their appeal. Like other cars on this list, the difference in price points between the older model (2023) and the newest one (2025) is almost negligible. The 2025 Nissan Rogue is expected to be priced at about $30,620. Given this, dealerships could reduce prices for the older vehicles on their lot to make room for the new.

Title: ‘Students are frustrated’: College seniors seeking tech jobs face a chilly hiring market
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/16/tech-industry-job-market-hiring-college-graduates/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
When the current class of college seniors started their studies four years ago, tech companies were hiring new graduates as fast as they could. Now, amid a downturn in Silicon Valley that has included thousands of layoffs, job seekers who are about to get their diplomas are scrambling to find work. The signs of trouble are easy to spot at University of California at Berkeley, usually a hotbed for tech recruiting. “Students are frustrated,” Santina Pitcher, senior associate director of employer relations at U.C. Berkeley’s career center, tells Fortune. The unease among job seekers is being felt across the country. Once a sponge for new graduates, the tech industry has cut back on filling high-paying jobs and is far more selective. So far this year, tech companies laid off nearly 140,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks job cuts. That’s on top of more than 264,000 people cut from tech last year. Things won’t necessarily get better anytime soon for college graduates. Silicon Valley is increasingly using artificial intelligence to help software engineers speed up the process of writing code, reducing the need for hiring more programmers. In a potential sign of the shift, job postings for software engineers have fallen more than 160% since post-pandemic hiring peaked in March 2022, according to data from Indeed, the online job board. That’s a far bigger drop than for non-tech roles. In response to the souring market, young professionals are seeking tech jobs outside the usual suspects, such as with small businesses and government, according to new data from Handshake, a recruiting site for college students. It found that 42% of today’s computer science students have applied for full-time jobs at small businesses, up from around 25% in 2022. Of any college major, that’s the largest jump in interest in small businesses, defined as having 250 workers or less. Such companies may not have the perks of bigger ones like ping-pong tables and offsite retreats at wellness ranches, but they can offer more stable roles and a direct social impact on local communities, Handshake’s report notes. Another report by Handshake in May found that the Class of 2024 is applying to more government jobs. About 7.5% of job applications from new grads were for public sector work, up from 5.5% for the Class of 2023. Overall, the job market is relatively strong. The U.S. added 254,000 jobs in total in September, according to federal government employment data. The gains were largely driven by hiring in the education and health sectors, leisure and hospitality, and government. In contrast, the information services sector, which includes the tech industry, grew slowly, contributing less than 10,000 jobs last month. At Berkeley, the shift in the tech industry is having a big impact. The number of employers showing up at STEM-major career fairs has remained relatively stable since the pandemic at around 100. But aside from Alphabet’s self-driving car unit Waymo, Big Tech is absent. Instead, the sponsors include Bloomberg and TikTok, along with the U.S. State Department and the Peace Corps. “I’m seeing more interest from startups and smaller companies, and the bigger ones are backing off a little bit,” Pitcher said. At Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, a similar trend is playing out, said Kevin Collins, associate director of the campus career center. Students must work harder to land roles than they did before the pandemic. His advice: Look beyond the usual online job boards, attend networking events, and be more open minded about employers. “They’re still doing tech roles, but they’re doing it in different industries and smaller companies in general,” Collins said. Carnegie Mellon is known for strong robotics and computer science programs, and its graduates have historically been snapped up by the likes of Google and Uber. This year it topped College Transition’s list of schools that feed talent to Silicon Valley. And while there are still opportunities for new grads in Big Tech, Collins said, huge West Coast tech companies have scaled back their once aggressive campus recruiting efforts since the pandemic. Instead, some tech students are taking jobs in traditional industries, like financial services, he said. “It’s probably a healthier market in the sense it is broader,” Collins said. Madeleine Brutin knew the job market would be competitive when she started as a Carnegie Mellon student in 2022. The day she got her university email address, she says she messaged the career services office. As a freshman, she’d already heard from upperclassmen about the competitiveness of the job market, as companies rescinded offers amid post-pandemic downsizing. Searching for a full-time position is still stressful today, Brutin said. “You can go months or days without hearing from a company, and you’re at a fork in the road where you’re wondering should you apply more? Should you build more skills? Or should you just keep waiting?” she said. Brutin, who studies computational finance, looked beyond the Silicon Valley “pure tech” companies. While still job hunting, she already secured an offer for a full-time position at Bloomberg after previously interning there. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: YieldMax™ ETFs Announces Distributions on FIAT (105.76%), CONY (101.35%), ULTY (100.99%), YMAX (51.97%), YMAG (62.33%) and Others

October 16, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Oct. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs (except YMAX,YMAG and ULTY) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. ULTY has a gross expense ratio of 1.24% but the investment adviser has agreed to a 0.10% fee waiver through at least February 28, 2025. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 15, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended September 30. 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. As of such date, the ULTY subsidized and unsubsidized 30-Day SEC Yields were 0.00% and 0.00%, respectively. The subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect while the unsubsidized yield does not adjust for any fee waivers in effect. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 As of the date hereof, distributions for the following ETFs have included return of investor capital: TSLY, OARK, APLY, AMZY, NVDY, GOOY, JPMO, XOMO, PYPY, CONY, DISO, FBY, MSFO, NFLY, SQY, AMDY, MRNY, AIYY, MSTY, ULTY, YMAX, YMAG, YBIT, SNOY, CRSH,GDXY and FIAT. For additional information, please visit www.YieldMaxETFs.com/TaxInfo. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Standardized Performance For YMAX, click here. For YMAG, click here. For TSLY, click here. For OARK, click here. For APLY, click here.

There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTY), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings There's no doubt that Big Tech is in the bull market's driver's seat — but it's got company. Though the major indexes are narrowly in the green this October, they have been boosted by third quarter earnings from Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which reported a big beat on investment banking fees. More significantly, the so-called "fins" have rallied alongside three others — tech, consumer discretionary, and industrials — to outperform the S&P 500 since the Japanese yen-induced panic of Aug. 5. All four sectors are up about 15%, with a slight edge to tech. (The low is important technically because it marks the bottom of the year's biggest decline — a quite normal 8.5%). It might seem familiar — and perhaps a bit unnerving — that "tech is leading" once again after the concentration hand-wringing over the "Magnificent Seven." But unlike other periods in this bull market — now two years old — tech has some company, thanks to money flowing, or rotating, into other sectors. It's a process as old as public markets. As the godfather of technical analysis, Ralph Acampora, CMT, famously quipped, "Sector rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market." Ralph's nephew, Jay Woods, who is an executive NYSE floor governor and chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, recently joined Stocks In Translation to break down the concept. "Money's not leaving the market, it's just going from one sector to the next to the next," said Woods, noting the strength in software stocks. He specifically highlighted cybersecurity plays like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Cisco (CSCO) — both damaged stocks at one time that are now leading. Woods reflects on Cisco's round-trip journey right back to its dot-com bubble highs. "I hate that I like Cisco right now," Woods said. "I liked it in '99, and it's right where it was trading in 1999. That's amazing." In fact, the tech sector leadership of today stands in stark contrast with earlier in the year, when the Mag Seven stocks dominated. Although perennial leader Nvidia (NVDA) is up 30% since the Aug. 5 low, IBM (IBM) is close on its heels — rising from its legacy tech ashes to fresh records. For that matter, more than 20 stocks in the S&P 500 are doing better than Nvidia since the yen low, led by electric power company Vistra Corp. (VST) and United Airlines (UAL) — up 85% and 70%, respectively. Many of these stocks are simply laggards that got beaten up in the 2022 bear market and left behind. But even among the overextended, there are still potential winners to be found. "Put up a five-year weekly chart in utilities for me. Talk about a nice rounded base and then a breakout," Woods said, adding, "[These are] not your grandparents' utilities anymore."

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-2.43%) (TSMC) is expected to beat revenue expectations for the third quarter when it reports quarterly earnings Thursday. The Taiwanese chipmaker is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.24%). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter. The company set its third-quarter guidance between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. Meanwhile, TSMC is expected to report $9.3 billion in net income for the third quarter, according to FactSet. The chipmaker’s shares were down 2.63% at the market close Tuesday. However, its stock is up 84.3% so far this year. TSMC announced net revenue of $7.82 billion for September — an increase of 0.4% from the previous month and an almost 40% increase year over year. Revenue for January through September grew 31.9% from the previous year, TSMC said. The chipmaker, which counts Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) and Apple (AAPL+1.23%) as customers, has seen its sales climb amid the generative artificial intelligence boom. In July, TSMC beat analysts’ expectations for the second quarter, reporting revenue of $20.82 billion — up 40% from a year ago. Wendell Huang, the chief financial officer of TSMC, said in a statement that the company expects smartphone- and AI-related demand to drive business in the third quarter. C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, said he expects chip production to catch up to demand by 2025 or 2026. In August, TSMC reported revenue of NT$250.87 billion ($7.8 billion) — a 33% increase from the previous year. The company’s August sales were down 2.4% from July, which saw a 45% surge year over year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple is losing out to Huawei in China. Here's why

Since releasing its Mate 60 Pro series last August, Chinese tech giant Huawei has made a comeback in China’s smartphone market, knocking Apple (AAPL+1.23%) from its pedestal. Huawei and other homegrown smartphone makers have experienced double-digit growth this year, boosting smartphone shipments in China by 8.9% year-over-year in the second quarter, according to the International Data Corporation. China’s Vivo, Huawei, Oppo, Honor — a former subsidiary of Huawei — and Xiaomi made up the top sharers of China’s smartphone market, respectively. Apple, meanwhile, fell to sixth place. And despite cutting prices on some iPhone models to compete, the data showed Apple’s year-over-year sales declined 3.1%. Apple’s iPhone shipments in China experienced “marginal decline” in the second quarter of this year, Counterpoint Research said, noting that during the same period last year, Apple had the third-highest number of shipments — only behind Oppo and Vivo — while Huawei was in sixth place. Apple’s fall in China can be tied to many factors, experts said, including the country’s faltering economy and changes in how its citizens view their country versus the rest of the world amid the pandemic and the growing number of sanctions imposed by the West. “There’s a higher degree of nationalist sentiment right now within China, of buying local and buying the home team versus buying an American product,” Arthur Dong, professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz. Since Huawei was placed on the U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 under former President Donald Trump, the company has faced increasingly tough trade restrictions under President Joe Biden — especially on the latest generation of semiconductors such as those from Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%), Dong said. Escalating trade rules on China and Huawei are putting the tech company, which has ties to the Chinese government and which Dong called “a national champion for the Chinese economy,” “in a tough spot right now.” “Huawei is scrambling right now to try to find alternative sources for these all-important chips, as well as some very significant self-development efforts to try to replicate these technologies and build chips on their own,” Dong said. “With regard to that issue, China is having a really difficult time being able to replicate the chips that sort of fuel AI advancements simply because they don’t have access to the tools and the machinery that build these chips, all of which are within the confines of U.S. export controls.” Dong said he doesn’t see the current situation getting better for Huawei. With another round of restrictions expected over the next few months, the “gaps” that China and Huawei depend on to move around sanctions “are going to be closed,” he said. In the early 2010s, Apple was seen as a “legitimate, ultimate symbol of status,” Andy Tsay, professor of business and analytics at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business, told Quartz. Tsay, who is also a visiting professor in Peking University’s MBA program, said his friends in China would “place their orders” with him for iPhones because Apple’s products were more difficult to find there and there were shortages. Now, there are more Apple Stores in the country. “There really was no comparison, no competitor,” Tsay, who has visited China roughly every year since 2006, said. “Now, people still think Apple is a fine and legitimate luxury product. But the difference is, they’re not fanboys and fangirls anymore.” On his most recent visit to China a few months ago, Tsay asked his MBA students, part of China’s professional class, what they thought about their iPhones. While his students told him that they are satisfied with their iPhones, they also said their next phone “won’t necessarily be an Apple,” and that “there are some Chinese options that are pretty good.” “I’ll get whichever phone has the best price-to-benefit ratio,” Tsay’s students told him. In 2020, Huawei had 18% of the world market for smartphones, Dong said. Two years later, that number fell to 2%, largely because Huawei was restricted from necessary chips and components, he said, and he doesn’t see the company rebounding soon. “They’re still facing challenges in the Chinese market because the overall consumer economy of China has gone into a tailspin,” Dong said. “Apple’s problems are mostly related to the fact that the Chinese consumer has gone into hibernation and they can’t afford this kind of phone because their entire economy is, in a sense, collapsing.” Huawei’s growing sales are “only because their phones are a lot cheaper than Apple’s phones,” Dong said. If Huawei and other Chinese smartphone makers are offering cheaper alternatives, consumers will want those smartphones, he added. China is “more isolated” than it was during its superpower status in the 2010s, Tsay said, likely due to anti-Chinese sentiments stemming from the pandemic. Meanwhile, companies are “trying to extricate themselves from being too reliant on China,” and Western governments continue to ban China’s access to certain technologies, such as equipment to build advanced semiconductors. “You combine that all together with the rise of domestic products, and if people, locally, can feel a little bit good about themselves by supporting the home team, there’s a little bit of something in the trend,” Tsay said. There are two views of the AI chips in Huawei’s smartphones, Dong said. “On the one hand, it could send us an alarming signal that China has the ability to create their homegrown chips,” Dong said. “But there are other stories that you will see where these chips have been examined and the engineering analysis on them is that they’re not even close to the capabilities of what Nvidia is producing — that it’s actually several generations and years behind.” Despite Huawei’s “headline-grabbing” announcements about developing its own chips, Dong said he finds it difficult to imagine how the company has made its advanced chips without access to critical machines and components under trade restrictions. “This is perhaps more bark and less bite when it comes to this announcement that they have advanced-level chips,” Dong said. The competition between Apple and Huawei in China is also tied to the difference in what Apple can offer its U.S. consumers versus its Chinese consumers, Tsay said. Apple’s advantage in the U.S. is its control over its ecosystem, according to Tsay, allowing it to deliver a differentiated user experience. China, however, has a “unique situation” where its “version” of Apple’s iOS is WeChat. “You almost don’t need the tightly integrated, walled garden of the Apple ecosystem in China to deliver that experience because it already exists inside the WeChat world,” Tsay said. “That gives the local cell phone companies an advantage in the sense that they can use Android or their own version of Android or a brand new operating system — they don’t need to create that self-contained ecosystem that Apple has so painstakingly created over the years because Tencent (TCEHY+4.36%) already did it for them by creating WeChat.” The one place the two companies differ, Tsay said, is with Apple’s security and privacy features. “Of course, nobody in China has any expectation of security and privacy when they are online,” he said.

Title: Nvidia Price Levels to Watch as Stock Retreats From Record

Time Published: 2024-10-16T02:32:16Z

Nvidia (NVDA) shares will likely remain on investors’ radar screens after falling sharply Tuesday, just a day after setting a record closing high. The decline Tuesday came as Bloomberg reported that the Biden Administration is mulling AI chip export curbs to some Middle Eastern countries. The news tempered optimism about surging demand for Nvidia's chips from tech giants hyperscaling their AI infrastructure amid a backdrop of tight supply. Nvidia shares fell 4.7% Tuesday to close at $131.60. Below, we break down the technicals on Nvidia’s chart and identify important price levels that investors will likely be watching. Nvidia shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle between June and September before breaking out above the pattern earlier this month. Although the breakout signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend, it’s worth pointing out that the move occurred on below-average volume, indicating a lack of conviction behind the move. Conversely, Tuesday’s selling registered the highest daily share turnover in nearly a month, raising the possibility of a potential bull trap, a trading event that lures investors into buying a breakout before the price makes a sudden reversal. Let’s take a look at three important support levels on the AI chipmaker’s chart and also use technical analysis to forecast a potential bullish price target above the stock’s all-time high (ATH). The first sits around $125, where the shares find a confluence of support from the symmetrical triangle’s top trendline and a horizontal line connecting a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between early June and late September. A decisive breakdown below this level would confirm a bull trap, which could trigger a move down to the $115 level, where the stock may encounter buying interest near the triangle’s lower trendline and multiple minor peaks and troughs stretching back to late May. Further selling could see the shares revisit major support around $97, a location on the chart currently just below the upward sloping 200-day moving average (MA) where investors could look for buying opportunities near the twin March peaks and prices situated just above the August low. Investors can forecast a bullish price target above the stock’s ATH by using a measured move, also referred to by chartists as the measuring principle. This works by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s trendlines near the start of the pattern and adding that amount to the breakout point. In other words, we add $50 to $127, which projects a price target of $177. The forecast, around 34% above Tuesday’s close, indicates a potential area on the chart where investors may be happy to lock in profits.

Melody Heald Some life hacks are just game-changing. Like this more efficient way to grate cheese. Or how to get a new tire for free. A customer thinks she just discovered one of these game-changing hacks while shopping online at Frito-Lay. “All right, tell me if this was a thing because up until a few days ago, I did not [know about this],” TikTok user Sammie (@sammie.sells) starts in her video. Sammie continues, explaining she and her family buy the variety boxes of chips at Sam’s Club and Costco. “But I always feel like we don’t always eat all the Cheetos. We don’t always eat all the Fritos. Like, we can never find a good mix of them,” she says. She came across a solution to this problem. “Did you know you can make your own box on the Frito-Lay website?” the content creator asks. Sammie flips the camera, showing off the box of chips she customized. “Look at this! I got to pick all of them out. None of this will go to waste because we will eat all this,” she says. Normally, a 30-chip variety pack is $20 at Sam’s Club. Ordering a custom variety pack online does a little extra. But for Sammie, those extra bucks are worth it. “It’s, like, $25 with shipping. It got here in three days,” she says. “I’m never buying chips from Sam’s or Costco again,” she concludes. The Daily Dot reached out to Sammie via TikTok comment and direct message. Her video has amassed 1.3 million views. Consequently, after watching Sammie’s video, some viewers rushed to the Frito-Lay website. Others said the price of the customizable box just wasn’t worth it for them. “How I need to try this,” one stated. “This is amazing if I’m able to order what I like.” “Raise your hand if you just learned you don’t have ‘build your own potato chip box’ money,” a second remarked. “Yep…but the cost is crazy compared to the grocery store,” a third shared. In a follow-up video, Sammie demonstrates how to order your own variety box through. First, she clicks on “snacks.com.” “You’re gonna click on the link, and it’ll take you here,” she says. “This screen will have all the chips that are in stock. You can put all the same ones or make it a variety pack.” After the content creator selects her 30, she scrolls to the bottom, and hits “view box,” “add to cart,” and “proceed to checkout.” Sammie also addresses viewer concerns about the cost of the product. “I understand it’s not cheaper. My whole thing is it gives me the chips that I want, and none of them go to waste,” she clarifies. In 2020, Frito-Lay gave customers the ability to create their own variety packs after discovering that two out of three customers were willing to pay for it. “Since we launched Snacks.com earlier this year, we’ve seen it resonate with consumers, and our team has uncovered insights to continue giving our consumers more of what they want,” Michael Lindsey, Chief Transformation and Strategy Officer, Frito-Lay North America said on the company’s website. “Our ability to own the end-to-end value chain enables us to deliver customized offerings like ‘Make Your Own Variety Pack’ to create a more personalized snacking experience.” The Daily Dot reached out to Frito-Lay via email.

Title: Dicker Data Limited (ASX:DDR) insiders seem bullish, own 55% and have been buying more recently

Time Published: 2024-10-16T00:40:32Z
Full Content:
Dicker Data's significant insider ownership suggests inherent interests in company's expansion The top 2 shareholders own 54% of the company Insiders have been buying lately Every investor in Dicker Data Limited (ASX:DDR) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 55% stake, individual insiders possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). It's interesting to note that insiders have been buying shares recently. This could signal that stock prices could go up and insiders are here for it. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Dicker Data. See our latest analysis for Dicker Data Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Dicker Data does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Dicker Data's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Dicker Data is not owned by hedge funds. Our data suggests that Fiona Brown, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 31%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. David Dicker is the second largest shareholder owning 23% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 1.9% of the company stock. Interestingly, the second-largest shareholder, David Dicker is also Chief Executive Officer, again, pointing towards strong insider ownership amongst the company's top shareholders. A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 54% stake. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. It seems that insiders own more than half the Dicker Data Limited stock. This gives them a lot of power. Given it has a market cap of AU$1.7b, that means insiders have a whopping AU$943m worth of shares in their own names. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to discover if they have been buying or selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 38% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Dicker Data is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...

Companies that have not adapted are lagging behind, while those with the foresight to join the trend are experiencing exponential growth. Nvidia is among the latter, having made an early entry into a rapidly expanding segment. Now, Nvidia is about to claim once again the title of the most valuable company in the world. This is not the first time that Nvidia has achieved such a milestone. The company had already managed to surpass big names in the industry, such as Apple and Microsoft. However, this victory was fleeting, as both Apple and Microsoft eventually overtook it once more. Now, a recent surge in Nvidia shares to an all-time high of $138.07 could soon turn the tables. Following the recent rise in Nvidia shares, the company also surpasses another milestone: reaching a market capitalization of around $3.4 trillion. This also makes it one of only three companies to have surpassed this valuation. Currently, only Apple surpasses it with a market cap of $3.55 trillion. The AI boom began with the availability of the ChatGPT preview version. The chatbot’s impressive “reasoning” capabilities led the entire industry to turn its attention to artificial intelligence. Well, Nvidia was there from the start, as the service ran on the company’s hardware. Since then, all major companies that have wanted to catch up in the segment have turned to the company’s AI chips. The list includes Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon. Nvidia quickly positioned itself as the leading supplier of AI hardware. As a result, the company’s stock shows an incredible growth of 2,800.6% over the past five years. Furthermore, 2024 brought a year-over-year growth of the stock price by 186.6%. The growth trend is not expected to stop, as companies demand increasingly powerful and efficient AI hardware. Currently, Nvidia is working on the next generation of AI chips, known as “Blackwell.” The brand publicly stated that the current lawsuit by Blackwell is “insane,” so they expect to receive billions of dollars in revenue by the end of this year alone.

Title: Alphabet VP Amie Thuener sells $473,929 in company stock
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/insider-trading-news/alphabet-vp-amie-thuener-sells-473929-in-company-stock-93CH-3664792
Time Published: 2024-10-15T21:34:58Z
Full Content:
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently disclosed that Amie Thuener O'Toole, the company's Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, sold shares of the company's Class C Capital Stock. According to the SEC filing, Thuener sold a total of 2,834 shares at a price of $167.23 per share, amounting to a total transaction value of $473,929. Following this sale, Thuener holds 26,349 shares of Class C Capital Stock. The transactions were executed under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows company insiders to set up a predetermined schedule for selling stocks, thereby helping to avoid any potential accusations of insider trading. This plan was adopted by Thuener on May 31, 2024. In addition to Class C Capital Stock, Thuener also holds 8,940 shares of Class A Common Stock and 13,806 shares of Class C Google Stock Units, with vesting schedules detailed in the filing. In other recent news, Google, an Alphabet Inc. company, has been actively involved in significant legal and business developments. Google has sought to delay the enforcement of a court order mandating changes to its Play Store operations, following an antitrust lawsuit by Epic Games. The company believes the injunction could introduce substantial safety, security, and privacy risks into the Android ecosystem. Google has also struck a deal with Kairos Power to procure electricity from small modular reactors (SMRs), marking a significant step towards fulfilling the increasing energy demands of Google's artificial intelligence operations. This deal is set to bring Kairos' inaugural SMR online by 2030. Meanwhile, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is preparing to reveal its much-anticipated robotaxi at a Hollywood event. The company plans to create a fleet of self-driving taxis, available to passengers via an app. Tesla owners could also earn income by enlisting their vehicles in the service. The company's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software is expected to play a key role in the robotaxi service. In another development, tech giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have proposed an alternative power payment plan for data centers in Ohio. This proposal comes in response to utility company AEP Ohio's plan for pre-payments and financial assurances to cover significant energy usage by data centers and cryptocurrency miners. The tech companies' counter-proposal aims to establish a fair framework for power payment that accommodates the growing energy needs of data centers while addressing utility companies' concerns. To provide additional context to Amie Thuener O'Toole's recent stock sale, it's worth examining Alphabet's current financial position and market performance. According to InvestingPro data, Alphabet boasts a substantial market capitalization of $2.04 trillion, underscoring its position as one of the world's most valuable companies. The company's P/E ratio stands at 23.64, which, when considered alongside an InvestingPro Tip noting that Alphabet is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth," suggests the stock may be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. This could provide insight into why insiders might choose to retain significant holdings despite periodic sales. Alphabet's financial health appears robust, with another InvestingPro Tip highlighting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet." This strong liquidity position is further supported by the fact that Alphabet's "liquid assets exceed short term obligations," indicating financial stability that may reassure investors in light of insider transactions. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 reached $328.28 billion, with a notable revenue growth of 13.38% over the same period. This growth trajectory aligns with Alphabet's status as a "prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry," as noted in an additional InvestingPro Tip. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers over 10 additional tips for Alphabet, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market outlook.

Title: Walgreens plans to close 1,200 stores; its stock price sees a double-digit jump
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-plans-close-1-200-212916071.html
Time Published: 2024-10-15T21:29:16Z
Full Content:
Walgreens plans to close about 1,200 stores over the next three years in an effort to improve earnings and increase cash flow, the struggling company announced Tuesday. The downsizing plan by Walgreens Boots Alliance will target 500 stores during the current fiscal year, which began on Sept. 1, and comes months after Chief Executive Tim Wentworth acknowledged that about a quarter of the company’s 8,600 U.S. stores were underperforming. The company did not specify which stores will close but said it will prioritize underperforming locations owned by the company or at which the lease is expiring. Only stores in the U.S. will be affected. Walgreens Boots Alliance also owns the Boots pharmacy chain in the United Kingdom. Wentworth told analysts Tuesday that about 6,000 Walgreens locations remain profitable, according to the Associated Press. The company operates more than 580 stores in California, second only to Florida. The closures announced Tuesday include 300 already approved under a previous cost-cutting plan. Walgreens is not alone in its woes — competitors Rite Aid and CVS have also been forced to reconsider their footprints and close locations amid challenging times for the industry. Rite Aid has closed more than 200 stores since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2023. Read more: 'My kids go to Costco now,' and other reasons Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS are hurting On the retail side, chain pharmacies are facing heavy competition from giants such as Amazon and Walmart, while a drop in consumer spending and an increase in theft have continued to eat into profits, analysts said. On the pharmaceutical side, they’re seeing tighter margins because of lower reimbursement rates for the drugs they sell to customers. Much of the pharmacy pinch is rooted in the companies’ dependence on intermediaries called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, that have significant control over how much pharmacies get reimbursed for the drugs they sell to customers. Two of the largest benefit management companies, OptumRX and Caremark, are owned by insurance companies that have been looking to cut costs by pushing down reimbursement rates, which has punished the pharmacies’ bottom lines. Chain pharmacies are also operating in an overcrowded environment, said Raymond James healthcare analyst John Ransom. Partly because of a real estate binge in the 1990s, urban communities are dotted with an excess of pharmacies, he said. “Like most retailers, we have been facing a challenging operating environment,” Walgreens external communications manager Samantha Stansberry said in August. “These factors have resulted in a growing number of store closures across the country as we invest in our other locations to deliver a consistent customer experience.” Read more: Walgreens woes continue with earnings miss, guidance cut and plans to shutter more stores The plan to close stores was announced as part of the company's release of its fourth-quarter and end-of-year financial reports, which underscored its dire straits. For fiscal year 2024, which ended Aug. 31, Walgreens posted a net loss of $8.6 billion, up 180% from the previous year. Total revenue for the company rose about 6% for the year to $147.7 billion. Investors reacted positively to Walgreens' cost-saving strategy, driving up shares in the company nearly 16% on Tuesday to $10.42. The rise, however, still left the stock down more than 61% so far this year. “Fiscal 2025 will be an important rebasing year as we advance our strategy to drive value creation,” Wentworth said in a news release detailing fourth-quarter and full-year financial results. “This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term.” Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

Title: Jim Cramer on Netflix, Inc. (NFLX): ‘The Street’s Been All Over The Place On This One’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-netflix-inc-nflx-192509466.html
Time Published: 2024-10-15T19:25:09Z
Full Content:
We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer is Talking About These 14 Stocks Before Earnings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about before earnings. As earnings season kicks off, Jim Cramer of Mad Money offered insights on what investors should watch in the coming week on Wall Street. He highlighted the anticipated reports from several major banks, along with a few other companies, as key events to monitor. Cramer expressed optimism about the current market conditions, noting that the situation aligns with his previous predictions that the market would thrive once the Federal Reserve began reducing interest rates while the economy remained strong. He remarked on the spectacular earnings reported by some major banks on Friday, emphasizing that this positive news is particularly impactful now, as opposed to previous instances when the Fed was tightening, causing good news to go largely unnoticed. Cramer believes that with the Fed now supportive of the market, there is potential for more favorable times ahead. Looking to Monday, Cramer predicted that the focus will shift away from earnings reports due to other significant developments over the weekend. He mentioned the anticipated unveiling of a Chinese stimulus package and noted that although the rally in China has stalled, it could regain momentum if the Chinese government injects substantial funds into real estate and the stock market. “Now, on Monday, we won't be focused on earnings. There's a lot of other stuff happening over the weekend. For instance, I think we'll be parsing the Chinese stimulus package that's going to be unveiled. The China rally is stalled, but it can get rolling again if the Chinese Communist Party keeps throwing tens of billions of dollars for the stimulus at real estate, at the stock market.” Cramer warned that the financial sector will face a significant test on Tuesday, as different banks will be reporting their earnings. Cramer reminded investors that we are just at the beginning of one of the year's four reporting periods, which can be chaotic and open to various interpretations. “We’re at the beginning of one of the year’s four reporting periods,” he said. “They’re jumbled. They’re open to a lot of interpretation. They’re fast. So listen to the calls, ponder a moment, and only then should you pull the trigger.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that are slated to release earnings this week and were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 11. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103 Cramer has been bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) for some time. During Friday’s episode, he posited his opinion that the company will report good news. “We get results from Netflix and the Street's been all over the place on this one. I think it'll be good, thanks to the new ad tier. And they're about to release Squid Game 2. I'm told it's going to be a guaranteed worldwide blockbuster, could bring in new subscribers from around the globe.” Jim Cramer recently voiced his disagreement with Barclays’ pessimistic view that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) would struggle to meet its revenue estimates. Cramer pointed out that the growth of the company’s advertising business, combined with new revenue streams from paid sharing plans, has provided the company with greater flexibility in achieving its revenue goals. He noted that starting next year, the streaming giant will no longer report quarterly subscriber figures, allowing a shift in focus solely to revenue expectations, which he believes is the crucial new metric. Cramer also highlighted Piper Sandler's position that even if Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) cannot maintain the same margin expansions as in the past year, it can still achieve steady growth. He expressed agreement with this perspective, suggesting that it shows a realistic approach to the company's potential. What truly matters, according to Cramer, is whether the company meets its financial targets. If the company continues to outperform earnings expectations, as it has done in 10 of the last 12 quarters, then concerns about its valuation become less relevant, as the stock price will appear more attractive in hindsight. Conversely, if it fails to deliver on its numbers, there would be little justification for a high stock price, which could lead to a decline. Cramer believes the company deserves the benefit of the doubt, which is why he maintains a bullish stance on the stock. He remarked that the bear thesis seems overly speculative and not firmly grounded in current realities. It should be noted that this year, the company reached a significant milestone by exceeding 40 million members in its ad-supported tier. The company announced a 17% increase in revenue for the second quarter, along with a 17% growth in its paid streaming memberships from the prior year, which have now reached a total of 278 million. Overall NFLX ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is talking about before earnings. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Is Nvidia Stock Down 5%? Blame A Dutch Firm’s ‘Technical Error’

Fresh off of a record closing high, Nvidia stock slid Tuesday as part of a semiconductor chip stock slump with an unusual impetus: A less-than-stellar earnings release from a Dutch company which accidentally came out earlier than expected. Nvidia stock struggled Tuesday. Nvidia shares fell 4.5% in Tuesday trading, wiping out some $155 billion in market capitalization for the California firm, more than AT&T’s $154 billion total market value. Nvidia stock had its steepest daily loss since Sept. 3’s 10% dip, which marked the largest erosion of one company’s market cap in a single day in history at $279 billion. Shares of several other firms involved in designing and manufacturing the semiconductor technology powering the generative AI explosion also tumbled, with Advanced Micro Devices, Arm Holdings and Broadcom stocks sliding at least 3.5%. The stateside chip stock dip came after Dutch firm ASML, which makes much of the equipment used to make the high-tech AI chips and works closely with Nvidia, reported earnings a day earlier than expected due to what the company attributed to a “technical error.” The unanticipated release included a warning of “more gradual” growth for ASML, which said it expects 2025 revenues to come in between $32.7 billion to $38.1 billion, well below consensus analyst forecasts of $39.1. New York-listed American depository receipts of ASML stock lost 17.5% during Tuesday trading, the worst loss since March 2020 and the second-worst day of the last decade for the stock. With a $3.2 trillion market cap, Nvidia remains the second-largest company in the world, trailing only the $3.5 trillion iPhone maker Apple, which hit its highest ever share price Tuesday morning. After finishing 2023 as the S&P 500 index’s best-performing stock with a blistering 239% gain, Nvidia is again the biggest winner so far in 2024, gaining 167%. The surge comes as Nvidia reports exponential earnings growth thanks to “insane” demand for its graphics processing units, the semiconductor technology which powers generative AI applications at companies like Meta and Tesla. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO since he cofounded the company in 1993, is the world’s 11th-richest person thanks to his 3.5% stake in Nvidia, according to Forbes’ estimates. Huang’s net worth fell $5 billion due to Tuesday’s dip. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Shares of semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) fell 9.7% in the afternoon session as semiconductor stocks fell after ASML, the biggest supplier of equipment used in making advanced chips, pre-announced weak earnings. ASML expects fiscal year 2025 sales to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros, at the lower half of the range it had previously provided. Similarly, bookings for the quarter are reportedly below expectations. Reuters noted that the quarterly earnings numbers were mistakenly published a day earlier than expected. Management noted that while the potential in the AI (artificial intelligence) market remained strong, other markets were taking too long to recover, with the observed trend expected to continue into 2025. Lastly, CFO Roger Dassen projected China's contribution to overall revenue to be around 20% (down from the recent estimate of 49%), hinting at potential weakness in the region. ASML's technology is used by chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Samsung to make advanced chips, including those specially designed for AI workloads. Given the company's (ASML) critical role in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the weak earnings and outlook could signal a possible softening in the industry. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Lam Research? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Lam Research’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 19 days ago when the stock gained 7.5% as semiconductor stocks, especially the memory chip manufacturers, surged after Micron reported impressive fourth-quarter earnings results. Micron beat across most of the key metrics we track, including revenue, operating profit, and EPS. Notably, the company recorded a whopping 93% revenue growth compared to the previous year, showing that the AI party is still ongoing. Micron attributed the outperformance to the growing demand for memory chips that power generative AI applications. Looking ahead, Micron provided strong sales and profitability guidance for the next quarter, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Overall, the result highlights the abundant growth opportunities for chip makers with technologies to accelerate the booming AI trend. Lam Research is up 3.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $77.41 per share, it is still trading 31.3% below its 52-week high of $112.73 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Lam Research’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,198. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Dow and Nasdaq slump as ASML leads a chip stock rout

The Dow and other major indexes experienced losses Tuesday afternoon as chipmakers struggled amid news of potential export caps. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 118 points, or 0.28%, to 42,939. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 shed 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Shares of Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML (ASML+3.17%) plummeted following the company’s disappointing third-quarter bookings and a downward revision of its 2025 guidance. During afternoon trading, ASML’s stock dropped by more than 16%, reflecting investors’ concerns about the company’s outlook. “While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover,” CEO Christophe Fouquet said in the company’s earnings report. “It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected.” ASML is the only company in the world that makes the equipment needed for advanced chip manufacturing, and nearly half of ASML’s revenue for the second quarter came from sales to China. However, due to export restrictions from the U.S. and the Netherlands, the company is now facing a more challenging business outlook in China. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA+0.77%) fell over 5% Tuesday, a day after after closing at a record high. The chipmaker’s stock was down less than 1% in pre-market trading, but had fallen by about 5% by midday. The drop occurred following a report that the U.S. could cap sales of advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S.-based chipmakers to certain countries. Biden administration officials in recent weeks have discussed putting a ceiling on export licenses for advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD-0.19%), to countries in the Middle East, citing national security concerns, Bloomberg reported. Among major semiconductor stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-0.19%) fell by 4.9%, Micron Technology (MU-0.81%) declined by 3.5%, and Broadcom (AVGO-0.91%) decreased by 3.5% on Tuesday. –Britney Nguyen contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: New One Piece, Naruto Games Reportedly Canceled by Bandai Namco

Bandai Namco games involving One Piece, Naruto, and more are supposedly in jeopardy. By Tanner Dedmon Some unannounced games in the worlds of One Piece and Naruto have supposedly been either paused or canceled entirely amid some larger shakeups at Bandai Namco, according to new reports. It’s been suggested that work on these unknown games is uncertain at the moment due to a underwhelming demand, and the games in flux apparently extend beyond anime titles, too, with a Nintendo project currently on hold at Bandai Namco as well. News of the state of these Naruto and One Piece games supposedly in the works over at Bandai Namco comes from Bloomberg which said that the publisher had either halted or canceled some of its projects. Bloomberg speaks of a “lackluster demand,” though it seems the demand here is referring more to games in general as the gaming industry continues to cut costs by canceling projects and laying off workers. There were no references made to a lack of demand for Naruto and One Piece, specifically, which makes sense given that the latter is more popular than ever after Netflix’s live-action Naruto series even if the franchise is currently going on a hiatus. That does made it even stranger that Bandai Namco would be reconsidering a One Piece game, however, given its popularity and the fact that we’ve gotten several One Piece games in the last four years. Bandai Namco publishes tons of anime-themed games — pretty much any of the more modern ones that you can think of — so there’s no telling what kinds of games these One Piece and Naruto projects were. Many of Bandai Namco’s anime games are arena fighters like the wonderful Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero while others are a bit more open like Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, but they all typically circle back around to beating up anime baddies. But while anime adaptations may be the publisher’s bread and butter, its work extends beyond that scope as well. Bandai Namco published Elden Ring and other Souls games, for example, and also works with Nintendo on some projects. Two Nintendo franchises Bandai Namco works on are the Mario Kart and Smash Bros. games with a broader team established recently to work closer with Nintendo (though those franchises were not specifically mentioned in the announcement). Mobile games are another focus of Bandai Namco which are also supposedly being impacted by these decisions made internally. Another game, Blue Protocol, was recently confirmed for a shutdown early next year despite having only just released recently. The Western version of the game which was to be published by Amazon has also been canned. As a result of these cancelations and paused games, Bandai Namco is also reducing its workforce with around 200 employees said to be affected. These employee losses also contribute to an already brutal year for gaming studios in terms of layoffs and lost talent.

Title: Alibaba Still Has Room to Run: How China’s Stimulus Drives Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2024/10/15/alibaba-still-has-room-to-run-how-chinas-stimulus-drives-growth/

By Muslim Farooque Summary Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba (BABA, Financial) has been on a superb run over the past six months, gaining upwards of 49% in value. After a sluggish phase from late 2020 through 2023, Alibaba stock is finally hitting its stride, showcasing healthy momentum as it climbs back to its pre-pandemic highs. Naturally, with its impressive rally, many are concerned about whether Alibaba stock has run too far. Given the tailwinds in play, spearheaded by the likely boost from China's massive stimulus plan, there still appears to be significant growth potential for the stock ahead. The dramatic shifts in China's monetary policy of late, led by unexpected interest rate cuts and a dovish stance, have fueled a superb rally in Chinese equities. Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People's Bank of China, announced sweeping economic measures, including reducing the 7-day reverse repo rate from 1.7% to 1.5%. With a firmer commitment to rejuvenating China's economic landscape, Chinese stocks have been running hot of late. In fact, Chinese stocks recorded their highest gains since 2008 in the past couple of weeks. The SPDR S&P China ETF (GXC SPDR S&P China ETF ), for instance, has outperformed the S&P 500 by a sizeable margin. Over the past month, GXC stock has climbed more than 20%, comfortably beating the S&P 500's gain, showcasing its sustained bullish momentum in response to the economic stimulus. Consequently, analysts are finally bullish on Chinese stocks. David Chao of Invesco Asset and Raymond Chen from ZiZhou Investment Asset Management expects strong fiscal measures to sustain the rally. Additionally, Laura Wang of Morgan Stanley sees a potential 10% short-term gain for the CSI 300 Index, indicating a marked shift in market sentiment, primarily due to the recent economic stimulus. Since November 2020, when the Chinese government initiated a rigorous regulatory crackdown on major tech companies, Chinese tech stocks have been suppressed. Following the high-profile suspension of Ant Group's IPO, the landscape from 2020 to 2023 marked a major cooling period for the sector, marked by a focus on antitrust, data security, and financial regulations. However, the recent economic changes aimed at stabilizing the Chinese property industry signal a pivotal shift. These interventions will likely alleviate major economic pressures, boost business conditions, and increase consumer spending power. Moreover, as we head toward late 2024, the strategic focus on economic revitalization could potentially lead to superb gains for Chinese stocks, especially Alibaba. It's important to note that from September 2014 to January 2020, Alibaba stock experienced a remarkable rise of 122%, hitting a high of $231. This period marked a golden era of growth for Chinese tech, supported by expansionary supportive government policies. Alibaba has quickly become one of the top AI players, arguably the biggest long-term catalyst in driving the company's growth and enhancing its global footing. Through its Qwen AI model, it has cemented its position as one of the giants in the international AI landscape, going head-to-head with top models like OpenAI's GPT and others. Furthermore, the tech giant's recent partnerships with industry bellwethers like Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) and Mastercard (MA, Financial) showcase its AI-powered capabilities, including autonomous mobility. The integration of its AI model with Nvidia's Drive AGX Orin platform, perhaps one of the most promising future sectors, bolsters its appeal as an AI play. Also, Qwen's link to AliAlibaba's own mammoth platforms like Taobao and DingTalk, each with north of 600 million active users, underscores the powerful, robust infrastructure Alibaba has built to support its AI-driven services. Most recently, the company released more than 100 open-source AI models, having released its powerful text-to-video tool at its Apsara Cloud event. Also, a potential partnership with Apple to integrate AI adds new layers to Alibaba's growth story, fortifying its credentials in the niche. Hence, the company's comprehensive AI strategy isn't just about its current operations but is also strategically positioning it for substantial future growth. Despite some inconsistency in top-line growth over the past few years, Alibaba's robust profitability numbers continue to impress. Alibaba Profitability Rank As depicted in the visual, Alibaba attracts a superb 8 on 10 rating from GuruFocus, underscoring its robust bottom-line health compared to sector benchmarks. Starting with its gross margin stands at an impressive 37.9%, highlighting its ability to maintain healthy profits relative to sales. Moreover, its operating margin is solid at 12.12%, indicating efficient management operations despite operating in a competitive landscape. However, its net margin stands at 7.36% while its ROA is at 3.9%, suggesting that while Alibaba is profitable, there are areas where it needs to step up its game with regard to efficiency in turning assets into net income. Also, its FCF margin of 18% is commendable, reflecting robust cash generation capabilities that remain critical in sustaining operations and funding future expansions. Moreover, Alibaba's ROC ( Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio)) is at 57.3%, dramatically outperforming many of its competitors, highlighting its effectiveness in generating returns from capital investments. Additionally, with 10 consecutive years of profitability, Alibaba's financial stability has shielded it from previous crises, positioning it to thrive in the competitive landscape. A huge part of Alibaba's margin growth has been the expansion of its Cloud business, which is emerging as a key growth engine for Alibaba. Despite a challenging retail environment in China and a brief dip in cloud sales last year, the integration of advanced AI technologies has revitalized this segment, driving a strong rebound in recent results. Alibaba Cloud Revenue From the chart above we can see that Alibaba Cloud has shown impressive growth over the years, as shown by its revenue trajectory from 2018 to 2023. Despite a sizeable dip in 2023, the cloud division's rapid expansion from $2,135 million in 2018 to a peak of $11,763 million in 2022 highlights its expanding influence within Alibaba. Moreover, as per recent financials, Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Group contributes significantly to sales, which accounts for 11.3% of the pie, underscoring the cloud sector's expanding influence. Alibaba Income Statement Breakdown Chart Also, from the graphic above, it's clear that the company draws sales from an array of sources. Though it still generates the lion's share of sales from Taobao and Tmall Group at 46.2%, other segments collectively contribute over 30%, which is imperative in stabilizing the company's financials against sector-specific downturns while helping to capitalize on multiple growth avenues. In its most recent showing in Q2 2024, Alibaba Cloud grew superbly, with segment-wise revenue reaching $3.64 billion, marking a 6% increase YOY. This growth is propelled by AI-driven products, reflecting a powerful demand in the AI sector, which Alibaba is tapping into. Also, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu emphasized the pervasive impact of AI on the cloud division's future, projecting double-digit growth in the latter half of 2024. Hence, the substantial investments in AI and cloud infrastructure that Alibaba has been making signal its intent to accelerate this momentum, ensuring its competitive edge in a fast-evolving digital landscape. Alibaba's stock performance has demonstrated superb gains over the past year, with stellar gains across various timeframes. Over the past month and three months, Alibaba has achieved healthy returns of more than 27% and 47%, respectively, outpacing its competition in PDD and MELI over the short term. Despite the challenges over the past three to five years, the tailwinds propelling Alibaba suggest it is positioned excellently to maintain its growth and continue delivering substantial returns for its investors. Alibaba Annualized Return Comparison Table Furthermore, based on the 12-month price target chart for Alibaba points to a consensus target of $108.40, with a potential increase of 2.15%. It's important to note that projections range significantly, with a $146 high estimate and a low of $79.70. Despite the volatility expected in Alibaba stock, I expect favorable market tailwinds to continue driving more upside as optimism in Chinese equities continues moving from strength to strength. Alibaba Analyst Price Targets Furthermore, if we look at the value of Alibaba stock based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, we see that there's still plenty of upside left in the stock. The DCF analysis is based on the company's TTM free cash flow (FCF) per share, projecting a fair value of $146.07, which is significantly above the current stock price. This indicates a margin of safety of more than 26%. Additionally, the model includes key variables including a 10% discount rate, reflecting the risk and time value of money. Also, the analysis is broken down into the growth and terminal stages. For the growth stage, a 10-year period is assumed with an annual growth rate of 8.3%, which amounts to a growth value of $86.28. For the terminal stage, also spanning 10 years, a lower growth rate of 4% results in a terminal value of $59.8. Given the sizeable margin of safety, there is hefty opportunity for capital appreciation, which shows that Alibaba stock's current price may not fully reflect its future cash flow potential, making it an attractive value investment. Alibaba DCF Model Chart Despite the run-up in value, I expect Alibaba stock to continue rising in value on the back of multiple tailwinds. Perhaps the biggest boost the stock is centered around China's economic stimulus measures, that led to a broader rally in Chinese equities. Moreover, Alibaba's inroads in the AI realm and cloud business expansion bolster its growth prospects further. Also, despite past challenges, Alibaba will likely continue sustaining its momentum with key drivers like cloud growth, AI innovations, and higher consumer spending. Also, a DCF analysis based on realistic assumptions points to a fair value of $146.07, implying a strong margin of safety and capital appreciation potential.

Title: Apple Stock Rises To All-Time High—And Record $3.6 Trillion Market Cap
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/15/apple-stock-rises-to-all-time-high-and-record-36-trillion-market-cap/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T15:13:19Z
Full Content:
The world’s largest company got even bigger Tuesday, as Apple set a new record share price as the Silicon Valley titan enjoys an extended bump from the release of the artificial intelligence-forward iPhone 16. Pedestrians pass an Apple store in Shanghai over the weekend. Shares of Apple rose as much as 2.7%, setting a new intraday record of $237.49. It’s the first time in exactly three months Apple stock hit an all-time high. Though the stock pared gains slightly to 1.7% by 11 a.m. EDT, trading at $235.33 per share, it’s still on track to break the July 16 record close of $234.82. Apple’s market capitalization rose to as high as $3.61 trillion, the highest valuation ever recorded by a public company, breaking its own July record. There was no singular major catalyst driving up Apple’s share price, and it certainly wasn’t a product of a broader big tech rally, as shares of fellow trillion-dollar West Coast firms Nvidia (-4.4%), Microsoft (-0.4%), Alphabet (up 0.1%), Amazon (-1.3%) and Meta (-1.3%) largely struggled. It was likely a continuation of continued optimism from analyst supply checks on the iPhone 16 released last month to Wall Street concerns about global demand. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said iPhone lead times, a proxy for the smartphone demand, are “encouraging” and the 56 million iPhones shipped last month was about 10% higher than expected, indicating about $2.5 billion in marginal quarterly revenue upside. Apple also announced Tuesday its first new iPad Mini tablet since 2021, a model emphasizing AI applications. A pair of major events will come later this month: The Oct. 28 launch of Apple Intelligence, the iPhone operating software focused on AI, and quarterly earnings after market close Oct. 31. Analysts expect the AI push from Apple will boost its financial performance, with analysts predicting record third-calendar-quarter revenues of $94 billion and net income of $24 billion.

Title: Netflix Stock: The Road To $1,000

MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA - 2024/10/14: A man takes photos with a camera facing a Netflix logo ... [+] inside a Mumbai studio hall. Netflix is an American streaming service that offers films, television series, and documentaries to its subscribers worldwide. (Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Could Netflix stock reach $1,000 in the coming years? We think there is a real possibility. How? Consider this, just about a year ago, at the end of October 2023, Netflix stock was trading at around $360 levels and the stock has gained over 95% and trades at about $710 per share currently. Looking at the valuations, Netflix’s valuation is about 60x based on trailing earnings and about 37x estimated 2024 earnings. Is this pricey? Not really, considering the company’s heady earnings growth and its deft strategy, which helped it navigate a brief subscriber decline post-Covid-19 while doubling down on initiatives such as paid sharing and ad-supported plans. That being said, Netflix’s stock performance has been anything but smooth over the last four years, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -51% in 2022, and 65% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In the scenario below, we use Netflix revenues, profit margins, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $1,000-plus stock price. Price Increases, Ad Plans Will Drive Revenue Growth Netflix revenues have expanded from levels of about $20.2 billion in 2019 to $33.7 billion in 2023, translating into a growth of about 14% annually and the momentum can hold up. Netflix is likely to see sales expand by about 15% this year to close to $39 billion. However, if Netflix grows its sales at an average annual rate of close to 20% for the next two years, sales could rise by almost 45% over the next two years. There are a couple of ways that Netflix could boost its revenue growth rates. Netflix’s ad-supported tier is enabling it to attract more price-sensitive customers with a price of just $7 per month in the U.S. This tier had a total of 40 million users as of mid-May 2024, up from about 23 million in January and Netflix has indicated that the ad-supported services represented about 40% of all its signups in the last quarter in markets where they are offered. The upside from ad-supported plans could be better still in developing markets, which Netflix has yet to penetrate and it could drive further growth. Moreover, despite the lower costs to the customer, the ad-supported plan is expected to generate more revenue per user than some of Netflix’s ad-free plans as incremental advertising revenue more than offsets the discount offered on the ad tier. Separately, Netflix has been hiking prices for its plans continuously in the U.S. and other developed markets. For perspective, the price of the Premium plan stood at $14 per month as of 2019 and rose steadily to $23 currently, following a series of price hikes, including a 15% hike last year. Further hikes are expected in 2025. Netflix could do something similar in international markets - where prices are often much lower than in the U.S. as it grows more confident about its value proposition. Separately, Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing is also likely to help it drive up its subscriber numbers to an extent. Strong Unit Economics Will Drive Margin Expansion Netflix is increasingly focused on boosting its margins, driven by economies of scale. Its net income margins, which stood at 9% in 2019, are guided to reach almost 23% in Q3 2024, as revenue growth outpaces operating costs. We think it’s possible that net margins could grow to around 30% in the next two years. A key advantage for Netflix is that its content costs are largely fixed, whether from in-house productions or licensing deals. As the company grows its subscriber base, these fixed costs are spread over more users, making content spending more efficient and allowing for a disproportionate boost to margins. Netflix’s push into advertising could also enhance its margins. The company’s in-house ad tech platform, which is expected to go live in 2025, could also make its advertising more efficient giving customers better insights, while attracting more brands, further boosting profitability. Netflix also has more room to raise its prices. While the company has boosted prices on its premium plan, it hasn’t increased the cost of its standard tier or ad-supported plan since early 2022. Combining about 45% revenue growth over the next two years, with a margin expansion to about 700 basis points from 23% this year to 30% by FY’26 (or up 30%), this would translate into net profit growth of almost 90%. Netflix Valuation Now, if earnings grow by 1.9x, the PE multiple will shrink by a similar level assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Netflix investors are betting will not happen. If earnings expand 1.9x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 37x presently to about 20x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 30x looks more likely. Why is that? Stronger growth and expanding margins will likely give investors more confidence about Netflix’s future, translating into a smaller contraction in its multiple. This effectively means that an earnings expansion of 1.9x, with a multiple contraction to 0.8x current levels would translate into a stock price appreciation of about 1.5x. This would make the growth of Netflix stock to levels of about $1,050 within the next few years a real possibility. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? While our above example illustrates a roughly two-year time frame, in practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three, as long as Netflix is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly.

Title: Walgreens Announces It Will Close 1,200 Stores Across US by 2027

Friends Read Free Pharmacy chain Walgreens announced it will shut down 1,200 stores across the United States over the next three years. Closures of Walgreens stores were announced in June, but the company had not disclosed the number of affected stores at that time. It had more than 8,000 stores in the United States as of Aug. 31 last year. “Our financial results in the fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 reflected our disciplined execution on cost management, working capital initiatives and capex reduction,” Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said in the statement. He said that in the next fiscal year, Walgreens will be “focusing on stabilizing the retail pharmacy by optimizing [the company’s] footprint, controlling operating costs, improving cash flow, and continuing to address reimbursement models to support dispensing margins and preserve patient access for the future.” “This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term,” said Wentworth, who was named chief executive officer in 2023. Walgreens, like its competitors, has been struggling for years with tight reimbursement for the prescriptions it sells as well as other challenges such as rising costs to operate its stores. Drugstore chains have also been dealing with more competition from online retail giant Amazon, as well as Walmart and Target. Rival CVS Health Corp. is wrapping up a three-year plan to close 900 stores. Another major chain, Rite Aid Corp., emerged from a bankruptcy reorganization earlier this year after whittling its store count down to about 1,300 locations. Walgreens has also been backing away from a plan to add primary care clinics next to some of its stores after launching an aggressive expansion under previous CEO Rosalind Brewer. Walgreens said Tuesday that its net loss swelled to more than $3 billion in the final quarter of 2024. The company said softer U.S. retail and pharmacy performance hurt operating income. It also booked some hefty charges tied to opioid litigation settlements the company had recognized in previous quarters and an equity investment in China. Walgreens shares rose by almost 4 percent on Tuesday morning before Wall Street’s opening bell. Earlier in October, CVS said it was cutting about 2,900 jobs across the United States as part of a cost-savings program, according to a statement. Those layoffs will mainly impact corporate jobs and will represent fewer than 1 percent of the company’s workforce. The reductions, part of CVS’s previously announced plan, would primarily impact corporate roles and not frontline jobs in stores, pharmacies, and distribution centers, it said.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Japanese video game developer seems to be the latest company not immune to undergoing layoffs and shuttering projects. By Lan Pitts on October 15, 2024 at 9:25AM PDT In a year flush with video-game-company layoffs and restructuring, Bandai Namco has reportedly canceled several titles including games featuring One Piece and Naruto licenses. In addition to those games, there was reportedly an unnamed contract project with Nintendo that has been shuttered as well. In a report by Bloomberg, coinciding with the projects being terminated, it's stated that the company is taking a traditional "Japanese approach to reduce staff and sending workers to rooms where they are given nothing to do, putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily” so they don't receive any form of severance. The method is commonly referred to as oidashibeya, meaning "expulsion room." The result has led to almost 100 resignations, but the company insists there is no such tactic in place. "Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation," a Bandai Namco representative said. "Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge." Over the summer, the company further shuttered its long-running Tales of the Rays mobile game and said it would take down its MMO game Blue Protoco starting in January. "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol," Bandai Namco said in a statement. "Both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world." Bandai Namcon's latest release, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero saw strong initial sales. The game, developed by Spike Chunsoft, sold more than 3 million units worldwide within its first 24 hours after its launch. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Title: Nvidia Stock Rise May Boost Its Value Past Apple’s To $3.9 Trillion

WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 27: NVIDIA founder, President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks about the ... [+] future of artificial intelligence and its effect on energy consumption and production at the Bipartisan Policy Center on September 27, 2024 in Washington, DC. Huang said that machine learning uses a large amount of energy but that artificial intelligence will save energy in the long run due to it's efficient computing abilities. Founded in California in 1993, NVIDIA is the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Nvidia could soon pass Apple as the world’s most valuable company. While Nvidia — which grew 122% in the second quarter — has been the leading economic beneficiary of demand for generative AI since 2023, Apple — whose top line increased 4.9% in Q2 — still scrambles for AI relevance. It may not be long before Nvidia’s superior innovation skills — which I described in my book, Brain Rush — could help propel the AI chip designer’s stock market capitalization ahead of Apple’s market cap. Nvidia appears poised to surpass Apple’s market cap as soon as next month. How so? Were Nvidia and Apple shares to keep rising at their respective 187% and 25% rates so far this year, the AI chip designer’s stock market capitalization would surpass Apple’s current $3.52 trillion next month — reaching $3.92 trillion, according to my estimates. Nvidia stock could keep rising. Were the stock to sustain its 187% growth for the next year (to Apple’s 25%), I estimate the AI chip designer could be worth $9.7 trillion by next October — more than twice Apple’s $4.4 trillion. Here are the forces that could propel Nvidia’s rise: To be sure, Nvidia does face headwinds. Its revenue growth rate — while high — is decelerating from 122% in Q2 to 8o% this quarter, according to my September Forbes post; companies are struggling to make AI payoff, noted the Boston Globe; and conflict in Taiwan could make it challenging for Nvidia’s manufacturing partner to produce chips. However, analysts are increasingly optimistic about Nvidia’s future potential. If you already own Nvidia stock, hold on. If not, there could be plenty of upside ahead. Nvidia got my attention in May 2023 after forecasting shockingly fast revenue growth during the company’s second-quarter report. Since then, Nvidia’s market capitalization has way more than doubled — adding about $2.4 trillion in the past 17 months. Cloud service providers’ demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units — driven by their desire to build and deploy AI chatbots — spurred me to write Brain Rush. While Nvidia’s revenue has “more than doubled in each of the past five quarters — and at least tripled in three of those periods,” according to CNBC, analysts expect the company’s expansion to slow to about 82% — and yield $32.9 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in October, according to London Stock Exchange Group. Nvidia has continued to push the edge of the GPU envelope — most recently launching the Blackwell chip. Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon are among the companies purchasing Nvidia’s GPUs “in massive quantities to build large clusters of computers for AI,” according to CNBC. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently described demand for Blackwell — the company’s next-generation AI GPU — as “insane” and the company “expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter,” noted CFO Colette Kress, in a report by TheStreet. The market for chips to build and operate AI chatbots is accelerating. Earlier this month, Advanced Micro Devices estimated the market for these AI accelerators was growing even faster than the company estimated last year. AMD guesses the market could reach $500 billion by 2028. That’s a 25% increase from the company’s prior forecast — and it represents 62% compound annual growth from 2023 when the market was valued at $45 billion, noted TheStreet. Nvidia controls a huge portion of that market. Analysts at Mizuho estimate Nvidia has a whopping 95% share of the market, CNBC reported. Why is Nvidia leading? “Nvidia benefits from its superior chip performance, strong scaling capabilities, and large installed base, which supports enterprises with multicloud strategies,” noted Citigroup analyst Atif Malik, according to TheStreet. As customers invest more capital in systems to build AI models, Nvidia’s share of that capital is rising. Recent events have made large companies more sanguine about investing in generative AI. OpenAI recently released an AI model with reasoning capabilities and Alphabet is also working on such a model. Moreover, Microsoft is expected to boost capital expenditures by about 33% to $58 billion, according to Bloomberg. Moreover, Nvidia’s recent optimism about Blackwell has relieved concerns for some investors. “There had been questions about the impact production delays could have, so these updates are reassuring,” Zehrid Osmani, portfolio manager at Martin Currie Investment Management, told Bloomberg. Indeed Blackwell orders are solid. Orders for the new chips “are booked out 12 months or so,” with “every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility,” noted Morgan Stanley analysts who met with management, according to Bloomberg. Reasoning-based AI could be a large new product category for Nvidia. “When you consider how compute-intensive it is, this could be a huge new product category,” said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, Bloomberg noted. Therefore, Nvidia could capture more of cloud services providers’ capital expenditures. By selling both its legacy Hopper GPUs and its new Blackwell platform, Nvidia’s share of that spending could rise. How so? Malik estimates Nvidia GPUs will grow 118% in 2024 and 84% in 2025 — giving the company 31% of all capital spending from U.S. cloud providers in 2024 and about a 35% share in 2025, TheStreet wrote. Demand for AI chips could continue as rivals fear being left behind. Companies building AI chatbots face “a Prisoner's Dilemma — each is individually incentivized to continue spending, as the costs of not doing so are devastating,” TD Cowen analysts wrote in an October 13 report, reported Reuters. Nvidia’s success is a result of innovation excellence. The company earns higher margins than rivals because its chips work better, it has the best engineers, its R&D produces a plethora of innovations, and its software for chip developers is unrivaled, according to my September Forbes post. Deploying those innovation skills, Nvidia will continue to upgrade its AI accelerators annually. In 2025, the company plans to announce its Blackwell Ultra chip and to introduce Rubin, a next-generation platform, in 2026, CNBC reported. What could go wrong for Nvidia? With such high investor expectations, Nvidia stock could plunge if the company does not beat revenue targets for the third quarter and raise guidance when it reports quarterly earnings next month. Global conflict in Taiwan could make it difficult for TSMC, Nvidia’s manufacturing partner, to produce chips as Yahoo! Finance noted. Such concerns did not stop one analyst from raising his price target for Nvidia to $150. On October 14, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari raised his price target for Nvidia by $15 arguing Nvidia would “likely benefit from the increasing complexity of AI workloads,” according to TheStreet.

Walgreens is closing more locations. Walgreens is closing approximately 1,200 locations as the drug store chain struggles to contend with online competitors and declining prescription drug payments. By 2027, about one in seven Walgreens currently open will close its doors. About 500 Walgreens will close its doors over the next year, the drug store chain announced Tuesday. Those closures represent a significant escalation from a few months ago, when the financially struggling company announced in June it was shutting 300 underperforming locations as part of a multi-year optimization program under CEO Tim Wentworth. At the time, the company had said about a quarter of Walgreens stores were unprofitable, and the chain promised "imminent" changes. Still, the company managed to post stronger-than-expected sales in the past quarter. Revenue at the chain rose 6% from the same quarter a year ago, but Walgreens reported a $3 billion loss largely because of a writedown of a Chinese pharmaceutical chain and a home care provider called CareCitrix. The latest tranche of closures is "emblematic of a company that is in trouble and is trying to course correct," according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. "Walgreens spent years building its business through acquisitions and neglected the fundamentals of its stores and its retail operations," he told CNN. "That has pushed a lot of outlets into a position where they are losing sales and are not generating a return." Shares of Walgreens rose nearly 4% in premarket trading. However, its stock is down nearly 70% for the year. The closures come amid a challenging time for drugstore chains, which are being hammered on a few fronts. Major drugstore chains, including CVS and Rite Aid, have struggled in recent years because of declining profits from filling prescriptions. They've declined because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and new competition from Amazon. Earlier this month, CVS announced it was cutting about 2,900 jobs as part of a $2 billion in cost savings initiative. The layoffs, which affect mostly corporate jobs, add to the 5,000 or so job reductions disclosed last year. The front-end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target, and even Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. In May, Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. CEO Wentworth said in a statement that the "turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term." For Saunders, Walgreens' eliminating the "dead wood will help the company strengthen its financials over time, but it is a huge admission of failure."

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high, challenges Apple as world's most valuable company

What just happened? There have been plenty of warnings recently that Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last 22 months is about to come to an abrupt end, but we're still not seeing any signs of it happening. Team Green's share price has just hit an all-time high as it looks set to once again take the title of world's most valuable company. Nvidia's share price has been climbing since January 2023, back when it was $14.86. The company provides an estimated 80% or more of the advanced GPU hardware used for training and running AI models, such as the A100 and H100 series. With the generative AI revolution in full swing, Nvidia stock is now at an all-time high of $138.07, an 829% increase over the last year and a half. The price rise means that Nvidia's market capitalization has now hit $3.39 trillion. That puts it in second place on the list of largest companies by market cap, above Microsoft's $3.12 trillion and just below leader Apple's $3.52 trillion. Nvidia will almost certainly unseat Apple as the world's most valuable company if the current trend continues. It wouldn't be the first time that Jensen Huang's firm has been in this position. In June, the company briefly overtook Apple and Microsoft at the top of the rich list. Courtesy of companiesmarketcap.com It was reported last week that overwhelming demand for Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPUs had led to a 12-month backlog. Companies such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google have purchased every Blackwell GPU, which includes the B200 GPU and GB200 Grace super chip, that Nvidia and its manufacturing partner TSMC can produce for the next four quarters. To help meet Blackwell demand, Nvidia is partnering with Foxconn to significantly boost availability. The Taiwanese manufacturer said it is constructing the largest GB200 production facility in the world in Guadalajara, Mexico. Nvidia will be relieved to see its stock price reach a record high, considering there were warnings that the AI bubble had burst last month. A report on the state of the manufacturing sector and claims (which it later denied) that Nvidia had received a subpoena from the Department of Justice as part of an antitrust probe wiped $279 billion off the company's market cap, the largest one-day drop in US history. But it didn't take long for the firm to recover. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Still, the company managed to post stronger-than-expected sales in the past quarter. Revenue at the chain rose 6% from the same quarter a year ago, but Walgreens reported a $3 billion loss largely because of a writedown of a Chinese pharmaceutical chain and a home care provider called CareCitrix. The latest tranche of closures is "emblematic of a company that is in trouble and is trying to course correct," according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. "Walgreens spent years building its business through acquisitions and neglected the fundamentals of its stores and its retail operations," he told CNN. "That has pushed a lot of outlets into a position where they are losing sales and are not generating a return." Shares of Walgreens (WBA) rose nearly 4% in premarket trading. However, its stock is down nearly 70% for the year. The closures come amid a challenging time for drugstore chains, which are being hammered on a few fronts. Major drugstore chains, including CVS and Rite Aid, have struggled in recent years because of declining profits from filling prescriptions. They've declined because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and new competition from Amazon. Earlier this month, CVS announced it was cutting about 2,900 jobs as part of a $2 billion in cost savings initiative. The layoffs, which affect mostly corporate jobs, add to the 5,000 or so job reductions disclosed last year. The front-end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target, and even Dollar General's growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. In May, Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. CEO Wentworth said in a statement that the "turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term." For Saunders, Walgreens' eliminating the "dead wood will help the company strengthen its financials over time, but it is a huge admission of failure."

Plus: Fintech App Trap: Enraged Customers Struggle To Cancel Their Subscriptions Good morning, Private equity is betting big on an unexpected place: Big Sky, Montana. In addition to the exclusive Yellowstone Club, which Forbes featured recently, Boston real estate investment firm CrossHarbor Capital made two acquisitions in 2013, eventually turning Big Sky Resort into one of the largest ski resorts in the country, with some 5,800 skiable acres. Altogether, CrossHarbor has spent at least $4 billion over the past 15 years, in a town with only 3,300 full-time residents. Big Sky saw rapid growth during Covid due to Montana’s relatively lenient restrictions and easy access to the outdoors, though it’s slowing down. Photo by Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images The S&P 500 notched another record Monday on the second anniversary of the bull market, and is just 2.3% shy of hitting 6,000. It’s a remarkable 68% gain from its low point in October 2022, as corporate earnings growth proved resilient despite high rates and inflation moderated from a four-decade high. Shares of Nvidia increased by more than 2% Monday, ending at a record close and encroaching on Apple’s standing as the world’s most valuable company. The company’s market valuation is now around $3.4 trillion, trailing Apple’s $3.5 trillion, as the chip giant’s shares are up 19% so far in October. Devin Nunes Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of former President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, spiked more than 18% Monday, adding more than $500 million to Trump’s net worth. Trump, who owns 57% of Trump Media shares, was worth $5.5 billion as of late Monday, according to Forbes’ Real Time Billionaires tracker. MORE: Even after its recent surge, Trump Media’s stock has been a disaster for many investors, but it’s enriched its CEO and former Congressman Devin Nunes. Since leaving the House of Representatives to take over Trump Media in January 2022, Forbes estimates that Nunes has raked in roughly more than $2 million in salary, $600,000 in cash bonuses, plus shares worth another $3.2 million. In total, Forbes estimates that Nunes has made about 13 times as much money running Trump’s tottering social media company than he would have if he had stayed in Congress. Getty Images Fertility startups have seen their ads about in-vitro fertilization and egg freezing blocked or restricted across TikTok, Google and Meta, according to leaders of multiple reproductive health companies. On the one hand, these giant platforms have valid reasons for their strict advertising rules, often stemming from the need to meet complex legal requirements of regulations in healthcare and medicine, as well as user safety and privacy laws. But some companies and brands in the space see these decisions as censorship—in a post-Roe v. Wade era, even topics like fertility care have become politicized. ChatGPT maker OpenAI is working with Carahsoft, a billionaire-owned government contractor that helps tech companies provide their software to the Pentagon, giving it a path to defense contracts. But the government contractor was recently accused of price-fixing on Department of Defense contracts. A majority of economists believe Vice President Kamala Harris’ proposed economic policies would lead to lower inflation than those of former President Donald Trump, according to a new survey published by the Wall Street Journal, though voters are far more split on who would best handle inflation. Perhaps the most notable and potentially inflationary policies from Trump are his proposed tariffs of 60% on Chinese goods and 10% on other imports, while Harris’ economic proposals include $6,000 child tax credits and $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time home buyers. Both presidential candidates have rolled out a variety of tax proposals in the leadup to the election: Harris’ proposals include expanding the child tax credit, providing tax credits for first-time home buyers and developers building affordable housing, and increasing taxes on corporations. Meanwhile, Trump recently said he would end double taxation on Americans living abroad and allow interest on car loans to be tax deductible. Illustration by Cecilia Runxi Zhang for Forbes; Photo by Rawf8Getty Images TOPLINE TomoCredit, a six-year-old San Francisco startup backed by investors including Morgan Stanley and Mastercard, promises to boost consumers’ credit scores by, among other things, helping them report additional on-time payments to the credit bureaus. But along with other startups, it’s also the target of hundreds of online complaints. Tomo CEO Kristy Kim says the company has about 100,000 paying subscribers. And over the past year, consumers have filed 557 complaints to the Better Business Bureau about the startup. To put that level of customer dissatisfaction in perspective, PNC Bank, the sixth largest bank in America with more than 10 million customers, received 599 Better Business Bureau complaints over the same year. Most of the complaints against Tomo filed in August and September cited problems with canceling the service. To be fair, the hard-to-cancel problem isn’t unique to fintechs. In March 2023, the FTC proposed a broad “click to cancel” rule requiring it be as easy for a consumer to cancel a subscription service as it is to sign up for it. The commission received 1,163 public comments and has yet to issue a final rule. But it’s worth noting that many fintech startups have promoted their mission as serving consumers who are left behind (or mistreated) by traditional financial firms. That makes the cancellation issue particularly troubling. WHY IT MATTERS The fintech industry’s reputation has taken a hit this year with a spike in regulatory enforcement actions and the failure of banking-as-a-service provider Synapse exposing the chinks in fintech “banks’” FDIC insurance claims. The subscription cancellation problem at multiple startups could become yet another black eye. MORE Is Your Money Really Safe In An ‘FDIC-Insured’ Fintech Account?

Title: How Eli Lilly Outpaces Nvidia—Here Is One Chart

Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images Move over, AI. The real bubble brewing isn’t in artificial intelligence—it’s in weight loss. Wall Street has been hyperventilating over Nvidia and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But another titan has started to inflate. Ladies and gentlemen, let’s talk about Eli Lilly. There’s something curious about the chart below. Nvidia, the poster child of the AI revolution, has seen its share price skyrocket. But Eli Lilly’s stock has been on an even wilder ride. It’s not just its share price that’s eye-popping. Eli Lilly’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings, has also ballooned up into uncharted territory. What’s fueling the meteoric rise? Obesity. The Effects of Scientific Thinking on Startup Success If data is the new oil and AI is the new energy, then losing weight is the final moonshot. Eli Lilly has been in the limelight among investors thanks to its obesity drug, Mounjaro. But here’s the problem: Eli Lilly isn’t the only game in town. Enter Novo Nordisk and its heavyweight contender, Ozempic. Eli Lilly doesn’t own the obesity market. Not the way Google dominates the search market. Or Microsoft dominates enterprise software. Obesity drugs are a duopoly at best. There’s Eli and there’s Novo. Just like Pepsi vs. Coca-Cola. Despite this, investors seem to have made up their one-track mind. Eli Lilly’s P/E ratio is more than double that of Novo Nordisk. Meanwhile, other pharmaceutical heavyweights like Roche, J&J, and AstraZeneca are trading at industry-average P/E ratios of around 30. What’s going on? Let’s channel the wisdom of Peter Lynch. He’s the legendary fund manager who penned One Up on Wall Street. He told us how much he had avoided hot stocks. The higher something climbs, the harder it will fall, he believed. In Lynch’s world, a high P/E ratio isn’t inherently bad. But it does mean all the high growth prospects have already been priced into the current share price. And for Eli Lilly to trade at double that of Novo Nordisk, it means investors are expecting Lilly to grow twice as fast in the coming years in a boxing ring situation against Novo. And Lilly would grow three times faster than the industry average as a drugmaker. Why are investors and analysts so smitten? I think it’s the collective escalation of commitment—a fancy way of saying that once Wall Street falls in love with a stock, it tends to double down. Analysts who have previously issued “buy” recommendations may be reluctant to backpedal. Institutional investors who have bought in, if they were to unload, would have a lot of explaining to do. And if three national magazines have fawned over the CEO, no one is going to stick their neck out singing another tune until something clearly is not working. Maybe one more sinister boost came from the FDA. It recently issued guidelines forbidding pharmacies from compounding “me-too” products that mimic the branded obesity drugs. During the shortages, pharmacies were allowed to manufacture alternatives with the same active ingredient, essentially allowing them to infringe on patents temporarily. Then last week, the FDA abruptly declared that the shortages of obesity drugs are over. So no more copycat stuff. Even though, of course, there are still lingering supply chain issues. Patients reportedly cannot access the needed drugs. The branded version is far more expensive, so those who had been able to afford the medication, now may no longer. I can’t tell for sure, but the FDA surely appears to be cozying up to Big Pharma. It looks as if it’s out to protect incumbents before they’ve even sorted out their operational hiccups. I don’t know if the government is looking out for consumer interest in broadening access or saving the corporate bottom line. Bad optics, that’s all I’ll say. For long-term success, Eli Lilly—or any company, for that matter—needs to perform in the short term while transforming for the long haul. That means sorting out current supply chain issues, meeting market demand, and investing aggressively in the next technological platform. Remember Angry Birds? Kids and adults were all playing until suddenly they weren’t. Being a one-hit wonder is a risky business model. Every novelty wears out eventually. Obesity drugs might be the hot ticket now, but patents will expire, competitors can catch up, and markets always move on. One of the hardest but most crucial strategies for a company riding high is to temper market expectations. It might seem counterintuitive—why would you want to downplay your success? Because you want to create room to exceed those expectations, which is far better than the alternative. Overdeliver, underpromise. Expectation management 101. Mark Zuckerberg provided a masterclass in this. When Apple changed iPhone privacy settings, Facebook’s ad revenue slowed. Instead of sugarcoating the situation, Zuckerberg came clean. In fact, he screamed and shouted about how bad the situation would be. He tempered Wall Street’s expectations. That gave time for Zuckerberg to build better predictive algorithms. Fast-forward a few years, and Meta is back on track. And he has even had the spare money to invest in the Metaverse, then the beautiful Ray-Ban goggles, and now Gen AI video software for Facebook users. Same thing for Netflix and Spotify. They were both once go-go stocks that went down and made a second comeback with a more realistic P/E. The second time, they came back with strong earnings and stronger revenue. Not just an inflated P/E. All bubbles eventually burst. The question isn’t if, but when. At the end of the day, sustainable growth beats a fleeting high every time. You can also sleep better at night. And as history has shown us, the bigger the bubble grows, the louder it bursts. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: OpenAI’s revolving door risk factor

Good morning. Looks like Night at the Museum is becoming a tad more realistic. Cambridge University’s Museum of Zoology is using AI to let dead animals, like a cockroach and a fin whale skeleton, tell their own stories. “Part of the experiment is to see whether, by giving these animals their own voices, people think differently about them,” assistant director Jack Ashby told the Guardian. Maybe, but that AI-infused dodo faces some tough conversations about the fate of its species.—David Meyer Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. OpenAI took a big hit when its longtime chief technology officer, Mira Murati, abruptly left earlier this month. Now the buzzy AI company is facing another Murati-related crisis: She’s reportedly trying to poach current OpenAI employees for her next gig. What that gig involves is unclear, according to tech news site The Information, which cites two anonymous sources. Murati hasn’t told the potential hires whether the job would be at an existing company or a planned startup. Mysterious, right? The intrigue comes as OpenAI’s research division undergoes a leadership shakeup that has prompted several researchers to request transfers to other teams. Adding to the upheaval is the fact that another researcher recently left the company. Meanwhile, OpenAI is also trying to fend off an exodus of employees to a startup created by OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever, who announced his exit in May. Of course, OpenAI isn’t always on the losing end of the recruitment wars. On Monday, Microsoft said Sebastien Bubeck, its vice president of generative AI research, was leaving to join, yes, OpenAI, in which Microsoft is a major investor. —Kali Hays Do you find $3,500 an excessive price for Apple’s Vision augmented-reality tech? According to Bloomberg, Apple is preparing a $2,000 little sibling to the Vision Pro—and as you might guess, they’re cutting a few corners. The biggest omission would be that of the “EyeSight” feature, which shows (not very convincing) representations of the user’s eyes on the headset’s exterior. The materials would apparently be cheaper and the processor “inferior," Bloomberg reports. The Vision Pro hasn’t been a massive commercial success, and Apple needs to show it’s a worthy competitor as Meta makes inroads into the lower-priced portion of the headset market with its Ray-Ban smart glasses. And now that Meta has given a preview of its next-generation Orion smart glasses, with augmented reality lenses, Apple can't afford to sit still. The cheaper (though still expensive) Apple Vision headset could apparently go on sale next year. —DM SpaceX has made history yet again. On Sunday, Elon Musk’s space outfit launched one of its giant Starships for the fifth time—and then caught the returning rocket booster. The Super Heavy booster came back down to the Mechazilla launch tower from which it came, with Mechazilla’s robotic arms capturing the hovering Super Heavy in a “chopstick” maneuver. “Even in this day and age, what we just saw—that looked like magic,” said SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot. Or just darn good science. This has huge implications for rocket reusability, and they got it right on the first try. That’s genuinely impressive. —DM Adobe is joining the wave of companies pushing into AI video. Kind of. On Monday, it introduced its Firefly video model across several new tools, as a test. One tool is called Generative Extend, which lets users add up to two seconds to their existing videos or make small adjustments to them. Video makers can use it to add more footage of someone walking or to fix the tilt of their head, for example—all without having to reshoot the scenes. The tool is available through Adobe Premiere Pro. Adobe also debuted tools for creating up to five seconds of video by entering text prompts and also for turning still images into video. These two tools, available as a test through Adobe’s Firefly app, compete with products from Runway and with OpenAI’s Sora, which has been showcased publicly, but isn’t yet available. Clearly, users won’t be able to make full-length movies, or even short-form ones, with Adobe’s new AI video tools. But it’s a start.—Sharon Goldman Just when you thought tech IPOs were dead, along comes Horizon Robotics. The company, which is expected to make its public market debut this week, seems purpose-built for the moment. AI bona fides: check! Triple-digit revenue growth: check! Big name backers: check! But don’t look to the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange for this listing. Horizon Robotics is a Chinese company and it’s listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. According to Bloomberg, Chinese tech giants Baidu and Alibaba have already committed to buying shares in the offering, which is expected to raise $800 million and value Horizon at $6 billion. China and the U.S. may be locked in a cold war over AI chips and technology, but when it comes to IPOs, it's advantage Beijing. — Alexei Oreskovic —Google likes nuclear too. Following in the footsteps of Amazon and Microsoft, the search giant announced a plan to get nuclear power for its datacenters. —U.S. weighs capping exports of AI chips from Nvidia and AMD to some countries.

The US presidential campaign is in its final weeks and we’re dedicated to helping you understand the stakes. In this election cycle, it’s more important than ever to provide context beyond the headlines. But in-depth reporting is costly, so to continue this vital work, we have an ambitious goal to add 5,000 new members. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Progressives conquered economic policy under Biden. Would they lose it under Harris? by Andrew Prokop When Kamala Harris gave her campaign’s biggest economic speech yet in Pittsburgh last month, she tried to keep everyone in her party happy. She did not succeed. Attempting to strike a balance between progressive and pro-business themes, Harris said she’d hold corporations accountable if they didn’t play by the rules — but opined that “most companies are working hard to do the right thing.” She referenced the activist presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but in calling for “experimentation” rather than sweeping transformational change. Rather than being “constrained by ideology,” Harris said, she’d seek “practical solutions to problems” and “applying metrics to our analysis.” The speech had little populist fire to be found, and, coming amidst extensive courting of Wall Street and Silicon Valley donors by Harris’s team, it set off alarm bells among some on the left. “My God,” the progressive economist Hal Singer wrote on X afterward. “We lost Kamala.” The “we” is an alliance of advocates that has, over the past 10 years, come together in a surprisingly successful project to reshape the Democratic Party’s economic agenda. Some wanted to take on Big Tech and Big Business. Others wanted the government to revive US manufacturing, while ditching free trade and getting tougher on China. And others wanted big new spending on social policy. But these advocates joined to fight a common enemy: neoliberalism. They sought to discredit the pro-free market and government-skeptical assumptions — and some of the specific people — that they argue drove economic policy in the Clinton and Obama years. The status quo, they believed, had hurt the American people and backfired on Democrats electorally. In both the inside game of Democratic Party politics and the outside “war of ideas,” these post-neoliberals triumphed during the Trump and early Biden years — converting many party elites to their cause, securing key appointments, and shaping what became known to some as the New Progressive Economics. The reformers went from irrelevant underdogs to well-organized, well-funded practitioners of hardball power politics shaping national policy. “This was an astonishing success, a seizure of some of the commanding heights of policymaking,” the historian Quinn Slobodian wrote in 2022. Harris’s ascent has thrown all this into question. Some are urging Harris to undo some of Biden’s changes and steer the party closer to where it was in the Obama years — for instance, by being less hostile to big business and big tech. These critics point to Biden’s unpopularity, arguing that the new agenda has been tried and failed. So far, Harris’s team has tried to keep both the reformers and their critics happy, sending signals to each camp suggesting she’s with them. But for now, winning is her top priority. “I don’t think she has an economic philosophy, and I don’t think she wants to have one until she wins the election,” one advocate in close contact with the campaign told me. (This article is based on conversations with policy experts, advocates, and former government officials, several of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak more freely.) But Harris and her party will have to choose a path forward if she wins. And understanding the present crossroads requires reckoning with why Democrats adopted this agenda in the first place. Did the New Progressive Economics rise due to fundamental political shifts — or was it something of a fluke in a historical moment that has now passed? And, on both the politics and the substance: Did it succeed, or did it fail? The transformation of the Democratic Party began during Barack Obama’s second term, when some progressive thinkers and activists’ disappointment and frustration with his administration boiled over. The country had recovered from the Great Recession, but slowly. Banks were now somewhat more regulated, but Obama hadn’t fundamentally transformed the finance sector or punished bankers with prosecutions. Progressive critics believed this was because Obama’s top appointees, like Larry Summers and Tim Geithner, were too sympathetic to finance and too beholden to the old economic establishment’s thinking. The critics argued that there were far deeper problems with the US economy that required far more sweeping change. But what change, exactly? Inspired in part by Occupy Wall Street and its “We are the 99 percent” slogan, “inequality” became a new funding priority of progressive donors and foundations. “There was an understanding starting to form that the economy wasn’t delivering,” Felicia Wong, president of the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank, told me. Much of the rethinking was happening in Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s orbit. Warren, a Harvard law professor and consumer law expert, had come to Washington in late 2008 to help Congress oversee the bank bailouts; she soon won national fame with her tough questioning of both bankers and Obama officials like Geithner. Warren’s pet idea for a new consumer protection agency made it into law, and Obama gave her a temporary gig setting that agency up. But when she asked Obama if he’d give her the job permanently, he declined, arguing — likely correctly — that she couldn’t be confirmed by the Senate. “I was disappointed, but not surprised,” Warren later wrote. The natural solution was to run for Senate herself; she won her Massachusetts seat in 2012. Yet, nearly two years into her term, and after dismal 2014 midterm results for Democrats, Warren was frustrated — Obama’s team, she thought, still seemed beholden to the old ways. So she started to pick fights. She sank Obama’s nomination of Antonio Weiss, an investment banker, for a Treasury Department position, and gave a fiery speech blasting a financial regulation rollback in Congress’s year-end spending bill. Warren believed “personnel is policy,” and that Obama was simply appointing and listening to too many of the wrong people. Warren also began to look beyond Wall Street in her desire to find what ailed the American economy. She embraced a theory, pushed by a small group of writers and advocates like Barry Lynn, Lina Khan, Matt Stoller, and David Dayen, that the problem wasn’t just finance but also Big Tech and big corporations generally. Traditional antitrust policy had been that the government should intervene when corporate concentration raised prices for consumers. But these advocates wanted to rethink and expand the concept of antitrust — to make it about challenging the concentration of corporate power, even when the companies in question (like Amazon) offered low prices to consumers. This was the start of the new antitrust movement. Warren’s outspokenness caught Hillary Clinton’s attention. Wary of a primary challenge from the left, she arranged a sit-down with Warren, in which the Massachusetts senator made clear what she really cared about: She didn’t want Wall Street’s preferred appointees, and she had her own list of people she liked better. Bernie Sanders’s surprisingly strong campaign amped up the populist pressure on Clinton. Yet instead of endorsing Sanders, who few believed could win, Warren remained neutral during the primaries, preserving her chance to play an inside game with Clinton afterward. Talks between Warren’s and Clinton’s camps continued up to Election Day. The Roosevelt Institute established itself as a progressive competitor to Democrats’ favorite think tank, the Center for American Progress, and sent along Warren-friendly names: binders full of progressives. Warren had made herself someone that Democratic leaders couldn’t ignore. “In early 2014, nobody cared at all what our side thought because there was no credible threat and no pain inflicted,” a former Warren aide told me. “By 2016, they did care — because there was a credible threat and there was pain inflicted.” A Clinton transition official backed up this assessment, telling Politico, “It was kind of a pain in the ass to be thinking about her all the time.” Still, though she and her allies had won a seat at the table, they weren’t at the head of the table just yet. Trump’s 2016 victory came as a seismic shock to Democrats. Party elites were so stunned by Clinton’s defeat that they began to question their fundamental assumptions about how politics worked. The establishment was grappling for answers; some of them looked in the mirror and wondered: Was this our fault? A well-funded effort to convince them that it was indeed their fault soon materialized. Influential progressives who wanted to challenge the party’s consensus saw opportunity. Larry Kramer, the head of the Hewlett Foundation, launched a heavily-funded effort to discredit neoliberalism as an “intellectual paradigm.” The Ford Foundation, having already reoriented its giving around inequality in 2015, joined in. The Omidyar Network (funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar) began its own push to “reimagine capitalism.” So during the Trump years, money flowed into think tanks and advocacy groups old and new, in a project inspired by conservative donors’ decades-long project of building a right-wing counter-establishment. In his book The Middle Out, journalist Mike Tomasky dubbed this an “increasingly at least semi-vast left-wing conspiracy” — a “network of people and groups” that “helped change the economic conversation in dramatic ways.” Close ties developed among many of these thinkers and experts, many of whom had nonprofit posts but hoped to enter government or influence appointments later on. Hewlett and Omidyar grants also funded new centers at universities and projects at certain media outlets (including this one — the Omidyar Network funded two Vox reporting projects in 2019 and 2020, though they had no editorial oversight over these projects). A key figure in this grant-making effort was Jennifer Harris, who headed the Hewlett Foundation’s grantmaking on economic issues. Harris had come to progressive economics from an unusual direction: through foreign policy. She was a national security hawk who, while working at the State Department, came to believe that the US’s longtime approach to trade deals had been disastrously captured by big corporations — that it had hollowed out important domestic industries and posed serious strategic risks in a new era of great power competition with China. Harris concluded that flawed and outdated neoliberal thinking was failing the country on many fronts. “Paradigms like neoliberalism function at a society level,” she told me. “Their power derives precisely from how many of their premises are taken for granted, and for how much consensus they enjoy, across the ideological spectrum.” The world, she continued, was at a “dangerous” juncture, due to “the return of great power competition and the urgency of climate change.” With Hewlett’s grant-making, Harris wanted to help shape a new intellectual paradigm to more effectively grapple with these new challenges. She funded many left critiques of neoliberalism, as well as a few from the right. Between 2017 and 2024, the Hewlett Foundation spent tens of millions of dollars to develop alternatives to neoliberalism. Grantees included: Progressive think tanks: Hewlett funded policy work at the Roosevelt Institute ($5.8 million), Washington Center on Equitable Growth ($6.1 million), Economic Policy Institute ($1.4 million), Demos ($1.1 million), and the Center for Economic and Policy Research ($615,000). The new antitrust movement: Grants went to Open Markets ($750,000), the American Economic Liberties Project ($450,000), and the Economic Security Project’s Anti-Monopoly Fund ($1.3 million). Groups on the right: Hewlett funded the policy group American Compass ($2.9 million) and the journal American Affairs ($1.2 million), which challenged the right’s free-market thinking. Media: Hewlett funded coverage of and reporting projects about new economic thinking at the Atlantic ($1.3 million), Boston Review ($1.9 million), and the American Prospect ($665,000), though it did not have editorial oversight over such coverage. Academia: Hewlett funded new research initiatives or centers on the economy at Harvard ($7.5 million), Yale ($4 million), Johns Hopkins ($15 million), Howard ($10 million), UC Berkeley ($9.8 million), and MIT ($7.5 million). But what, exactly, would the new agenda entail? For one, many progressives embraced Warren and her allies’ antitrust push. So did Democratic leaders, who were seeking populist policies as their party was turning against Big Tech. After the leading new antitrust movement activists had been controversially ousted from the New America Foundation think tank, they formed new advocacy groups that won Hewlett and Omidyar funding. Onetime blogger Matt Stoller became particularly influential on this topic — through his book Goliath, an email newsletter, and his pugnacious Twitter presence, he hammered home the message that Big Tech and big business were at the heart of the country’s woes. Warren, who has praised Stoller as “a brilliant thinker and writer,” released a plan to break up Big Tech companies in 2019, near the start of her own presidential campaign. But beyond aligning with the Warrenites, Jen Harris also began to help shape another pillar of Democrats’ agenda: a new industrial policy, in which the government would intervene in the economy by financially supporting key industries — with strings attached. Good free-market neoliberals had historically disdained this idea, believing government attempts to meddle in the economy would have bad results. But industrial policy appealed to several important Democratic constituencies. Labor wanted more US union jobs. Climate change activists wanted money for the clean energy sector. National security hawks wanted to challenge China. Political operatives thought it might play well in the Rust Belt. Much of the business community might be happy about it too — after all, it involved giving US companies money. Democratic policy wunderkind Jake Sullivan liked what Jen Harris — and Elizabeth Warren — had to say. In line for a top policy job under Hillary Clinton, Sullivan had been one of those undergoing a dark night of the soul since 2016. He had considered a top lobbying job at Google, but instead chose to work at nonprofits rethinking the policy agenda. And by June 2018, he sounded excited about what he was seeing. “There’s something profound happening in American politics right now,” Sullivan wrote in Democracy. He asserted the country was at a “turning point,” disillusioned by free-market excesses and open to bold new policies. “Democrats should not blush too much, or pay too much heed, when political commentators arch their eyebrows about the party moving left,” he continued. “The center of gravity itself is moving, and this is a good thing.” The left did not technically win the 2020 Democratic primary, as Joe Biden — the most old school of the major contenders — emerged triumphant over Sanders and Warren. But Biden embraced the new agenda anyway. He had long been close to labor and skeptical of pointy-headed economists from elite universities. (“He’s so old,” Felicia Wong of the Roosevelt Institute later said, “that it turns out he’s actually pre-neoliberal.”) Now, amid the deepening pandemic crisis, the idea of an “FDR-size presidency” sounded appealing. Key aides around him, like Ron Klain and Bruce Reed, agreed that bold progressive thinking was needed, and Sullivan became the campaign’s top policy adviser. Wong was named to the transition team. Other progressives wanted to hold Biden’s feet to the fire from the outside once he won. Warren’s chief of staff Dan Geldon departed her office, starting a firm pushing opposition research about potential appointees he deemed unreliable. Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project frequently disparaged potential nominees as corporate hacks and sellouts. Such attacks often showed up in the American Prospect and the Intercept, two publications solidly aligned with the new agenda. Hewlett or Omidyar money helped fund the links in this chain — the semi-vast left-wing conspiracy was at work. (Its participants argued they were fighting against far greater corporate money and influence.) The good-cop, bad-cop approach succeeded. Champions of the new progressive economics such as Jen Harris and many Warren allies scored key White House and regulatory posts. Biden’s Cabinet secretaries were more traditional Democrats, but when they tried to staff their agencies, their picks were often overruled by the White House in favor of alternatives preferred by the Warrenites. The new antitrust movement scored particularly big, though it took some hardball. Biden got Lina Khan confirmed by the Senate as an FTC commissioner and only afterward revealed he’d make her the commission’s chair; Republicans (and some Democrats) were shocked that the 32-year-old calling for a total rethink of antitrust policy would be in charge. Reformers also wanted attorney Jonathan Kanter, a longtime critic of Google, for the top Department of Justice antitrust job. Attorney General Merrick Garland initially seemed disinclined to follow their counsel — but when word leaked out that Garland was considering other contenders, articles slamming them appeared in the Prospect and the Intercept. Kanter got the gig. Quickly, Biden’s administration took on a different character from Obama’s. ”Economists and financiers are simply far less influential,” Ezra Klein reported. The nonprofit world and labor leaders rose in influence. So did elite progressive lawyers: the Biden administration was chock-full of Yale Law grads, including Sullivan, Khan, and Jen Harris. (Twenty-five of Harris’s Hewlett grantees got Biden administration jobs, according to Tomasky’s book The Middle Out.) Progressives’ appointment success took on particular importance because Biden took a hands-off approach to economic policy. It was “very, very rare,” a former administration official told me, for a decision memo outlining different courses of action supported by different economic aides to be sent to the president. Biden would offer his feedback on policy plans during briefings; but staff would typically send “joint recommendation memos” that he’d then sign. In practice, that gave staff great freedom to shape policy, so long as they could agree with each other. When the Hewlett Foundation hosted a conference on the future of neoliberalism, several Biden administration officials attended. So did the American Prospect’s Bob Kuttner, a longtime, often-lonely critic of the economic policy establishment. Afterward, Kuttner marveled: “I never thought I’d live to see a time when my allies were in charge of the government.” With Democrats in control of Congress for the first time in a decade, the party wanted to make the most of their governing majority — and that meant going big. They started off with a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill for pandemic recovery. Economists like Larry Summers complained that this was far too big — that its size seemed to go far beyond what economic analysis suggested was necessary, and that it could worsen inflation. Democrats in Congress and the administration dismissed these warnings, not wanting to repeat Obama’s mistake of spending too little. The rest of the Democrats’ big bold legislative agenda ran into the constraints of a 50-50 Senate. Republicans helped pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, but for other progressive priorities, Democrats had to tailor their plans to the restrictions of the budget reconciliation process (which bypasses the filibuster). Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) then nixed the sweeping social spending in the Build Back Better plan. But in the summer of 2022, Manchin did approve massive new clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. Republicans also signed onto the CHIPS Act, a bill to award billions in grants to bolster a US semiconductor manufacturing industry. The bill was meant to address national security risks about the current Taiwan-centered supply chain, which was vulnerable to a future conflict with China. This was part of a broader Biden administration hardline toward Beijing that included tariffs and dramatic limits on semiconductor exports. The IRA and CHIPS Act meant the industrial policy agenda championed by Jen Harris had made it into law, and she helped steer its implementation in the administration. Meanwhile, Khan and Kanter swung into action on antitrust, suing Amazon, Meta, Apple, and Google, among other companies. Both became key to what the administration dubbed “Bidenomics” (and the New York Times would later dub Harris “The queen bee of Bidenomics”). But now that the new agenda was actually being implemented, its critics began to speak up — while its inherent tensions became more evident. Khan’s FTC tenure was cheered by progressives but controversial among agency staff and deeply loathed by business. She was criticized for bringing cases that seemed doomed in court — winning such cases would depend on persuading judges of new legal thinking, a project of years or decades. Khan and Kanter’s main impact was deterrence: fear of expensive investigations helped chill mergers and acquisitions. Democratic policy now appeared to be that big business shouldn’t get bigger. Meanwhile, the new industrial policy was sending billions in tax credits and grants to big US companies, which was a bit incongruous. Indeed, Warren and her allies increasingly looked askance at the CHIPS Act grants being made by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who they viewed as far too eager to send money out the door with insufficient oversight. Progressives wanted to attach stringent labor, environmental, and social justice standards to such payouts. Others argued that demanding too much — the tendency Ezra Klein dubbed “everything-bagel liberalism” — could hamper the new industries from being built. (So far, spending on factory construction has doubled, but we are still years away from seeing whether these businesses will succeed.) The nitty-gritty of implementation also made clear that no one approach could make every constituency happy. Climate hawks complained about the administration’s tariffs on Chinese clean energy companies. Auto workers making gasoline-powered cars objected to a push toward electric vehicles. National security doves worried Biden’s China policy was too provocative. Unions’ interest in creating high-paying US jobs naturally clashed with corporate incentives to lower manufacturing costs. And did the administration really want to bolster US companies to help them compete globally — or did it want to take those companies down a peg? Yet in the public mind, the new economic agenda was largely overshadowed by a problem the reformers had not anticipated: the highest inflation in four decades. It was the neoliberals who had warned about this, while the progressives were caught flat-footed, as was the Biden administration. “People don’t like inflation and we got a lot of it,” economist Adam Ozimek told me. This was a global phenomenon and not primarily caused by Biden’s policies, but the administration was slow to adjust and made it somewhat worse. “The stimulus was way too large, it came out all at once, and they proceeded to follow it with a variety of spending packages,” Ozimek said. He added that the economy is now in a good place after hefty interest rate hikes, but that we took a “chaotic path” getting there. In the end, Biden’s economic policy ended up historically unpopular. That’s left a chasm between progressives who tout Biden’s presidency as one of the most productive and consequential in recent history, and a public deeply unsatisfied with his record. Perhaps the anti-Biden sentiment was more about his age, foreign crises, and inflation that mostly wasn’t his fault — but it’s hard to blame it on neoliberalism. Shortly after Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket, a factional contest for influence kicked off when billionaire Reid Hoffman — who had donated millions to elect Harris — publicly declared that she should replace Lina Khan at the FTC. Progressives responded with outrage, rallying to Khan’s defense and demanding Harris pledge to keep her in place. Harris has not yet taken a position on Khan’s future. Many believe Harris will be friendlier to business, and especially to Silicon Valley, than Biden was. These fears tend to center around Harris’s brother-in-law, Tony West, who is Uber’s chief legal officer and has become an important Harris campaign adviser. West has been cultivating Wall Street and Silicon Valley support for the campaign, sending the message that Harris would be an ally to the business community. More broadly, some center-left commentators argue the time has come for a rethink of Democrats’ rethink. Jonathan Chait proposed that Harris should revert to something more like the policy and politics of the Obama years (since Obama was a more popular and electorally successful president than Biden), while Matt Yglesias argued that the backlash against neoliberalism has “mostly served in practice as a way to tell people that it’s okay to do sloppy economic analysis.” Warren’s allies, meanwhile, were somewhat wrongfooted by Harris’s ascent, as they had not built much of a relationship with her. An incident last year where Warren sounded unsure on whether Harris should stay on the ticket as Biden’s running mate reportedly led to some tension between their respective camps. Still, some early signs suggested Harris might continue the Biden-Warren approach. In August, her campaign announced that their economic advisory team would include Biden’s former National Economic Council director Brian Deese, and Bharat Ramamurti, a one-time Warren aide who had been Deese’s deputy. The reformers were initially encouraged when, in mid-August, Harris proposed a “federal ban on corporate price gouging” to combat high grocery costs. “I was really surprised and pleased that she pointed at big food corporations as a causal factor in higher food prices,” Matt Stoller told me shortly afterward. But centrist pundits criticized the idea, Republicans accused Harris of proposing socialistic price controls, and the campaign soon put out word that the policy would have limited impact. Later that month, Harris’s advisers said she supported a proposal to tax unrealized capital gains (stock that had appreciated but not yet been sold) for people worth more than $100 million. It was a way to raise revenue and hit the wealthy; in a CNBC appearance, Ramamurti defended the idea from skeptical anchors. But investors were furious. Soon afterward, billionaire investor Mark Cuban, a prominent supporter of Harris in close contact with the campaign, insisted that she wouldn’t actually go through with the idea, because it would “kill the stock market.” As the campaign has gone on, Harris’s economic line has appeared to some to grow more cautious. Her policy plan promises a lot of new and expanded tax credits, and would raise taxes on corporations and the very wealthy, but says relatively little about expanding the welfare state. She offered an olive branch to cryptocurrency companies — in contrast to top Biden appointees and Warren, who wanted to crack down on the industry. Harris has talked about cracking down on corporate “bad actors,” but emphasized that those are the exception. When I followed up with Stoller in late September after Harris’s Pittsburgh speech, his mood was one of deep pessimism. “I think she’s gonna do what rich people — billionaires — want,” he told me. The campaign’s economic proposals, Stoller said, were “a mishmash of nonsense.” The progressives who had joined the campaign’s economic team, he now believed, didn’t “have any real influence” and were only included to throw a bone to critics on the left. “I think this is the Tony West show,” he said. “And if she wants to make it clear that it’s not, she needs to say so.” If Harris won and returned to neoliberal thinking, Stoller argued, the consequences would be “a failed presidency,” “intraparty war” and perhaps even “losing a war with China.” (After we spoke, Stoller called me back to say he was speaking for himself and not his employer, and that his views on Harris’s campaign changed day-to-day.) Others were more optimistic, or at least agnostic. Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project told me while he was “concerned” about Harris’s rhetoric and apparent friendliness to the cryptocurrency industry, he was cautiously optimistic that Harris would keep Khan and Kanter in place. “There isn’t really a meaningful policy apparatus and the transition is extremely barebones and noncommittal,” Hauser said. “So it’s hard to know what is real versus what will turn out to be smoke signals that are entirely irrelevant.” The antitrust agenda, reformers worry, could be dropped or seriously weakened. But for industrial policy, the question is less whether it will continue than what it will look like. Reformers fear it will become a corporate subsidy program in which the priorities of labor and other progressive interests take a backseat — that is, that it could start looking a lot more neoliberal. Meanwhile, the world has changed from the Trump years. On a range of issues, the leftward movement of Democratic politicians and voters appears to have abated. Personnel changes and strategy shifts have occurred at the foundations and think tanks that pushed the new progressive economics. New topics, like AI, have risen to the top of the agenda, and need to be hashed out. For instance: should the US boost domestic AI development as part of security competition with China, or is any big AI company so dangerous that it should be regulated within an inch of its life? The post-neoliberals’ level of influence in these debates will hinge on whether they’ve become an inextricable part of the Democratic coalition — or whether their rise under Biden was born of unusual circumstances that no longer exist. A critic of the reformers mused to me that their rise to power may have been largely due to “a lack of supervision” in the Biden White House: “And maybe once the president returns, the whole thing starts to implode.” You’ve read 1 article in the last month Here at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

Title: The Quiet Trump-Harris Trade Agreement

On chickens, cute trucks, semiconductor chips, and bananas Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts After former President Donald Trump’s surprise victory in 2016, his administration imposed several rounds of tariffs on China on everything from washing machines to steel. The move was described by the nonpartisan conservative organization the Tax Foundation as one of the “largest tax increases in decades.” And yet, protectionist economic thinking has since gained traction in both parties. In a rare instance of agreement, President Joe Biden retained most of his predecessor’s tariffs—and imposed even more earlier this year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen described her own evolution on this topic succinctly: “People like me grew up with the view: If people send you cheap goods, you should send a thank-you note. That’s what standard economics basically says … I would never, ever again say, ‘Send a thank-you note.’” Essentially, Yellen used to think that if China wanted to flood the United States with cheap goods, why complain? Well, now she appears more concerned about the cost of all those cheap goods to the nation’s domestic manufacturing base. On today’s episode of Good on Paper, I’m joined by the Cato Institute’s vice president of general economics, Scott Lincicome, to examine this popular narrative—one that he doesn’t put much stock in, largely because the high cost of tariffs are disproportionately borne by poorer people, but also because of the political dysfunction they sow: “The economics of trade are counterintuitive,” Lincicome explains. “And so tariff policy is notoriously corrupt. And so there’s a lot of political dysfunction, along with just hiring all those lobbyists to get special tariffs or special exemptions. But also, it’s just a very politically perilous policy.” The following is a transcript of the episode: [Music] Jerusalem Demsas: There was an interesting policy exchange about tariffs between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during their debate last month. Kamala Harris: My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20 percent tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result, for middle-class families, in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires. Demsas: Then Trump hit back, pointing out that the Biden-Harris team had been all too happy to keep the tariffs going. Donald Trump: First of all, I have no sales tax. That’s an incorrect statement. She knows that. We’re doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we’ve done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off, because it was so much money, they can’t. It would totally destroy everything that they’ve set out to do. They’ve taken in billions of dollars from China and other places. They’ve left the tariffs on. Demsas: This exchange flew by many people. There was a lot going on in that debate, and this happened in the first few minutes. But Trump is pointing out something interesting here—that while Harris is calling his tariffs a sales tax, she and Biden kept the majority of his tariffs when they came into office. Looking back on 2019, Biden had similarly criticized Trump’s trade policy, arguing at the time that “any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.” While I think it’s important to highlight this similarity, it’s also important not to overstate it. Trump is now promising a 60 percent tariff on goods from China and a 20 percent tariff on everything else the U.S. imports. And in a speech last week, Trump said he’d “impose whatever tariffs are required—100 percent, 200 percent, 1,000 percent.” This is far greater than anything Biden or Harris have publicly considered. [Music] Demsas: Welcome to Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. I’m your host, Jerusalem Demsas, a staff writer here at The Atlantic. And today we’re talking tariffs, trade, protectionism, and more. The standard economic narrative around tariffs is pretty negative. As my guest today has explained in a quip now famously memorialized on a novelty T-shirt: “Tariffs not only impose immense economic costs but also fail to achieve their primary policy aims and foster political dysfunction along the way.” It’s a busy shirt. Scott Lincicome is the vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute and has written broadly, including here at The Atlantic, about why the parties shouldn’t be so quick to embrace tariffs. [Music] Demsas: Scott, welcome to the show. Scott Lincicome: Well, thanks for having me. Demsas: We’re going to talk about tariffs today, so I’m going to start with the simplest question: What is a tariff? Lincicome: A tariff is a tax applied to an imported product, usually a good but, in theory, you could try to apply tariffs to services, as well. Demsas: What kinds of things that people commonly buy have tariffs on them in the United States? Lincicome: I think one of the most common examples we use is pickup trucks. In the 1960s, there was a dispute with the Europeans over chicken, of all things. That led to a tax on pickup trucks— Demsas: Wait. Wait. Wait. Slow that down. How do we get from chickens to pickup trucks? Lincicome: They were going after our chickens, so we put tariffs on their pickup trucks, and they stayed. Now we still have a 25 percent tax—tariff—on imported pickup trucks from everywhere except a few free-trade-agreement countries, like Mexico. So one of the reasons why we don’t have some of those cool little pickup trucks that you might see in Japan or whatever is because they’re subject to really ridiculous tariffs. And automakers abroad don’t want to have to deal with all the regulatory compliance and that kind of stuff and then pay another 25 percent tariff. It’s actually a great example of the things that tariffs do beyond just raising prices. They limit availability and consumer choice, and they stick around forever. We have tariffs on the books on shoes and clothing and other things that go back to the Smoot-Hawley days. They’re really hard to remove once you get them into place. Demsas: You just said something interesting. Who pays the tariff? Lincicome: It’s a little complicated. Legally, the importer in the United States, in almost all cases, is paying the tariffs. If you are a U.S. company and you are importing stuff, you’re going to be paying the tariff, by law. There’s a little exception to that, but we don’t need to worry about that. The more complicated thing comes in who actually pays, because, in theory, a foreign exporter can lower his price to essentially absorb the tariff costs. Let’s say you’re shipping widgets into the United States, and they’re $100. All of a sudden, a 25 percent tariff gets attached to it. You have, really, two basic choices: still sell at a hundred and have the importer pay $25 (25 percent of a hundred), or you lower your price to 80 and then have the importer pay $20 in tariffs. But to the importer, it’s all the same thing, right? It’s still $100. So the tariff hasn’t changed the calculus. In that sense, the foreign exporter is bearing the incidence of the tariff. Then we have the empirical question. So the empirical question is: What actually happens? Well, what actually happens is, in the vast majority of cases, importers and consumers pay the tariffs. You only have a situation where foreign exporters pay tariffs when the market that the foreign exporter wants to sell into is just massive—really important—and the exporter says, You know what? I just want to maintain market share, so I’m going to lower my prices. Typically, that’s not what happens. Typically, the consumer, the importer is going to pay the tariff. It might not be a hundred percent; the exporter might discount by a few bucks here and there. But, overall, as an empirical matter, typically consumers, importers pay. And that was certainly the case with the Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminum and Chinese imports. Studies show that about 95 percent of the tariff incidence fell onto American companies and consumers. Demsas: And so as any listener listening to this can tell, you don’t really like tariffs. Economists, in general, don’t really like tariffs. Why is that? Can you walk us through the standard economic story for why tariffs are bad? Lincicome: I’ll start out with saying that economists are okay with tariffs in certain contexts—national security, for example. There’s a legitimate case that the United States—I’d say, a strong case the United States—shouldn’t be buying its tanks and planes and laser-guided missiles from China, that tariffs can serve a role there. But economists don’t like tariffs for a few reasons. First is that they’re costly. A tariff is a tax. It’s a tax typically borne by consumers and importers. Those consumers and importers typically are poorer, so it’s a regressive tax, meaning: More burden is paid by poorer people. They spend a larger share of their incomes on, say, tariffed bananas or whatever. But the second reason is that they are very inefficient taxes, meaning—so good tax policy is: You want a very broad base, and you want it to be very transparent, and you want to minimize gaming and other things that can poke holes and make the tax less distortionary. A tariff doesn’t qualify for anything I just said, right? It’s applied on a narrow set of products. It’s very opaque. Unlike a sales tax, you don’t get a receipt on that pickup truck that says, Oh, you just paid an extra 25 percent for this, right? It’s subject to all sorts of gaming because tariffs will vary, typically, based on the type of products. You get what’s called tariff engineering, where you’ll classify—I’ll go back to cars. There’s a famous example: Ford vans were imported without seats to get a lower tariff, and then, literally at the docks, they installed the seats and then drove them off to the warehouses. So it’s a really distortionary and inefficient way to raise revenue or do anything else you want to do with them. The other big thing, though, is that they’re pretty ineffective at boosting the companies that are getting protected and the workers that are getting protected. For example, I mentioned we have tariffs on shoes. Some of them are ridiculously high, more than 34—almost 40 percent. We have not saved any shoe jobs in the United States. We have almost no jobs in shoe manufacturing. You basically are just having consumers pay a tax for little to no good reason. And in case after case after case, what you see is: Most companies that are protected by tariffs either end up going away after the tariffs are lifted, or they’re seeking perpetual protection, right? The other big thing is that tariffs, by insulating companies from competition, discourage them from innovating. If you have a guaranteed market, you’re probably not going to be hyper-focused on staying lean and mean and really focused on delivering the best value to your customer. You will get fat, lazy, and happy. You’ll spend a lot of money on lobbying to maintain the tariffs, less money on being productive. For example, U.S. steel. So there’s probably no industry in the history of the United States that has received more protection than U.S. steel. It’s definitely on the Mount Rushmore of protectionist industries. And U.S. Steel is notoriously inefficient, in part because of that protection. It’s now trying to be bought out by Nippon Steel, a Japanese company. And the goal to—supporters of that deal, including U.S. Steel, by the way, say that Nippon Steel will help it innovate, provide it with better management practices, an influx of capital to upgrade its services. So put that all together, and economists say, You get high cost, you don’t achieve your objectives, and this is pretty bad. And then you throw in—the historians have looked back at tariff history, especially in the 19th century but even most recently. And tariffs are really historically associated with corruption and cronyism. And that goes back to them being kind of a hidden tax. Also, they target foreigners, and that makes it easier to sell. The economics of trade are counterintuitive. And so tariff policy is notoriously corrupt. And so there’s a lot of political dysfunction, along with just hiring all those lobbyists to get special tariffs or special exemptions. But also, it’s just a very politically perilous policy, as well. Demsas: You said a lot there. And I want to dig in on a few of these things, but I think as a broad overview, obviously, the idea is: You have to do a benefit-cost analysis of tariff policy. And you’ve obviously articulated a lot of reasons why there are high costs to tariffs, but, as you mentioned with national security, for instance, there are a lot of noneconomic things that policymakers are concerned with that they may want to use tariffs for. And so you think about the implications of what tariffs are trying to do, and often there’s this goal of, We want to spur some sort of industry in the United States. Often, it’s domestic manufacturing, right? You kind of asided to that with the shoe example. But there’s a history of this, right? Actually, last week, we just had on the show Oliver Kim, who was talking to us about the East Asian development miracle. And one thing that a lot of East Asian countries are credited with doing is having protected native industries and ensuring that those industries were able to succeed on the world market. And there was a lot of protectionism that was involved in doing that, including tariffs. And so what I guess I would ask you is, firstly, do you feel like that is a goal the U.S. government should have of trying to spur domestic manufacturing? Do you think that’s an important goal? Lincicome: No. At least not via tariffs. I think there is a million things that the United States government could be doing to boost the manufacturing sector. I should note, of course, the United States is the world’s second-largest manufacturing nation in terms of output, in terms of productivity. So the stuff we make per worker—we’re absolutely crushing it. No. 1 in the world, basically, for large, industrialized nations, so it’s not like the United States is this weak, nothing-burger nation when it comes to manufacturing. But that aside, there’s a couple caveats I think you need to include when you talk about Asian protectionism and industrial policy. First is: That came with a lot of free trade too. While, certainly, there was some protection for certain industries, there was also a lot of exposure to competition in export markets, in particular, but also in import markets. And, though, there was a lot of tariff liberalization for the things that manufacturers they were trying to support—that they needed. So it wasn’t this just blanket protectionist policy. The second big thing, though, is that there is a bit of a correlation-versus-causation thing in a lot of East Asian industrial-policy narratives because they were doing a lot of other stuff at the exact same time. And there’s a great book by Arvind Panagariya, who actually looks at South Korea and Taiwan and others and says, Actually, these economies performed better when they weren’t being protectionist—when they weren’t engaging this heavy-handed industrial policy—than when they were. So we need to be a little bit cautious there. But the third, and I think the most important one for the United States, is that the East Asian miracle applied to a radically different economy than the one in the United States in two big ways. One: Those were developing countries really trying to push infant industries, whereas most U.S. protection is—I mean, the U.S. is certainly not a developing economy. We’re a very developed economy. And most of our protection actually goes to lagging industries. It is not on the cutting edge, and one of the reasons—we have a lot of cutting-edge stuff. But typically, our protection goes to, again, shoes and steel and stuff like that—legacy industries. But the other thing is that the United States has far-more-developed capital markets than Asian economies did—very open, very fluid. And that means we have much-more-efficient investment where there might be the potential for that success and that innovation. And so it’s less likely that government planners in the United States are going to be able to pick the right industries, pick the right companies, pick the right whatever, as opposed to capital markets and VCs and private equity and all that great stuff. And in general, though, it’s just a radically different environment than what existed in, say, South Korea in the 1970s. Demsas: But then let’s take a look at the CHIPS and Science Act, for instance, right? That’s the 2022 law Joe Biden signed to bring semiconductor manufacturing to the United States. So during the pandemic, there’s a real concern about semiconductor chips, that we’re not going to be able to have as many. There’s obviously this big shortage. We’re really reliant on Taiwan, which is, of course, concerning because of its proximity to China and the threat that China poses to Taiwan’s freedom. It’s clear that there is a need to produce, at least in—if not domestically, we need to “friendshore.” We need to make sure can get those supplies from ally countries that we’re less worried about having some kind of future political risk with, but also just domestically because there might be supply-chain problems in the future that are unprecedented, like a global pandemic that we had not been expecting. And so the CHIPS Act is an industrial policy where there is a real push to get chips made here in the United States. We have factories opening up. I believe they are already producing chips. There’s an Arizona factory. Lincicome: Yeah. TSMC is not quite up yet. Demsas: Okay. Not up yet. But basically, we brought Taiwanese expertise to the United States, and they’re building here. We have American jobs that are being created here. And you may care about parts of that or not, but that seems like a policy where that’s on the cutting edge. It’s not confusing to make these chips, but it is a cutting-edge technology. It’s not a legacy industry. So how do you view the use of protection there? Lincicome: Yeah. Two things: One is that it’s really important to start by noting that this CHIPS Act is subsidies and not tariffs. Now, Biden just imposed some tariffs on semiconductors from China but, in general, the CHIPS Act is just about throwing money at companies. In general, if you’re going to ask an economist, What would you prefer: a domestic subsidy or a tariff? they’re going to say, A subsidy, nine times out of 10, right? That’s important because you’re at least—granted you’re subsidizing the production, but you’re at least—once the company gets up and running, going to be subjecting it to market forces and competition and its production and output and the rest. You’re not going to be artificially raising prices for downstream consumers and that kind of stuff. So a subsidy is definitely preferable to a tariff. And in fact, we actually applied tariffs to semiconductors in the 1980s. We had a big industrial policy push in the ’80s related to chips, Japanese memory chips. We applied a bunch of different tariffs, any dumping duties. There was a trade agreement restricting Japanese semiconductors. And what happened? Well, it raised the price of semiconductors and pushed computer manufacturers offshore from the U.S. computer manufacturers. So tariffs, again—historically not very good at achieving your objectives. But the other thing with the CHIPS Act is: It is starting to reveal some of the problems with industrial policy that we saw back then too. For example, back then, we actually picked—we, the government—picked the wrong type of semiconductor. The Department of Defense in the ’80s thought memory chips were going to be the big innovative thing of the future. So we targeted memory chips. Well, it turns out that the entire industry was actually moving towards logic chips, which are what we use today. And the government totally missed that, while imposing all of those costs. Right now, we might have a bit of a similar situation because you mentioned TSMC—and TSMC is a global leader. Okay. Cool. But also, the biggest subsidy recipient was Intel. Intel is our national champion. Intel is struggling like crazy. Intel is slated to receive as much as $45 billion in total subsidies because the CHIPS Act had grants, loans, and tax credits. So Intel is really in trouble. So did we, once again, pick a loser, along with TSMC? So that’s, I think, a concern we have to deal with. And that’s a traditional issue with industrial policy. Now, why did Intel get all that money? Well, Intel is an American company. Intel has an army of lobbyists in Washington, was instrumental in getting the CHIPS Act passed. Intel decided to locate its facilities in Ohio, a politically important place. And thus, there are questions about whether the government should, again, be giving $45 billion taxpayer dollars to a struggling company like Intel. Demsas: You’re pointing out a glut of good reasons why it’s not the most optimally efficient policy. But it seems obvious to me, at least, that it’s important for us to make semiconductors here or at least friendshore them. Is there an alternative way to do this? Lincicome: Yeah. Sure. Well, let me say one more thing about TSMC’s [fabrication facility], and then we’ll move onto your question. The other problem—and the thing I’m worried about—is that we’re actually not subsidizing bleeding-edge technology. TSMC’s fab that’ll be up and running next year is going to be very small, relative to its factories in Taiwan, and it’s not going to be producing the tippy-top-most innovative chip. It’s going to be producing four-nanometer chips instead of the industry two. It’s also insanely costly. Apparently, it’s costing about 50 percent more to build. And then, of course, a lot of other chip companies that aren’t TSMC are getting money, too, and not just Intel. And they’re getting money to produce what we call legacy chips. So these are clunky commodity chips that really have no security or even, really, innovative nexus. So I think we should be concerned. I don’t know the answer yet. You know, it’s still early in the ballgame, but there are some warning signs. Now, what could we do instead? A lot, because the big reason why companies weren’t producing a lot of chips here—although that’s a bit of a myth. About half of all chips consumed by American companies were still made in America before the CHIPS Act. But beyond that, we did lose some bleeding-edge capacity. Now, why did that happen? No. 1 reason is because of Intel. Intel was at the frontier and then totally botched it at 10 nanometers and has just become extremely behind the curve. So it’s just a corporate decision-making thing, nothing related to industrial policy. But the other big reason is because it costs a darn fortune to build a semiconductor facility in the United States. Now, some of that is just because we’re the United States. Things are more expensive than in a developing country. But a lot of it is permitting issues and materials issues and immigration issues. The semiconductor industry is one of the most immigrant-dependent industries in the United States. So tax issues, as well—we tax the construction of large structures at a much higher rate than we tax things like software and the rest. So you combine all these things, and there’s a free-market path to encouraging the onshoring of large manufacturing facilities, whether it’s semiconductors or anything else, and you could have tax reform and immigration reform and trade reform. Maybe we don’t put tariffs on construction materials and steel and everything else. So that’s a big part of it. And to the extent even that didn’t do the job, then you could see a role for the government to provide a targeted subsidy for national-security-related chips, so things our Defense Department needs or the tippy-tippy-bleeding-edge stuff that we need for, like, government supercomputers and the rest. But we didn’t get that. You know, that’s maybe a $5 billion bill. And, instead, we got this $60 billion—and then plus another $200 billion in potential tax credit—slush fund that just goes to anything and everything. So I think that’s a problem. And that’s a problem with industrial policy. What starts out as maybe a decent idea on paper just morphs into kind of a political albatross. Demsas: The only argument that I’ve seen that defends broad-based tariffs—because very few people will defend the, like, 60 percent tariff on goods from China, 20 percent on everything else the U.S. imports. I don’t think we even grow bananas. Even stuff we don’t actually make, no industries—coffee, stuff like that. But the one argument I have heard is that, while you don’t see increases in domestic manufacturing from these smaller tariffs, if you were to do this really broad-based tariff, it would just force industries to invest in the American economy, because American demand is just both lucrative but also, it would just reshape how capital markets thought about where to invest in companies. It would reshape the kinds of entrepreneurship that would happen, because now we do have to figure out how to satiate this American demand that they’ve been priced out of buying these cheaper goods from abroad. So setting aside the question about whether or not that would be good for the American consumer to have to now pay double or triple or whatever it is for these basic goods, why wouldn’t that work? Or what do you think would happen in a world where you actually saw these massive tariffs? You can go even higher. Like, you can say 60 percent tariffs on all goods outside the United States. What would actually happen here? Lincicome: Yeah. So basically North Korea, right? And I joke, but the reality is that tariffs also come with a deadweight loss, an economic loss in terms of economic growth and the rest. Yes. The United States is a big, diverse country with a very productive workforce and a lot of smart people and wonderful capital markets. But if you started imposing giant tariff walls, you’d have a few problems—the biggest being slower economic growth. By pushing workers into less productive industries, you would effectively be ensuring that the workforce, as a whole, is less productive. That means lower wages, less innovation outside of the sectors you’re targeting, right? You would push a lot of workers and resources into lower-value production. And let’s just leave aside the fact that you’d need giant greenhouses for bananas and stuff like that. We’ll leave that out. Demsas: Or we just don’t have bananas. No bananas. Yeah. Lincicome: Right. Heaven forbid. But I do think that’s the other thing that you would have to also consider. You would not just have lower economic growth and slower wages, but I think non-financially, it’d be a lower quality of life. And the grocery store is a wonderful example of that. I can remember back in the 1980s, the grocery store was not nearly as incredible as it is today. And a lot of that, today, is owed to open trade, globalization. And you would lose some of that. You would lose the variety and some of the things that make our lives richer. And I don’t just, by the way, mean bananas. And I don’t just mean food, although that’s a big one. We have this big globalization series going on. And we talk about fashion and film, and you can go down and on and on down the list. And there’s a lot of aspects of trade and open markets that make our lives fuller and richer in ways that aren’t just about where we’re working or how much we’re making, right? And so that would mean a little less, if not a lot less, of that too. I mentioned at the beginning those cool European and Asian pickup trucks we don’t get. Well, we wouldn’t get those either. We would just have fewer varieties of those things, even if, let’s assume prices are a little bit higher. Sure. But we just also wouldn’t have the variety. Demsas: I agree with you on this, but then it also gets to a point where sometimes I’m talking to people, and I realize there’s a difference in value. Some people don’t care about this, or they think it’s less important. They think that if we could get more manufacturing jobs in the United States, then it’s okay for us not to have bananas. It’s okay for us not to have a great variety of trucks. Is that stuff important? And I wonder, doesn’t this fall then down to political value judgment about what kind of world looks best? Lincicome: Yeah—yes and no, because I think if you started saying things like, Well, would you accept less medical innovation? Would you accept less scientific innovation outside of that? because resources are finite—so I think that if you gave people the fuller picture of the price of autarky, I think they would recoil. Particularly if you added things like, And also, your 401(k) is going to be smaller. Your houses are going to be smaller, there’s going to be less resiliency, not more. You might remember the baby-formula crisis, right? Well, we made all baby formula in the United States, except—because of protectionism. We had walls— tariff wall, non-tariff wall—around the country. Ninety-eight percent of baby formula consumed here was made here. We had a one factory closure, and the entire supply chain collapsed for a year. So you would have actually a more brittle economy than a more resilient one. We would not, at the end of the day, enjoy the much lower living standards, overall, just because we had a few more manufacturing jobs that people don’t even want. [Music] Demsas: We’re going to take a quick break. More with Scott when we get back. [Break] Demsas: Something you mentioned earlier on I always think is interesting is: The connection between tariff loving and immigration hating I always find very bizarre. We’re at low unemployment right now, so if you’re trying to spur more people to work in domestic manufacturing, it means you’re moving people out of other industries to work towards manufacturing. And if you have the kind of broad-based tariffs that are being proposed by the Trump-Vance ticket—I mean, they’re proposing, like, 60 percent on goods from China and up to 20 percent on everything else from the U.S. imports. These are massive, massive tariffs. That sort of thing means that you’re going to have the U.S. producing a ton more of the goods that Americans consume. And that would indicate that you would want more people coming here and working here. But at the same time, they’re opposed to immigration. So why do you think the anti-immigration and pro-tariff sentiments have gone hand in hand? They’re trying to deport millions of people too. I forgot about that. Lincicome: Nationalist sentiment, right? Look—I don’t think there’s a lot of logic or coherence in most economic nationalist arguments. And I think this is just a great example of it, for the reason you said, right? This isn’t 2014 anymore. Native-born employment has flatlined. We are an economy that needs more workers if it wants to grow at the rates we have grown accustomed to in the past. And that means we’re going to need just warm bodies. Just in terms of warm bodies, we’re going to need more of them. And obviously, immigration is a great source. I mean, babies are great, too, but they take at least 18 years to become workers, right? So we can’t do that tomorrow—at least, not that I’m aware of. I don’t know what the science is doing— Demsas: Latest technology? I think it’s still 18 years. Lincicome: Right. So we’re going to have a while on that. So immigrants are the obvious source for, you know—if we’re going to be making toasters in America again, like J.D. Vance wants, we’re going to need workers to do that. And robots are great, but robots can’t fill the gap entirely, particularly, again, in the near term. So there’s a huge disconnect there. And the other thing I’d note is that native-born Americans, in general, just don’t want to work in manufacturing. And this is something totally missed. We at Cato did a very expansive poll over the summer, asking people all sorts of questions. One of the questions we asked was a two-parter: One, Do you think the U.S. should have more manufacturing jobs? And it was, like, 80 percent yes. Yes. More people should work in manufacturing. Then we said, Do you want to work in manufacturing? And it was, like, 20 percent said yes. It’s almost the exact flip. There was a great article in Bloomberg a couple of years ago about furniture manufacturing here in North Carolina, talking about how they can’t find workers. And this was pre-pandemic, so it’s certainly gotten worse since then. You look at—the textile-manufacturing jobs in South Carolina pay $11 an hour to start. These are not the glamorous jobs that a lot of our politicians think they are. So to the extent we want these jobs in the United States, I am ambivalent. I want the market to determine that. Big surprise. They’re just going to have to come to the reality that we’re going to need more workers to do that. And, again, immigration’s the source. But there is another thing that I think the nationalists miss entirely, is that free trade actually can help reduce some of the immigration pressures in places like Central America, for example, because it’s going to boost the local economies and boost the stability of these places. Because a lot of immigration is that push-pull, right? People are living in terrible places. They’re like, I got to get the heck out of here. But also, the U.S. economy’s pulling them in. So to the extent that a trade agreement—and allowing companies to access the U.S. market to sell us shirts and stuff like that—can actually boost the local economies in places like, say, Guatemala, that’s going to actually reduce some of that push pressure on immigration, legal or otherwise. And there’s a fantastic study that actually showed everything I just said, most recently, and it said that you could reduce illegal border crossings by several hundred thousand if you had truly free trade with Central America for textiles, for the reasons I just described. So is that a panacea for the border issues? No. But would it help? Yes. And it is completely lost on our anti-immigration, anti-trade folks, the idea that trading more with places would actually reduce some pressures for more immigrants. They just want no trade and no immigrants, which just doesn’t make a lot of sense. Demsas: I want to get into some of the reasons for why tariffs haven’t been able to increase domestic manufacturing. There’s a really great study. Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce at the Fed—I hope, Aaron, I’m saying your last name correctly. I apologize if not. And they had this study where they looked at the Trump tariffs—the 2018, 2019 tariffs—and they find that the U.S. industries most exposed to tariff increases experienced reductions in employment. And they also find that counties more exposed to rising tariffs show increases in unemployment—more people are unemployed in counties that are more exposed to rising tariffs—and, of course, declines in labor-force participation. So people are just exiting the labor force entirely there. Why is that happening? Because why is even this narrow case of tariffs—they’re big tariffs, but they’re nothing like they’re being proposed now—why did that not improve domestic manufacturing? Lincicome: Right. For the moment, let’s just leave aside that the vast majority of us work in services. And if you work in services, you’re basically hurt by tariffs, regardless of anything. Demsas: Okay. This is one of my hobbyhorses, that whenever everyone talks about the working class, we pretend like everyone’s a manufacturer, but really everyone’s in the service industry, and it’s like, No one cares about those people. McDonald’s? Don’t care about them. It’s just bizarre. Lincicome: It’s crazy. Even for male-dominated professions—because we’re all worried about men not working and stuff—there are four times as many male-dominated, blue-collar jobs in services than there are in manufacturing. And we never talk about any of it, like you said. Whether it’s construction or security or repair, like automotive repair, you name it, there’s tons of jobs. Nobody talks about them. But anyway, we’re going to ignore all of those folks. Demsas: Just like our political leaders. Lincicome: Right. We’re going to ignore them. Sorry. Sorry, folks. We can get back to them later. Manufacturing—there’s three big reasons why tariffs actually harm American manufacturing. The first is that American manufacturing today is very much global. About half of everything we import into the United States is actually stuff used by American manufacturers to make other stuff—things like steel or machinery and semiconductors. The huge example of that is: The most advanced semiconductor-production technology comes from the Netherlands. We import that equipment to support semiconductor production in the United States, right? Demsas: These are intermediate goods. Lincicome: Yeah—intermediate. Oh, look at you! Nice. Yes. Exactly. Demsas: (Laughs.) Lincicome: When people use trade wonky terms, I’m always impressed. That’s great. So all these intermediate goods—you raise the price of those goods, which tariffs do, and you raise costs for manufacturers. That means those manufacturers spend less on employment and investment and the rest. You’re just raising their costs. It’s like a corporate tax but only for manufacturers that consume imports, which, again, is most of them. The second big channel is the export side, and that is through retaliation. Foreign governments typically don’t just sit there after a tariff is imposed on products they’re exporting and say, Oh, you got us. We’re toast. No. They retaliate. And they retaliate because they have their own domestic political considerations. They have strategic considerations about preventing even more tariffs. So that harms American manufacturers that export—American manufacturers that are already hurt because they’re facing higher import costs. So those companies are getting hit two ways: higher input costs and retaliation. The third channel is currency, and I won’t get into the weeds, but tariffs tend to increase the value of the domestic currency. So the dollar gets stronger. As the dollar gets stronger, there’s a good thing: That means that imports get a little cheaper. So it’ll offset some of that tariff pain. The bad thing is that it makes exports more expensive, and anybody who’s gone abroad and has a really strong dollar knows you can buy a ton abroad. That’s actually an import. You’re getting cheap imports. But if the dollar gets really weak and you go abroad, it’s the opposite. So just kind of think of it—it’s kind of those mechanisms, right? So those three channels, effectively, eliminate any benefit that manufacturers might get from tariff protection. And thus, like you said, the literature tends to show that countries with higher tariffs don’t have wonderful trade surpluses or burgeoning manufacturing industries. And in the United States, the empirical research from the Trump era shows much the same thing. Demsas: You’ve talked about the narrow cases in which tariffs make sense to you, which I think, largely, is around national security. But I think once you accept that logic, then it just becomes a political question about what things people value, right? There is this sense that people really care about protecting the manufacturing legacy of specific areas in the United States. And this is, I think, a legacy of 2016, when a lot of people were surprised by the victory of Donald Trump to the presidency. There was a lot of indexing on the fact that he won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania and seeing that this narrative—that he really spoke to the white working class who had been disaffected by free trade. And this, of course, is right when the “China Shock” paper is becoming really central to the discourse. And so there’s a level here where I wonder if there’s a political-narrative thing that’s going on here, too, where, regardless of all the stuff that we’re talking about, if people want to win national elections, is this just necessary? Lincicome: No. I’m a firm believer that a lot of what’s going on with our protectionist moment right now is political. The conventional wisdom in Washington today is that, to win national elections, you need to win a handful of gettable votes—so Obama–Trump voters, basically, people who flipped—in a handful of important places, mainly in the industrial Midwest. And to win those votes, you need to offer lots of protectionism and industrial policy too—manufacturing-centric policy. And I think that is the reality—the conventional wisdom is. I think that is the case. I don’t necessarily agree with it, but I’m not a political consultant, so I won’t dare to question it. And there was a good paper recently by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, another person—the “China Shock” authors—that said that Republicans did gain a little bit in places, thanks to the tariffs. Even though those places didn’t actually benefit economically, the tariffs were a political winner for Republicans, thanks to the idea that they were being protected. They weren’t actually being protected. The economy was actually a little worse. But they thought they were, and they were rewarding politicians for that. So I think that is the case. And it’s unfortunate because, first, I am not entirely convinced that tariffs and protectionism were what tipped the 2016 election. There’s a lot of other stuff bubbling under the surface. But the other big thing is: You actually look at the effect of import competition on these places pre-Trump, and it’s not nearly as devastating as the narrative makes it sound. Whether it’s the China Shock or NAFTA or anything else, these things undoubtedly had a small but significant negative effect on certain places, but it was small. There’s a lot of bigger things going on in terms of manufacturing job loss, in terms of communities surviving or dying. There’s a great study a few years ago from Brookings that found that, like, 80 percent of old industrial cities in the United States had transitioned to successful economies—places like Pittsburgh. So not every place ended up being like Youngstown, Ohio, right? Yet there’s this narrative that it was all trade, and every place got crushed. And that’s just not the reality, you know? And the other thing we ignore entirely is interstate competition. A lot of the jobs in the Rust Belt manufacturing—they’re still in the United States. They’re just not in the Rust Belt anymore. They’re in the Sun Belt. We don’t talk about that at all, either. It is all trade, trade, trade. And I think that’s really unfortunate. At the end of the day, what does that do? It means that the real solutions—and there are a lot of policies that could be pursued to help people adjust, to give them better training and education, to help them move if they need to move by lowering housing prices (you know all about that)—we don’t do any of those. Or, at least, we don’t focus on those. Instead, it’s like, Ah. We’ll just slap a tariff on a toaster, and suddenly Youngstown will be thriving again. And that’s just not reality, not just in the literature. It just doesn’t make any sense. But that’s politics for you, right? Demsas: Yeah. Yeah. I also think that one of the things that I wanted to get your—because you’ve thought about this for years as someone who’s working in trade. The political dynamics of tariffs, I think, are really important to understand. I think, broadly, my question for you is: Why are tariffs so popular if they’re so harmful? What is going on that, if you’re right, it’s creating all these problems, from baby-formula shortages, which is extremely politically costly, other kinds of shortages during the pandemic—very, very costly. If it’s leading to lower growth—all this stuff—what’s happening? Why doesn’t the political party just win 300 electoral votes by campaigning against tariffs? Lincicome: Right. Because they are extremely politically attractive to voters. There’s a guy named Bryan Caplan who wrote a wonderful book several years ago called The Myth of the Rational Voter. He’s a George Mason economist, libertarian guy. But this is more political-science oriented. He ticks through a bunch of biases we all have. And bias is kind of a bad connotation, but I don’t mean it that way. I just mean things that we innately feel. And tariffs check all of the boxes: an anti-foreign bias, a make-work bias. We like things that produce jobs, right? We have a status-quo bias. Like, we want to protect things that we see that are right in front of us. We are less inclined to want the unseen or the things we don’t know. We can, in fact, fear them. You can go down the list, and tariffs check all of those boxes. So that’s the first thing. Voters innately think, Oh, that’s great. You’re going to protect jobs with that tariff. Wonderful. But beyond that, the economics of tariffs are hard. It is counterintuitive that a tariff might actually reduce manufacturing output, right? It is counterintuitive, I think, that a trade deficit isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It sounds terrible, right? And it’s counterintuitive that if you cut imports, you actually cut exports too. So there’s all these little things in trade economics that make it a hard sell. And then, finally: It’s opaque. I mentioned before, when you go to the gas station, you see how prices change. So even some voters that are somewhat connected to the news can be like, Oh, wow. There’s this new conflict with Iran and Israel, and gas prices are going to go up. I get that connection. You don’t really get that with tariffs. Demsas: So you need a tariff ticker in grocery stores to show— Lincicome: Yes. I’ve actually long said we need—just the gas station ticker, you need that as well. I think that if you got a receipt from the grocery store and a lot of the line items was the tariff amount, I think that probably would change a few minds. And then, finally, the other thing is that tariffs are oftentimes a corporate tax, and corporate taxes can be hidden. They can either be absorbed by companies or passed on to consumers, again, in invisible ways. And that makes it hard too. So it’s a very, very tough sell. Now, I’ll note: We’ve known everything I just said for decades, if not centuries. And politicians came up with a fix. It’s called a trade agreement. Trade agreements are not, contrary to popular belief, primarily economic or even about foreign policy. They’re primarily political. There are ways for governments to tie their own hands when it comes to tariff policy. They’re like, I can’t be trusted with this. We went through Smoot-Hawley and all these other bad tariff episodes. We can’t be trusted with guiding tariff policy. So we’re going to delegate it all to the president, which, by the way, that was not the best idea, given Trump. But beyond that, we’re entering into agreements that essentially say that if we go back on our promises, well, what happens? Then the countries we’re trading with can retaliate, there can be litigation and the rest. And that can act as a check. The other big thing is: We’re going to offset import-competing industries. We’re going to offset their political power with exporters, and trade agreements are going to do that too. Because that’s the other political attractiveness, right? Concentrated benefits and diffuse costs. The benefits of protectionism are very narrow, like the steel industry. Costs of protection are diffused. We all bear those little costs—again, an invisible cost. So how do you offset that? Well, a trade agreement does that, too, because you have exporters that are like, Oh, but I want access to that market. And I don’t just mean Boeing. I mean financial services and other companies. And so that was the political solution. Now, trade agreements have problems, but they were reasonably successful for 80 years in liberalizing trade, integrating economies, and checking the protectionist impulses of our political class. It was only in the last decade that Donald Trump hacked the whole machine. And we’re basically dealing with the aftermath. Demsas: Yeah. This diffuse-benefits, concentrated-cost thing—I think it’s just so key. Also, because even after the political constituency has died, it’s kind of hard—in general, once a law gets passed, it’s really durable. Repealing that law, on not just tariff policy but all policies—it kind of just lives on its own. It develops a constituency, whether it’s in the government or outside the government, that wants its continuation. And there’s also very few people who are going to make their political hobbyhorse to do good-governance reforms. But I write about housing policy a lot. And it’s funny—everyone is talking about housing policy now. Everyone’s talking about how to reduce the cost of housing, make it easier to do construction, all this sort of thing. I’ll have people who are in the Democratic Party or in the administration saying things like, Jerusalem, we need to lower costs. We need innovative ways for the federal government to do this. It’s really hard. It’s all at state and local level. And I’ll often just say, Hey. Did you guys know there are, like, massive tariffs on Canadian lumber, on Canadian softwood lumber? And they doubled those tariffs in August. And there’s none of this thinking about the diffuse costs to the American people. Like, Congress isn’t working on fixing that. It’s just a level at which I believe that they all care about lowering the cost of housing. I think that’s not a fake thing that they’re talking about here. But we don’t even think about tariff policy when we’re thinking about broad economic costs to the public. We only think about them narrowly in the question of, How does it hurt or benefit this specific industry? and not, What is the harm to the rest of the public? Lincicome: For sure. And every time you bring up potentially lifting the tariffs that are in place, what happens? Well, big lumber comes to your congressional office or big dairy when the—the dairy industry in the United States, highly protected. When the baby-formula thing was going down, they were vigorously opposing a long-term elimination of the tariffs on baby formula. Now, think about that for a second: baby formula. And these guys are out there, big dairy is out there fighting it. And it worked. Congress has not eliminated those tariffs, even though it’s the most sympathetic consumer possible, right? Demsas: And it was broadly unpopular. It’s very unpopular, what happened with the baby formula. Lincicome: Exactly. And every time you scratch a tariff, there’s a crony underneath, and they’re going to fight like heck to keep their windfall profits. And they’re paying attention. They’re editing Wikipedia pages to make the protectionism sound better. They are the ones laser focused on keeping the protection in place, while the rest of us are like, Well, five cents for some food that’s subject to a tariff, a few dollars here and there extra for a refrigerator or washing machine. Oh, well. But that stuff adds up, of course. Studies show that if you eliminated all of the protectionism that’s remaining in the U.S. economy—and we’re a pretty open economy—you would save consumers hundreds of dollars a year, if not more. And yet, because it is 10 cents here and 10 cents there, it just doesn’t resonate. And the other side is extremely motivated. Demsas: Well, thank you so much, Scott. I have one last question for you. And it’s: What’s an idea that you had that seemed good at the time but turned out to only be good on paper? Lincicome: Yeah. I struggled with this question. Demsas: Because you’ve always been right? Yeah. (Laughs.) Lincicome: Well, no, no, no. Because I wanted to find a good one. Self-checkout is my answer. Demsas: Oh, yeah? Lincicome: Yeah. I am a huge fan of self-checkout. And being me, I’m also a big fan of just efficiency, right? Waiting in line is terrible. I wrote a whole column about why you should never wait in line, because of the opportunity cost of doing so. So self-checkout—in theory, self-checkout is this amazing life hack. And I still love it, but I’m realizing that—let’s face it—and companies are realizing that self-checkout is not nearly the labor-saving, time-saving miracle that we think. And that’s because humans, alas, are still human. And for every guy like me who literally treats it like I’m trying to beat my best time ever at Costco when I’m going through the self-check—my daughter’s, like, handing me stuff. I mean, we’re literally gamifying it. It’s so great. Demsas: This is how I feel in the airport security line. I get so angry. Lincicome: For every person like me, who’s trying to get out of there as soon as possible and trying to break his own personal record, there are, like, 74 other people who are utterly confused by the technology, in no rush, wanting to maybe chat with the person behind the counter, wanting to pay by a check, confused by their coupons, or trying to steal. That’s the other big thing. And so, unfortunately, it has turned out that self-check is not the miracle technology that I was hoping. So it looked good on paper but less so in reality. Demsas: There’s a Safeway near my house. I moved recently, so I was checking out the nearby grocery stores. And the self-checkout is, like, I don’t know, an armed state. It’s so insane. You can’t exit the checkout without scanning your receipt. And I usually just throw my receipt away immediately, so I had to go get the receipt out of the trash. It wasn’t even functioning. Someone had to come and let me out and then look at all my stuff and make sure I wasn’t stealing. It was just this level of just—it genuinely would have taken me so much less time to wait in this line. But every time, I still go to the self-check. I don’t know why I’m doing it to myself. Lincicome: Of course. No. And I have a dream of opening up my own supermarket where we actually time people, and there’s, like, posted records of all this. But no. Alas, it still runs into problems. Demsas: Well, Scott, thank you so much for coming on the show. Lincicome: My pleasure. Thanks for having me. Great talk. [Music] Demsas: Good on Paper is produced by Jinae West.

Title: It’s the Most Hated Airline in America. You’ll Miss It When It’s Gone.

Full Content:
Not long ago, I found myself in a position every American air traveler is taught to dread: I was about to board a Spirit Airlines flight. Spirit Flight 492 was scheduled to take me from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, not far from the carrier’s headquarters, to Columbus, Ohio, where I was living at the time. My wife and I were flying home from a wedding in South Florida, and Spirit was the easy choice and the cheapest choice. It was also the choice that allowed me to avoid Miami International Airport, one of the few on-ground places I hate more than being in the air. As a perpetually anxious flyer, I dreaded getting on any plane that could make my nerves even worse. Would the horror stories prove true? Would I be able to move in my seat? Would I have to take out my credit card for water? If there were a problem with the flight, would I be trapped in Florida forever? These were not entirely out-of-pocket questions. To understand Spirit Airlines is to understand what it is to be hated—truly despised—by most people. One recent Axios–Harris Poll survey asked Americans about the brand reputations of 100 well-known companies. Spirit ranked 98th out of 100 companies—worse than Meta and TikTok, Fox Corporation, and Silicon Valley Bank, a financial institution that failed last year. The only businesses that scored worse? Elon Musk’s X and the Trump Organization. Woof. Spirit’s brand is synonymous with cheapness—in price but also in quality. Its planes are cramped, uncomfortable, and all too often delayed. The airline sets cheap rates but ambushes customers with pesky little fees for every single facet of the flying experience, a nickel-and-diming scheme that bends not even for that glass of water. It’s flying “unbundled”: Start with the worst experience imaginable, then pay up for whatever shreds of dignity you need to feel human. This was actually the reason I decided to board the Spirit flight. Despite my nerves, I was excited to see what all the hate was about. My curiosity had been piqued earlier this year, after Spirit got a hearty endorsement from an unlikely source: a federal judge. On Jan. 14, William Young, a Ronald Reagan–appointed federal district judge in Boston, sided with the U.S. Department of Justice and blocked JetBlue’s proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit, a deal that would have allowed two discount airlines that fell on hard times in the COVID pandemic to merge and leverage more power against the so-called Big Four: American, Delta, Southwest, and United. In his opinion, waxing poetic about the beleaguered Spirit, Young wrote that the merger was incompatible with federal antitrust laws, which are aimed at protecting the American consumer from harmful corporate combinations—especially when they raise prices. A combined JetBlue and Spirit would have created the fifth-largest airline in the country, controlling 10 percent of the domestic market. It wasn’t to be. “Spirit is a small airline. But there are those who love it,” Young wrote, explaining why he had sided with the DOJ. “To those dedicated customers of Spirit, this one’s for you. Why? Because the Clayton Act, a 109-year-old statute requires this result—a statute that continues to deliver for the American people,” he added, referring to the longtime antitrust law. Let’s raise a glass to the cheapskate of the sky, the judge seemed to say—the everyman of the flying world, the great equalizer of the skies. Ever since the merger failed, Spirit’s stock has tanked, and its market value has slipped from $6 billion in 2015 to comparative pennies today. Speculation of a collapse has been rampant, and news that Spirit would delay the purchase of more planes and would be cutting certain routes followed. Then, earlier this month, “people familiar with the matter” told the Wall Street Journal that the airline is indeed in negotiations ahead of a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. So wait: If Spirit’s passengers are miserable—and if onlookers at neighboring gates are smirking stupidly, safe in the knowledge that they don’t have the misfortune of flying that dreaded airline, as I swear I experienced in Florida—what makes it so good for people? Why should those Delta flyers with shit-eating grins be grateful for pathetic little Spirit? As I boarded the plane that day, I wanted to know if Young had been onto something. As it turned out, almost every expert on air travel I spoke to agreed: If Spirit does perish, you will miss it. You just don’t know how much it’s already done for you. Spirit was founded in 1964 as a Michigan-based trucking company. It didn’t get into air travel until 1980, when it began operating domestic flights as Charter One Airlines. In the 1990s, it rebranded as Spirit Airlines and relocated from the Detroit suburbs to sunny Miramar, Florida, between Miami and Fort Lauderdale. It wasn’t until 2007 that Spirit became what’s called an “ultra-low-cost carrier,” a business model first pioneered by the Irish airline Ryanair in the ’90s. (This is a step down from a low-cost carrier, such as Southwest Airlines or JetBlue.) Though their models vary somewhat, ULCCs typically offer fully “unbundled” fares. What you see when you buy a ticket online is merely a base fare, and everything else comes at a price. Literally everything else: not only now-familiar extra costs like bag fees, but also any snack or sip of water on board, a fee for seats if you want a guaranteed seat next to a travel partner, and even an additional charge for printing a ticket at the airport. Such airlines’ devious definition of ancillary services kept expanding, and so did the revenue they earned from them, often catching less seasoned travelers off guard. Gerald Cook, an adjunct professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, is a former commercial pilot and flight operations manager who flew for Spirit from 1999 to 2010. He said that before Spirit began unbundling its fees, it was struggling and fairly directionless. “It was hard to say what the business model was,” Cook told me. When Ben Baldanza became the CEO in 2005, he transformed Spirit into a ULCC and, within a few years, made it the most profitable airline in the United States. (Baldanza left Spirit in 2016 and is now a board member at JetBlue.) “It was successful enough that we changed to an all-Airbus fleet. We had a new fleet of airplanes,” Cook said. “The downside under Baldanza was he concentrated so much on aircraft utilization that the reliability and on-time performance was poor.” (Aircraft utilization refers to how many hours a plane flies per day.) Baldanza was proud of the cheapo transformation, calling his airline the “dollar store of the sky.” Seeing Spirit’s success, Frontier Airlines, a regional carrier sold by Republic Airways in 2013, followed its lead and became a ULCC too. Spirit went public in 2011 and expanded rapidly in the years after. Baldanza resigned in 2016, with a $1 million golden parachute and a lifetime of free Spirit flights, and the company has fallen consistently each year for a decade, leading to its current predicament. Cook thinks it grew too fast, taking on too much debt, which left it vulnerable to the pandemic. The company was forced to take out billions in debt during the height of the crisis, from which it has struggled to recover. Cue the merger talks. Frontier itself attempted to buy Spirit for $2.9 billion in a stock-and-cash deal in February 2022, but shareholders rejected the merger mere months later. JetBlue swooped in for Spirit with a $3.8 billion deal, which shareholders OK’d in October 2022. That led to an antitrust battle with the suit from the Justice Department, which culminated in Judge Young’s decision quashing the merger earlier this January. What did Young see in Spirit that the average American air traveler doesn’t? Unlike many of the legacy airlines that carve out specific areas of coverage, Spirit does something incredibly important: It truly competes with every other airline. And that brings down prices for every airline passenger—whether you deign to fly Spirit or not. William McGee, a senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project, was a vocal critic of the merger deal. He told me that ULCCs like Spirit are the only real competition for the big carriers—the one thing that actually reduces their prices. In his opinion, Young hailed the so-called Spirit effect: “Spirit has found that, typically, once Spirit enters a route, passenger demand increases and the average fare on that route decreases.” McGee told me that there are “two Americas”: cities with Spirit, and cities without it. Research has found that Spirit’s entry into a marketplace lowers fares in nearly every case. For example, a 2016 study documented a Houston–to–Kansas City route that was serviced only by United Airlines. Tickets on average went for $300—until 2014, when Spirit also began to service the route. Spirit offered fares closer to $90, and United was forced to bring the average fare down to $180, according to the study. This effect was seen again and again in routes across the country. “If the JetBlue merger had gone through, I can guarantee you that the following Monday morning, fares would be much higher on American and United—because American and United have this mosquito bothering them,” McGee said. “That’s how the big guys look at them. They’ll do everything they can to squash them.” It’s hard to directly analyze how the airlines compete because they’re often after different kinds of customers, said Kevin Williams, a professor of economics at Yale University. “To many people, JetBlue and Spirit have pretty different operations,” he said. “They have very different products. They’re presumably going after very different customers.” Still, by going full cheapo, the legacy carriers are able to compete more directly for cost-conscious flyers. You can see the effects of Spirit’s competition when you travel with a legacy carrier. If you’ve flown Basic Economy on American, Delta, or United—that lowest option where you cannot select your seat, you board last, and even if you have loyalty membership you’re not eligible for upgrades—you can thank Spirit. But Basic Economy is still often a higher price point than Spirit’s base fare, even with a few add-ons. In that way, Spirit offers access to a customer segment that, without those cheaper-than-cheap flights, might drive instead of fly, or might not take a trip at all. “Spirit is basically the only choice for lower-income Americans on routes,” McGee said. “For a lot of people, it’s a question of whether or not you’re gonna see your grandparents, or the grandparents are gonna see their grandkids. If Spirit’s not there, then they’re not going.” Even for the people who do shell out for the more expensive flight rather than Spirit, the benefit is still there. If you’re traveling on a route Spirit also services, you can bet you saved money from the mere fact that it was an option. In Fort Lauderdale, I boarded a good-as-new Airbus A320neo wrapped in Spirit’s signature black-and-yellow design, and I must report: It was totally fine. That is the experience of the vast majority of people who fly Spirit. It is fine—excellent safety, capable air crews, planes that are clean and well maintained, if not exactly comfortable. Indeed, on board, the jet-black seats were thinly padded and deeply uncomfortable, but otherwise the major new annoyance of the flying experience involved taking out my credit card to pay for a snack. By now, many consumers are aware that’ll happen on Spirit. But some, especially less experienced flyers, have no idea. And they certainly don’t know what’ll happen if their plans change. Then you’ll have to find out just how seriously Spirit takes its “nonrefundable” fares. If you search Spirit online, you can see the results: The Better Business Bureau and Consumer Affairs pages for the airline are littered with reviews claiming “terrible,” “unprofessional,” and “fraudulent” practices. A common refrain: Never again. Furious customers have even turned to Yelp, typically where you go to gripe about a soggy taco or brusque waiter, to lash out at the airline, which currently sits at 1.4 stars out of 5. The accusations are myriad, but many boil down to the same complaint: They had a problem, and when they contacted customer service, Spirit told them exactly where they could shove it. By 2013, Spirit’s reputation had gotten to the point where it inspired a classic Onion headline: “FAA Report: Spirit Airlines Is the Fucking Worst.” To Spirit, this is a feature, not a bug. The airline declined to make any executives available for interviews for this article, but in the past, top executives at the company have been almost gleeful in enforcing its rules at any cost. There was the time when a customer complained that a flight delay to Atlanta (fare: $78) had caused him to miss a concert and demanded damages. Baldanza mistakenly—or not—replied all to a customer service thread: “We owe him nothing as far as I’m concerned. Let him tell the world how bad we are. He’s never flown us before anyway and will be back when we save him a penny.” Then there was the time, as recounted in the Wall Street Journal, that a 76-year-old Vietnam veteran found out he had terminal cancer and was told not to fly. Too bad, Spirit told the dying veteran: “Nonrefundable’s nonrefundable, and that’s it.” Only after a national campaign on Facebook and television coverage did Spirit budge, but even then, only kind of: The airline never issued a refund, but Baldanza paid the man back out of his own pocket, and Spirit made an undisclosed donation to a veterans group. The current Spirit CEO, longtime executive Ted Christie, has been more magnanimous in public—he acknowledged the chaos mass cancellations caused in 2019, for example—but Spirit’s foundational unwillingness to give in to customers who feel wronged has not noticeably shifted. The reason why—and the reason to be sympathetic, even if you have been personally screwed by Spirit—is that Spirit and its ilk believe themselves to be the only airlines genuinely trying to shake up the flying market and make it better for everyone, customers and investors alike. On this point, Christie has been far more outspoken. After the merger with JetBlue was blocked, he declared on an earnings call, “The Big Four are the beneficiaries of this new normal. American consumers are the long-term losers.” He said the American airline industry “seems ever more like a rigged game.” Judge Young, in his opinion, seemed to agree with Spirit in, er, spirit—the ultra-low-cost carrier has been a boon for competition in an industry the Atlantic earlier this year called “dangerously consolidated.” But the decision in effect has threatened its existence. So while the pugnaciousness of Spirit can feel anti-customer, there’s also something pious in the bad blood it’s willing to endure. As the bankruptcy looms, we may soon find out what a world without Spirit—or a much different Spirit—looks like. Plenty of customers who have been wronged over the years will probably cheer the news when it comes. At least until they have to book their flights home for Thanksgiving next year and see the prices. In the end, my biggest mistake was that I spent too much money on Spirit. The one-way flight for two cost me $343.64. I paid for a so-called Just For You bundle, which included a checked bag, shortcut boarding, and the ability to pick my seat. That was another $120. I paid an additional $34 to upgrade my seats to ones in an exit aisle with extra legroom. And since we had a long weekend of wedding travel that took us from Ohio to Maryland to Florida, we had a lot of bags—some checked, some carry-on. Bringing those along cost $116. Oh, and then there was $52.54 in taxes. Once on board, I had work to do. I coughed up $15.99 for Wi-Fi—much more than most airlines charge—and $9.98 for Pringles and a can of ginger ale. My total cost: $692.15, or $346.08 per person. There’s a right way and a wrong way to do Spirit. Fly Spirit when you have minimal bags, have minimal needs, and just need to get somewhere as cheaply as possible. If you fly and expect all of the amenities of a legacy airline, you’ll be able to rebundle the total cost—and more. In my case, this was a comparable price to flying with a legacy carrier, and it didn’t require me to wait many, many hours or voyage to Miami, which would have added costs and stress. So I’m rooting for Spirit. I hope a bankruptcy doesn’t mean the end of those yellow-and-black planes next to haughty Delta and United jets. I hope any restructuring maintains the bad-mannered airline poking the others in the eye. In fact, I’m planning another trip on Spirit soon—and I’m going to do it right next time. I’m going to fly with little, ask for nothing, sit in my crappy little seat, and admire the miracle of modern commercial flight. And if I need a ginger ale, or something stronger, to settle my nerves, I’m going to appreciate that this airline of less-than-stellar repute has made flying cheaper for me for years. I can afford to throw them a buck or two for a bag of pretzels. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents © 2024 The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved.

Shares of Nvidia reached a record high on Monday, positioning the Santa Clara-based chipmaker close to surpassing Apple as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s stock rose by 2.4%, closing at $138.07, as investors continued to back strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) processors. The graphics processing units (GPUs) maker briefly held the title of the world’s most valuable company in June, before being overtaken by Microsoft. For several months, the market valuations of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple have remained competitive, with their values closely aligned. Nvidia’s recent gains brought its market value to $3.39 trillion, just trailing Apple’s $3.52 trillion, while Microsoft’s stands at $3.12 trillion, reported Reuters. Nvidia has been a significant beneficiary of the ongoing competition among leading technology companies such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon to establish dominance in the growing AI technology sector. Analysts at TD Cowen noted that the major players in AI face an environment where each is driven to invest due to the risks of being left behind. TD Cowen, in a report on Sunday, reiterated its price target of $165 for Nvidia, highlighting the company’s strong demand for its AI processors and naming it their “Top Pick.” The firm also addressed Nvidia’s recent confirmation in August regarding delays in ramping up production of its upcoming Blackwell chips until the fourth quarter. Nvidia indicated that existing processors were still in high demand. The rise in Nvidia’s shares coincided with gains for Apple and Microsoft, which saw increases of 2% and 0.7% respectively, contributing to the S&P 500 index (.SPX) reaching a record high close, up 0.8% on Monday. Together, Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft account for around 20% of the S&P 500’s weighting, substantially impacting the index’s performance. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which manufactures Nvidia’s processors, is set to release its earnings on Thursday, with analysts predicting a 40% increase in quarterly profit, driven by growing demand. Spending on AI data centres is expected to boost Nvidia’s annual revenue to nearly $126bn, according to LSEG data. Although Nvidia’s strong performance has lifted the S&P 500 to new highs, concerns remain among investors about the possibility that optimism around AI could fade if spending on the technology shows signs of slowing. In contrast to the high valuation achieved in recent days, Nvidia faced a significant setback in September as its stock decline erased $279bn in market value amid concerns about AI investments. The sharp drop was triggered by a disappointing quarterly outlook that missed investor expectations, raising worries about slower-than-expected returns on AI investments. At that time, Nvidia experienced a historic single-day loss as shares fell 9.5%, leading to a $279bn reduction in market capitalisation, marking the largest one-day decline for any US company and surpassing Meta Platforms’ $232bn loss in February 2022. For Q2 FY25, Nvidia reported a GAAP net income of $16.6bn, a 168% year-on-year increase, with total revenue reaching $30bn, up 122% from the previous year. For Q3 FY25, Nvidia forecasted revenue of approximately $32.5bn, with a potential variance of plus or minus 2%. Give your business an edge with our leading Tech Monitor

Title: F, GM, or STLA: Which Traditional Automaker Is the Best Investment Choice?

In this article, I will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to analyze traditional automakers, including Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). A closer look suggests a neutral stance on Ford, while a bullish outlook for both GM and Stellantis. However, if I had to choose one, I believe investing in General Motors is the best option compared to the other two, which I will discuss next. I have a neutral view on Ford, the legacy U.S. automaker that has undergone significant restructuring to enhance profitability and resilience amid industry volatility. However, the company’s latest results have disappointed due to ongoing quality and warranty issues, a complex transition to electric vehicles, and a general lack of investor confidence. Ford reported a significant EPS miss for Q2, coming in at 47 cents when analysts expected 68 cents. This marks the third consecutive quarter of sharp year-over-year declines, primarily driven by warranty costs. Additionally, Ford Blue, the segment focused on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, reported an adjusted EBIT of $1.2 billion, down 48% from the previous year. It should be noted that warranty costs have plagued Ford for years, affecting its reputation for quality and reliability. In 2023, the company had 5.9 million vehicles recalled, the highest of any U.S. automaker. These financial losses, coupled with rising warranty claims, suggest a troubling lack of quality in Ford’s combustion vehicles. I refrain from taking a bearish stance on Ford because there are positive developments. Promisingly, CEO Jim Farley indicated that warranty issues are expected to be resolved soon, with plans to invest in advanced technologies and improve testing protocols to significantly reduce these problems by 2025. Also, after suspending its dividend during the pandemic, Ford reinstated it in 2021, signaling confidence in its financial health and sustainable cash flow. This makes Ford attractive to income-oriented investors, with a dividend yield of 7.43% and a payout ratio of 47.5%. Valuations also favor Ford, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 5.6x, about 30% below its five-year average. At TipRanks, Wall Street consensus rates Ford as a Moderate Buy. The average price target is $14.40, suggesting a potential upside of 34.33%. I have an optimistic outlook on General Motors, one of the largest automakers and a leader in vehicle electrification, thanks to its strong sales growth and aggressive push toward electric vehicles. As a result, GM has outperformed nearly all of its competitors this year. In Q2, GM reported strong results, particularly in its internal combustion engine (ICE) trucks and SUVs, marking its eighth consecutive quarter of beating EPS estimates with $3.06 per share—a 60.2% year-over-year increase. The company achieved $4.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, up 37% from last year, prompting a $500 million increase in full-year guidance to between $13 billion and $15 billion. Much of the bullish investment thesis for General Motors hinges on its commitment to scaling Electric Vehicle (EV) initiatives. While GM previously pledged to electrify 50% of its fleet by 2030 and 100% by 2035, management now indicates that these goals will be guided by consumer demand. Moreover, I believe one reason GM stock has outperformed its peers is that the company grew revenues by nearly 5% year-over-year, compared to the industry average of 2%. Additionally, GM’s EBIT increased by 4.2%, while the industry average was just 1.8%. In contrast, peers like Ford and Stellantis reported EBIT declines of 55% and 27%, respectively. GM’s dividend yield is just under 1%, much less attractive than Ford’s. However, the company has repurchased about $11.5 billion worth of shares over the past twelve months, resulting in a buyback yield of around 21.6%, compared to 1.3% for Ford. Additionally, GM trades at a forward P/E ratio of 4.8x, nearly 40% below its historical average, despite a roughly 55% stock appreciation over the past year. At TipRanks, the Wall Street consensus rates GM as a Moderate Buy, with an average price target of $57, suggesting an upside of 19.07%. I hold a cautiously bullish view of Stellantis, which, despite poor performance this year, is undergoing a transitional period in its product cycle. Formed in 2021 from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Peugeot Groupe, Stellantis has a diverse portfolio of 14 iconic brands. Recent results have disappointed the market. After a record year in 2023 with net revenue, net profit, and free cash flow all at new highs, the company reported yearly declines of 14% in revenue and 38% in net profit for H1 2024. Concerns about Stellantis’ investment thesis stem from its transitional phase. The company plans to invest $50 billion over the next decade in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), averaging $8.3 billion annually. However, Stellantis has been consistently reporting cash operations exceeding $20 billion, providing positive free cash flow for dividends and buybacks. Despite its recent disappointing results, several factors make me optimistic that the current bearishness surrounding Stellantis could present a good entry point for investors. First, the company demonstrates strong capital efficiency with a return on total capital of 9.7%, well above the industry average of 6.1%, Ford’s 1.1%, and GM’s 3.7%. This efficiency, driven by streamlined operations and a focus on high-margin vehicles, bodes well for its transition to fleet electrification. Additionally, Stellantis offers a dividend yield of 10.4% with a payout ratio of 41.5%. However, the company plans to reduce this to a 25-30% payout ratio for 2025, likely leading to a decline in the yield. On a positive note, Stellantis’ valuation is attractive, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 4.1x, which is lower than those of Ford and GM. According to TipRanks, the Wall Street consensus rates STLA as a Moderate Buy. The average price target is $21, suggesting an upside of 61.41%. I believe GM’s current momentum inspires more confidence than that of Ford and Stellantis. Despite offering a modest dividend yield, GM delivers compelling returns to shareholders through buybacks and still trades at an attractive valuation. Furthermore, GM has significantly outperformed its peers, demonstrating robust earnings results that have led to improved annual guidance. Disclosure Disclaimer Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Taking voluntary redundancy or getting laid off? You need to know about your tax, welfare and pension options

Redundancies are common these days. Tech, pharma, finance and consulting workers know the wind can change at brutal speed. You’re sipping your free wellness smoothie one minute and out the door the next. When redundancy is in the ether, it’s good to have a financial plan. Drug giant Pfizer is the latest multinational to announce job cuts here. Some 210 of its workers will go over the next year. TikTok, Wayfair and Flutter announced cuts earlier this year. It was Accenture before that, with 890 redundancies announced last year. This followed cuts at Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Google, Stripe and Amazon. There was a snap cost-cutting cull at Twitter too, with 50 per cent of its Dublin office gone. Those are just the ones that made headlines. Derek Maguire, a financial planner with Financial Architects, gets about six to 10 enquiries a week from workers dealing with voluntary or compulsory redundancy. “The average person coming to us would be on about €100,000, maybe €120,000; they are typically aged 50-plus,” says Maguire. They are skilled and, with the country at near-full employment, they will get another job if they want it, he says. Nevertheless, the prospect of redundancy requires some financial reckoning. “The main questions people ask us are, ‘can I afford to take six months or a year off?’ I hear that all the time. They are flat out and they want a break,” Maguire says. Where there’s an offer of voluntary redundancy on the table, people are nervous of leaving a generous pension scheme. David Looney, a qualified financial planner with Alpha Wealth in Cork, has helped a lot of people dealing with redundancy this year. Most are skilled, well paid and will have the chance of moving to a similar role. “Sometimes it’s about giving them the reassurance that they are in a financial position that they can take a bit of time off,” says Looney. “Some are almost happy with redundancy. It can give them a financial cushion to take some time off work, to travel, pay off the mortgage, or spend time with the kids before taking up a similar role.” Both warn that it’s imperative that those dealing with redundancy don’t rely solely on canteen chats or a colleague’s WhatsApp group for financial advice. Your individual severance package, and your tax, pension and savings position will all shape what redundancy will mean for you. Everyone is different. “I remember a case where one person made the wrong decision about how to take redundancy, and eight colleagues followed them and did the same thing, so they all made the wrong decision,” Maguire says. A severance package might be broken down into three elements, says Looney. The first includes things like holidays you haven’t been paid for, or pay in lieu of a notice period. Maybe you have a bonus due, too. All of this goes through as a normal salary payment. If you are earning over €42,000, or €44,000 from next year, it’s going to be taxed at the top rate. “There’s not a whole lot you can do there, there are no tax-free exemptions,” says Looney. The second element is the statutory redundancy payment. This part is tax-free. Statutory redundancy is the minimum an employer must pay. It equates to two weeks’ gross pay for each year of your service, plus another one week gross pay. The weekly pay, however, is capped at €600. So whatever you earn, this will equate to €1,200 multiplied by your number of years of service, plus €600. The third element is an ex gratia redundancy payment. This is paid at your employer’s discretion. An ex gratia payment of six weeks’ pay per year of service as a lump sum would be typical, says Looney. Part of this ex gratia payment is tax-free and part can be taxable at your marginal tax rate. There are three ways to determine the tax-free part under Revenue rules. There is the basic exemption, the increased exemption and the Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit (SCSB) – this is a tax relief that normally benefits people with higher earnings and long service. Your employer will typically crunch the numbers for you and the highest answer will determine how much of the ex gratia payment is tax-free, says Looney. There is another option you have. If, when calculating the tax-free part of your ex gratia payment, the increased exemption calculation or the SCSB is giving the highest tax-free payment, this can mean waiving your right to a future tax-free lump sum from the part of your pension pot related to that employment. “So, sometimes the employee has to tick option A to waive their right and take more of their redundancy payment tax-free now, or else tick option B and retain the right to take a tax-free lump sum from their pension on retirement and, in turn, take less of their redundancy payment tax-free now,” says Looney. [ Pension tax relief rises to cover pots of up to €2.8m by 2029 under Cabinet plansOpens in new window ] It’s a case of deciding, do I want more tax-free now or later? “Sometimes people automatically think, it’s best to get as much as I can tax-free now, but they can end up shooting themselves in the foot down the line, particularly if they have a fairly decent pension,” Looney says. He gives the example of a young tech worker who has built up a pension pot of €100,000. If this grew over 30 years, it would be worth more than €400,000 by the time they reach 60. At that point, they can usually take out 25 per cent as a tax-free lump sum, which is over €100,000. “That can be quite handy down the line for clearing your mortgage or wiping out any debts and basically helping set you up for retirement,” says Looney. Where the pension amount with your employer is small, however, it might make sense to waive the right to the retirement lump sum for that part of your pension and to take more tax-free now as it won’t have a big bearing on your pension, he says. It comes down to cash flow, too. If you don’t have savings and are concerned about being out of work for a long time, you may need to prioritise paying your mortgage. Some workers want to know if they can afford to take a less well-paid, but a less stressful job next, Maguire says. “I spoke to someone on over €120,000 who was asking if she can afford to take an €85,000 job next. She said, I’m killing myself here at the moment. I don’t want to be killing myself.” If you are due a fairly decent severance package, it can come with a big tax bill. One thing you can do to help minimise it is to make a last-minute pension contribution. This has to be done before you leave the company, says Looney. Once you leave an employer, you can’t make a backdated contribution. You could take some of your holiday pay, payment in lieu of notice, any bonus or potentially your severance payment and put that into your pension, says Looney. Your scope for pension contribution is dependent on your age. Someone in their 30s can contribute 20 per cent tax-free. “The whole amount would arrive in to their pension and have the potential of growing tax-free in to their retirement rather than it being taxed through the severance payment,” Looney says. When your role is made redundant, it can be tempting to pull up anchor with that employer entirely – but yanking out your pension pot may not be the best choice. “It can be advantageous to keep your pension pots separate, if you can draw them down at different points in time,” says Looney. “If you move it all into your new employer’s scheme, you might be restricting your fund options and also you may not be able to access your pension pot until you leave or retire from the company,” he says. When you lose your job, register with your local Intreo office or social welfare branch, even if you don’t qualify for an unemployment payment. You may be able to get credited PRSI contributions to avoid a break in your social insurance record. You may be entitled to a tax refund. Those with enough PRSI contributions should qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit. That’s a payment of up to €232 a week, paid for a maximum of nine months, after which you can reapply. There is a sliding scale as to when you can get your first payment. If your redundancy payment is €50,000 to €55,000, for example, you are disqualified from claiming Jobseeker’s Benefit for one week of the nine-month entitlement. Those getting a redundancy payment of €90,000 and over are disqualified for nine weeks. Older workers used to be the ones in the redundancy crosshairs. Some companies operated formulas, notes a company remuneration insider. One veteran tech employer operated the “75″ rule – if your age and your number of years’ service exceeded 75, your number was up. A financial institution operated a policy that if you were over 50 and on more than €50,000, it was time to go. Not all, but some staff looked forward to eventually meeting the criteria to get paid to go. Rolling redundancies are the operating model in many sectors now. “This year, we are seeing redundancy packages to a much younger cohort – within tech companies, for example,” Looney says. “We are dealing with people in their 20s and 30s getting redundancy packages.” As well as company metrics for employee wellness, there are metrics around salary and pension costs, too. When an employee becomes too expensive, says the insider, then comes redundancy. When a shareholder flaps its wings in Silicon Valley or China, it can mean a tornado for workers here. “Some are handpicked, they will get rid of the deadwood, and then they will look at costs. Are there people we can replace, perhaps for a lower salary and pension?” If you wonder why the average age in some companies never edges past 30, it’s not because the employees don’t age. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC
