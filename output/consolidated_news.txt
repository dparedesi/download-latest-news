MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump picks a tariff fight with America's top trade partners, federal workers brace for another tumultuous week, and the fallout continues from Mr. Trump blaming diversity policies for the midair collision of an Army Black Hawk and a passenger jet. Washington and the rest of the world are waking up to what feels like a new reality show, as President Trump continues to make good on his campaign promises, despite the confusion and controversy surrounding some of them. We will talk with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Brian Mast. On the good news front, American Keith Siegel has a happy family reunion following his release from Hamas captivity. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. One of the president's biggest campaign promises was to enact steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Saturday night, he did just that. And the move has already sparked international backlash and sent chills through the financial world. We begin with senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, who is traveling with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Panama – Ed. ED O'KEEFE: Margaret, good morning. These are sweeping tariffs, the present using a 1977 law to suggest there is now an extraordinary threat from fentanyl and illegal immigration and that all three countries are failing to address those challenges. So, starting Tuesday, there will be 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican exports, 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian exports, 10 percent tariffs on Canadian energy exports and 10 percent tariffs on all goods from China. This morning, the president acknowledged this could lead to higher prices, writing: "Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe and maybe not," he wrote on his social media platform, "but we will make America great again and it will all be worth the price that must be paid." MARGARET BRENNAN: This has triggered a trade war. Canada's prime minister announced tariffs on American beer, bourbon, wine, lumber, fruits, clothing, appliances. So, Ed, what else should we expect is coming that could hurt American consumers? ED O'KEEFE: Well, we should anticipate there could be a tit for tat here, because the orders that the president signed Saturday night give him the authority to keep raising tariffs on the three countries if they respond in kind. And that could contribute to an uptick in inflation, which we have seen in recent weeks. Now, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke directly to Americans last night, warning the tariffs – quote – "will put your jobs at risk," potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities. And he said Canada's planned dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs will raise American grocery and gas prices. And while President Trump accused Mexico of having an alliance with drug cartels, President Claudia Sheinbaum said: "If such alliances exist anywhere, they exist in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to criminal groups." And China says it firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests. It is planning to protest these tariffs to the World Trade Organization. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, what's on Secretary Rubio's agenda in Panama? ED O'KEEFE: Yes, well, you know, Rubio, of course, the first Latino secretary of state, so he is taking his first overseas mission here to Central America and the Caribbean to reiterate President Trump's concern that China now has too much influence over the Panama Canal. The Panamanians insist they have full control – Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks, Ed. We go now to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner. He is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and joins us from Palm Beach, Florida. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any sense yet what the cost of these tariffs could be for Virginia, which does have a wine industry, for example? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes. Well, first of all, Margaret, I think we might want to call this the Donald Trump Super Bowl tax with the big game coming next week, if – avocados, tomatoes, beer from Mexico, prices going to go up. The question around cars, I have read already about $3,000 of additional price on cars, up to $10,000 on trucks, because we have actually integrated very well our auto production with Canada and Mexico. I think as well about the fact that for years we have been encouraging businesses to leave China and nearshore to a place like Mexico. Now that is going to end up costing consumers more. And for industries like ours, like the wine industry, where we are growing rapidly in Virginia, those folks are going to get socked as well. So this is a – remember, Donald Trump got hired trying to lower – saying he was going to lower grocery prices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Two weeks in, he's doing something that's going to do the absolute opposite. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will track the impact of this trade war. Senator, I want to switch topics. You are, as we said, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. We watched that hearing this week for Tulsi Gabbard. She had two particular exchanges with Republican senators, Todd Young and James Lankford, who pressed her to say that Edward Snowden was a traitor. Lankford said it was a softball, but listen to what happened. (Begin VT) SENATOR TED BUDD (R-North Carolina): Did he betray a duty, did he betray the trust of the American people? Which is – according to Merriam-Webster, that's the definition of a traitor. FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD (D-Hawaii): Edward Snowden broke the law and he released this information in a way that he should not have. He also acknowledged and exposed information that was unconstitutional. SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD (R-Oklahoma): Was he a traitor at the time when he took America's secrets, released them in public, and then ran to China and became a Russian citizen? FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD: Senator, I'm focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You have worked closely with these senators. I know they're Republicans and you're from a different party, but when you speak to them privately, do you think they can get over that, her refusal to call him a traitor, and actually vote to confirm her or even move her out of committee? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, Margaret, Edward Snowden released more information, probably did as much damage to our intelligence community as anyone in history. And the fact that Ms. Gabbard, who actually had legislation to pardon Edward Snowden – she called him a brave whistle-blower – couldn't bring herself to call him a traitor, I think, is disqualifying just on plain judgment. What would that – what signal, if she got in, would that send to the I.C. workers or contractors? Is she going to suddenly enforce the law, if she called Snowden a brave whistle-blower? And MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: what I'm particularly concerned about, Margaret, is, our sharing of information with our allies, that's not written into law. That's based on trust. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Will they really trust to share their intelligence with us if she can't call out one of the worst traitors in recent American history as such, as a traitor? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think she can even make it out of committee and make it to a full vote on the floor of the Senate? SENATOR MARK WARNER: I know there are a number – our committee is historically the most bipartisan. We check our partisan hats at the door. There is enormous MAGA pressure that – as we have seen, put on senators who are willing to stand up. We will know this coming week. But – and it's not just Snowden. It was America's most powerful intelligence tool is a law called – or something we call Section 702. She left us totally confused on her views on that. And as well her lack of judgment, whether it's going to visit Assad when he was head of Syria, whether it was taking trips paid for by sketchy groups, or echoing Putin's comments that somehow NATO started the war in Ukraine… MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: … that is not the judgment of somebody that would run 18 intelligence communities – agencies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch to see those Republican senators. I want to ask you as well about what's happening at the FBI and the Justice Department. President Trump, he campaigned on this promise to restructure the government. Seems like he's implementing that this week. So far, between the FBI and Justice Department, we have seen at least 20 terminations. Some are calling this a purge, but is it overstating it if we're seeing 20 people lose their jobs? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, if you are suddenly taking out the most experienced folks at Justice or at the FBI, how does that make us stronger? And what he's saying is, every FBI agent that somehow touched the January 6 investigation – that was a comprehensive investigation. I have been told there were – almost half of all the FBI agents at least had some involvement. Remember, this was a case that was taken up against these rioters all across the country. If you're suddenly going to get rid of all of those, that could be thousands. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: What does that mean for our cybersecurity? What does it mean for our trafficking and stop against fentanyl and other drugs? What does it mean in terms of serious crime investigations? This would be devastating. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's – well, our reporting is that the order was for a list to be drawn up of those 1,500 or so people who worked on those cases. We're going to try to get to the bottom of whether they're actually going to be fired or not. That's not clear. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But, Margaret – Margaret, it – we have seen – but we have seen, you get your name on these lists. It's like – it's like Trump's potentially illegal offer to buy out all the federal employees, where we have no money in the budget for. But we had a great tragedy this week in D.C. with the air – the crash. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: We are already short air traffic controllers. If suddenly 2,000 or 3,000 air traffic controllers were to say, hey, I'm going to take this buyout, our airspace couldn't operate. And yet he's doing this so recklessly and, frankly, again… MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it being offered to them? SENATOR MARK WARNER: … without legal authority. Pardon me. Say again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that open to – is it being offered to air traffic controllers? SENATOR MARK WARNER: All federal employees. My understanding, went out to two million federal employees this offer, which, again, OPM does not have that authority to start with. That was who it came from. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But it is – I can tell you, with lots of federal employees, we got chaos on steroids going on. And we had heard from Trump's supporters, the OMB director, for example, that he wanted to traumatize federal workers. Well, that is happening. And these workers are the folks that inspect our fruit, our milk, our eggs. What happens if they all quit? MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you – and I know many of those people live in the state of Virginia. They are your constituents. I want to ask you about your former partner on the Intelligence Committee Marco Rubio, now secretary of state. He told a podcaster this week the president made the decision to cancel security protection for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served during the first term, because he looked through a threat versus cost risk assessment. I know you're briefed on intelligence. Did the threat from Iran to assassinate former U.S. officials go away? SENATOR MARK WARNER: No. I have seen no intelligence that would indicate that that threat has been diminished. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Secretary Rubio endorsed this. SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think this is payback. And it's not just Pompeo. Listen, I have not seen any intelligence. And, here, I agree with my partner Tom Cotton, the now-chair of the Intel Committee. We have seen nothing to indicate less threat, and also taking out, for example – down the security detail for former General Chief of Staff Mark Milley, this is all about retribution. And he's putting people's lives in danger, which is just unbelievable. And I wish more people would stand up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Florida Republican Congressman Brian Mast, who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the State Department and its programs. He joins us from Fort Pierce, Florida. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST (R-Florida): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start first on the tariffs that were announced overnight by President Trump. You know there's a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. President Trump negotiated it during his first term. The tariffs may violate that deal. If he's invoking tariffs on a national security basis, can you explain the threat posed by Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes, and he was – President Trump, that is to say, was very specific in his executive order, outlined that it's specifically related to fentanyl. It's specifically related to human trafficking. And there's a trust, but verify situation that has to go on here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Through Canada? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Through Canada as well, absolutely, fentanyl through Canada, human trafficking through Canada, also with China in that mix for fentanyl as well. That was specifically outlined in it. And until that comes to an end, this is what's going to be on the table. And bear in mind as well that USMCA reauthorization is coming up in the coming-up months and years. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't believe that this violates the trade agreement, the treaty? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: The violation has been to the United States of America. It's been to our sovereignty. It's been to our people. We've been taken for granted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but Congress votes on these things. So… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: And I will make sure certainly, as the Foreign Affairs chairman, that we give every single authority as we go through State Department reauthorization, to make sure that this moves forward, as well as purging of people throughout the State Department, other agencies, where we're freezing aid. These are all very important and necessary steps to make sure that we secure America. And we're going to support that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry. Can I follow up on what you just said there? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Please do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to authorize purging of State Department personnel? What does that mean exactly? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, if you want to take a look at the State Department, where DEI has been a priority over, let's say, diplomacy on many accounts, I can give you hundreds of examples of where they were authorizing… MARGARET BRENNAN: What proof do you have of that? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Sure, let's list them off, half-a-million dollars to expand atheism in Nepal, $50,000 to do, let's see, a transgender opera in Colombia, $47,000 to do an LGBTQ trans comic book in Peru, $20,000 a pop to do drag shows in Ecuador. Shall I continue with more examples of where DEI was a priority? MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, it certainly seems like there could be a review of things. Foreign aid, as you know, is less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget. So we're talking small amounts of money by comparison. But when… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: We're still talking about tens and tens of billions of dollars. And if you want to go to somebody else, on the other side of the aisle, Samantha Power, she had a worthy goal, although it was a stupid goal. She said she was hoping to get the amount of foreign aid, U.S. aid dollars that go to actual aid up to 30 cents on the dollar from 10 cents on the dollar. That's a major problem that we have this agency that that's all that goes abroad… MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … when it should be the American worker's dollar. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think now you're talking about the USAID, the aid agency… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: … which is a – separate from the State Department currently and has about $40 billion worth… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Which is likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell – yes, tell me about that, because that's where I was going. Has the Trump administration informed you of plans to dismantle or significantly shrink this agency? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: This is something that I'm working on very specifically, in conjunction with Secretary Rubio, to make sure that there's the appropriate command-and-control of these agencies, where, again, to make that same point, right now, maybe 10 to 30 cents… MARGARET BRENNAN: They already report to the secretary of state. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But 10 to 30 cents on the dollar is what actually goes to aid. So there's not the right amount of command-and- control that's going on with the way that it's set up currently. And let's make another point on this as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress – Congress authorizes and earmarks funding. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Most of these dollars – most of these dollars that go out of USAID, 70-plus percent don't come from U.S. growers, U.S. farmers, U.S. ranchers, or go through us ports. And that's another big problem for America. MARGARET BRENNAN: So – I'm sorry. If Congress already authorizes and earmarks the funding, just to be very clear, you're not endorsing getting rid of USAID as a separate department, which already reports to the secretary of state, are you? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department and having it fall under one of the other parts of United States Department of State, because of its failure. I just went over the numbers twice with you in the amount of aid that actually makes it into the hands. I mean, you could you could almost say – this is a little bit hyperbole – but there's probably more dollars that go towards state dinners around the D.C. Beltway than what actually goes into rice and beans abroad. That's the state of what's going on with USAID. And Samantha Power said no less herself. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think every single administration authorizes reviews, could increase efficiencies. There are plenty of people who propose bringing it more under the authority of the State Department. Madeleine Albright tried to do that. That's not a new MAGA idea. I think the question here, though, is about how you do it. Do you still believe that in the law signed in the 1960s that Congress has to sign off on any changes to USAID? Or do you think President Trump can just make all of this happen through executive order? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: So, all of those examples that you just gave of those historical figures, the difference is now the job is going to get done. It's going to be 99.99 percent of cents on the dollar actually go towards what it's intended, instead of people around the Beltway. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so you're talking about – you're talking about… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: That's what's going to happen. That's the change. MARGARET BRENNAN: … efficiencies in aids versus restructuring. So let me ask you about that. Well, like I said… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Well, that requires restructuring, 100 percent. You can't create that efficiency just by wishing it into existence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: You have to restructure where the failures are and put the right things in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course. But what we're hearing from many of these aid organizations and officials is that, can you restructure after you finish the review and not freeze funding now, immediately? I spoke to former USAID global health head Atul Gawande yesterday. He told me this isn't a pause in foreign aid. It is a demolition of USAID. As he put it, you can't pause a flight in midair. That's what's happening. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's… MARGARET BRENNAN: This immediate freeze in funding is stopping agencies in the field from being able to do the work they do. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Let's say why that is so important. And let's talk about the real facts on the ground. The Trump administration comes in or representatives like myself that do oversight. The agencies will literally not tell us what they are writing grants for, literally, or they will lie about it, or they will tell the new political appointees under the Trump administration, I'm just not going to tell you that. Those are real things that have happened. So the way that you make them come and answer for where they are actually sending dollars is to say, we're freezing that. We're putting it on hold. You need to come to us and explain what it is you're doing, why you're doing it and where it's actually saving life. And guess what? MARGARET BRENNAN: But… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: When they don't come explain something, that also begs the question, why were they doing it in the first place? MARGARET BRENNAN: But the way these things work is, the contractors have to front the cash, then go to the U.S. government for reimbursement. So when you put in an immediate freeze, that means drugs don't get delivered. That means they don't get distributed. That means bomb disposal units don't get to go out there in places like Cambodia and remove ordnance or provide help to people who receive it. That's the pushback from aid organizations, who are saying they're going to have to carry out layoffs in the thousands in the coming week. Does that concern you at all? REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: They will have an opportunity. It doesn't concern me because of the grift that has been going on to the American taxpayer, the American worker. That's what needs to be answered for. And so you look at this. Let's use PEPFAR as an example. You were talking about drugs going to individuals. There was a release of that hold that was put – that was authorized. But it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries like China. That is an example of them taking us for granted. We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this? Should we be paying it for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Should the American worker be footing the bill for that? Those are real questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, real questions, but, in the meantime, people need their drugs while you ask those questions. So that's where the disagreement is with the aid organizations. But let me ask you about air traffic controllers and what's happening here at home. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: Not with all the leaders of other countries, though. I believe I saw the leader of Kenya as one step up and say, hey, this is an example where we need to step up for ourselves and show how we can take care of ourselves. And I believe that was the president there. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, as I was saying, about another committee you sit on, Transportation Committee. The FAA hiring policy for air traffic controllers, including under the first Trump administration, offered equal opportunity to those with targeted disabilities, including, as the president read, hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, severe intellectual debility – disability. Excuse me. The president singled this out, this policy, as a contributor possibly to the crash. Do you agree with the diversity policy, or do you agree with the president? I know you lost two limbs serving this country in Afghanistan. Do you hear those words and take offense to them or… REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: No, no offense. Let's unpack it. Number one, I will use myself as an example, right? There are things that I am suited to do, no doubt. But flying an aircraft, to stick with the subject at hand, would not be one of them. I could fly a personal – a personal aircraft. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is air traffic controllers. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: But to put me in charge of traffic or 150 lives, that would not be the right case for me personally, given my physical disabilities and foot pedals on an aircraft. To go to the diversity side of it and the actual crash, yes, there were very real errors that took place both in the air traffic control tower and with the helicopter pilots, it seems. But, more systemically, is there a big hiring problem across all federal agencies, to include the FAA, where they made the priority diversity and inclusion… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN MAST: … instead of excellence and performance? Yes, that's the case. They made the priority appearance and lifestyle and not the big deal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to independent Senator Bernie Sanders from Burlington, Vermont. Good morning to you, Senator. Very quickly, do you have a sense of the impact of these tariffs on your state? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, it's going to be very severe. But this is not the only thing that worries me. Margaret, we are living in an unprecedented moment in American history. We're looking at a rapid growth of oligarchy. We're looking at a rapid growth of authoritarianism. And I fear that we're looking at a rapid growth of kleptocracy as well. And I'm going to do everything I can to work with my supporters all over this country to stand up and fight back to make sure we have an economy that works for everybody… MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: … not just Elon Musk, and that we maintain American democracy. Difficult times. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator – Senator, I'm going to have to ask you more about what you mean by that on the other side of this commercial break, because I have to take it. Stay with us. We hope all of you will as well. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders. Senator, thank you for sticking with us through the break. I want to ask you about some of the rather fiery hearings you were a part of this past week, in particular with the potential Health and Human Services secretary to be, RFK Jr. You told CBS in December you think he's right about the food industry and obesity and what he says about high prices for prescription drugs. But during the hearing, you had some sharp exchanges. Are you, at this point, decided on your vote? Will you cross over and help Republicans confirm him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Well, I have - Margaret, I have up to now voted for some Trump appointee. A few. I voted against most. And I'll make my decisions next week. Where Kennedy is right is, we are an unhealthy society. A point I've been making, many others have been making for a long time. One of the things that concerns me very much, and Kennedy mentioned it, is our life expectancy. How long our people live is five years less than other wealthy countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And if you're working class in this countries, you live six or seven years lower than if you are rich. It is an issue we have to deal with. And I think the kind of addictive and poisonous food that the food industry is providing our kids is one of the factors, not many. But when you have Kennedy come forward and saying he cannot, he believes, continues to believe, that autism is caused by vaccines, despite the fact that there have been a dozen studies over the years which disprove that, when he has other conspiracy theories, when he cannot acknowledge that if you're going to make America healthy, we've got to guarantee health care to all people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He was not clear about the need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug costs. So, I was not particularly happy with his presentation. MARGARET BRENNAN: On the autism point, there is no established cause of autism spectrum disorder, but one in 36 children have been identified with it, according to the CDC. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern in this space, including from your Republican colleague, Cassidy. He is a medical doctor. He said he's struggling with the nomination because he fears Kennedy may undermine faith in vaccines. Take a listen. (BEGIN VC) SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): I recognize, man, if you come out unequivocally, vaccines are safe, it does not cause autism, that would have an incredible impact. That's your power. So, what's it going to be? Will it be using the credibility to support lots of articles, or will it be using credibility to undermine? (END VC) MARGARET BRENNAN: The senator seemed to be saying, if you want my vote, answer the question. You said you haven't decided on RFK and how you're going to vote. Is this a red line for you? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, I - I don't want - I - I - I - Margaret, what I'm saying is, I just don't go around making these announcements. I will vote when I'll vote. But anybody who watched that hearing understands my deep concerns about Kennedy. But I've got to tell you, the conspiracy theories that he is throwing out is not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration. And, to me, what is most important in terms of what's been happening since Trump has been president is not just him having the three wealthiest people in the country stand behind him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And, by the way, anybody, any working person in this country should understand what that means. It means that you're going to have a government working for the very rich, not for the working class of this country. But the movement toward authoritarianism - MARGARET BRENNAN: But - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, go ahead. I'm sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, no, I want to ask you about that, but just to push you on this point, because it's not just a matter of a vote, like, what you are saying is that someone at the top of the - the health department who is rejecting science or rejecting data that says there's no linkage here, no proven linkage here, by not being clear and saying that's a red line, doesn't that lend itself to misinterpretation? Why wouldn't you say that's disqualifying for him? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Because I have not said - I have not said to anybody how I will vote. It doesn't matter. I will vote when I'll vote. But let me just tell you - MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because Republicans were hoping you would help them. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The idea that - MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I'm asking you. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I know, they hope for a lot of things. It just may not happen. But I think - MARGARET BRENNAN: Ah - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: All right, go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. I'm sorry. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look, the bottom line is, we have a health care crisis in America. We're the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people. We pay by far the highest prices in the world, for prescription drugs. Our life expectancy is shorter than other countries. Yes, we've got to deal with it in a very direct and forceful manner. You've got to take on the insurance companies. You've got to move to Medicare for all. You've got to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We have to understand why our life expectancy is lower. And, by the way, it's not just health care. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's the fact that so many of our working people are stressed out by inadequate incomes that that's having an impact on not only their life spans but their well-being. Those are issues we've got to address. MARGARET BRENNAN: During the campaign, then candidate Trump and Vance, they - they were very much championing working class people, as you have through the years. They said they support unions, they don't want to tax tips, they want child care tax credits, they're pro worker. Do you see any opportunities to work with them on specific policies and, if so, where? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if they were telling the truth and they will go forward in trying to stand up for the working class, of course I will work with them. But I've got to tell you, just last week what Trump did is essentially neuter the National Labor Relations Board. This is something that Bezos wanted. It's something that Elon Musk wanted. What that means, if you are a worker right now, and there are millions of workers who want to join a union because they know unions will give you better wages and better working conditions, better benefits. What they have done is neutered that so right now union busting corporations, like Amazon and others, can do what they do against workers with impunity. That is not standing with workers. We need to raise the starvation minimum wage, which is now $7.25 an hour, to a living wage. I've not heard one word from the Trump administration about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they want to leave that up to states and corporations as well to - to make a decision, not - SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, but that's - that ain't going to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance told us last Sunday, despite those big tech CEOs giving money to the inauguration for Donald Trump, he still believing they have too much power in big tech and that he says, you know, they're still very much on notice in regard to his past warnings they could be broken up. Is that a place you are also concerned and could work with him on? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think Lina Khan, the former head of the FTC, did a great job. And if Vance wants to work with us on that, he's right. You have right now not only more income and wealth inequality in this country than ever before, more concentration of ownership in the tech industry and in other industries. Do I think we should start breaking up some of these large corporations? Absolutely I do. And we'll be happy to work with them if they're serious about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The FBI is without a permanent director at this point, although Mr. Trump's nominee, Kash Patel, could get a vote as early as this week. We turn now to Frank Figliuzzi, he is a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, who joins us from Houston. And here, CBS News justice correspondent Scott Macfarlane. And you cover justice and FBI. A lot happening in both of the departments. And I want to bottom line first with Frank, if I could, digging into your experience here. If you can help us understand the reporting from Andres Triay and Pat Milton that the executive assistant directors, those in national security, cyber, criminal division, are being forced to resign, retire or face termination. What does it mean to have those positions forced out? FRANK FIGLIUZZI (Retired FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence and Author of "The FBI War: Inside the Bureau's Code of Excellence"): Yes, when you combine that essential layer of leadership, executive assistant directors control multiple operational divisions. So, at least a half a dozen of those reportedly are gone. And then you get down to the level of at least two or three special agents in charge in the field, including Miami, Washington field office. You are starting to lose too much experience. And if this plays out next week as reportedly it might, with regard to dismissing hundreds or thousands of special agents in the field who have touched January 6th cases or Trump related cases, this makes America less safe. This is not reduction, this is not efficiency, it makes America less safe when you lose that much expertise this quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Just to follow up there, Scott Macfarlane, what Frank was referring to is a list that was requested. CBS' Rob Legare actually obtained the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who was previously the personal attorney for Donald Trump. SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: He ordered the acting director of the FBI to compile everyone who was an employee who was assigned to the 1,500 January 6th cases. There were also eight executives pushed out. Is this a legal and lawful order? Are FBI officials going to actually fire the people on these lists? SCOTT MACFARLANE: The list is required, and must be produced by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday according to our latest reporting. Whether it is produced is a different question. But the bottom line here is that such a list, Margaret, would include FBI employees from every FBI field office across the country. This is not just a Washington investigation. The January 6th cases went nationwide. What's more, a lot of the names that are going to be on this list, according to my reporting, are already public domain. They're in the court filings, they're in the court docket, they're already out there. So, it's going to be difficult to mask anybody's name or anybody's identity. Whether this is legally permissible is a different question. Whether these firings are legally permissible is a different question. We know the acting FBI director, in a memo sent to his employees, he emphasized that there are robust protections. His word is robust protections for FBI agents against employment actions. Feels to me like there's an galvanization of FBI employees, if they want to fight this, to try to make some effort to push back. Whether they do so is a different question. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why was asking, is it actually going to be firings or is this actually just going to be, you can't do what - what the president's team is pressing to do. Brian Fitzpatrick, you know him from covering The Hill, he's a Republican from Pennsylvania, used to be an FBI agent, gave CBS a statement I want to read here. He says he wants to emphasize to the administration, "line level street agents have little to no control over the office to which they're sent, the cases to which they're assigned, and leads which they are asked to cover. Much like the military, they go where they are told and perform the investigative duties that their chain of command orders them to do." Frank, I know you know this, but that is a Republican explaining the basic function of how law enforcement works. It sounds like there's going to be pushback on the potential of these firings. FRANK FIGLIUZZI: Yes, indeed. It's been reported by multiple media outlets that the acting director pushed back very hard and very loudly against the DOJ request. And reportedly he may have been threatened with termination himself. Interest only enough, both the acting director and acting assistant director would be on that list. They both worked January 6 related cases or Trump related cases. So, we've got a potential standoff that's here. But yes, line agents did nothing outside of the law or attorney general guidelines. They simply worked criminal cases, in many cases gained convictions and guilty pleas. And if they were literally all to be pushed out the door, we would be talking about thousands of FBI agents. There's only 14,000 agents in the field and we'd be talking close to 6,000 of them who worked such cases. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Scott, we were just talking about Kash Patel, the boss isn't in place yet. He was asked under oath before Congress if he knew of some of these actions that were underway literally as he was testifying. He said he didn't know anything about the firings. Is this going to - is it credible and is it going to be a problem for his confirmation? SCOTT MACFARLANE: This might have been simultaneous, Margaret. These questions, including from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were happening as a lot of this communication was going back and forth over terminations, resignations, retirements. Kash Patel has been on a trajectory towards confirmation as the next FBI director almost from the jump. The one vote I've been watching closely, Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican, up for re-election in 2026, he introduced Kash Patel and validated him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SCOTT MACFARLANE: It seems nobody has jumped up this weekend to say, I'm now opposed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Macfarlane, it's going to be another interesting week in Washington. Thank you for bottom lining it. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still holding and three more hostages were released yesterday, including American Israeli dual national Keith Siegel. His niece, Hanna Siegel, is here with us this morning. Good morning. You've been waiting for this for over 400 days. How is your uncle doing? HANNA SIEGEL (Niece of Freed U.S. Israeli Hostage Keith Siegel): I'm - first, thank you for having me. I've been dreaming about being here today. He's - he's doing OK. He's - he's lost some weight. He's pale. But he's strong. And he's doing OK. Somehow. We're incredibly grateful. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean we've seen the video and the images of him being reunited with family members. Will your father, his brother, see him soon? HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. He's on his way. We've been staggering the family visits so as not to overwhelm him. But, yes, we are all - we are all going to see him. And actually his youngest daughter, Shir, got engaged a month before October 7th. And so the wedding planning began and then abruptly came to a stop as both of her parents, Keith and my aunt Aviva (Ph), who was released in the November 2023 deal, were taken hostage. So, what we've talked about is that, you know, someday we're all going to get together and throw an absolutely epic wedding. And that's what we're looking forward to now. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you've been an advocate for the family here in Washington, both with the Biden and the Trump administrations. In your view, do you think this deal, this hostage release, would have happened without American pressure? HANNA SIEGEL: No, definitely not. And I do want to say, so the Biden team, Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk, President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Bill Burns, they were so tireless in their commit to get this deal done. But the really amazing thing is that the minute that President Trump was elected, his team started working hand in glove with the Biden administration. We felt no break in the commitment to get Keith home. Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler, along with President Trump, started working hand in hand with the Biden team. And I don't know what other issue you can say that about with these administrations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: The Trump team really did push it over the finish line. And we're incredibly grateful, incredibly grateful to - to all of them for the work that they did. I also just want to say the Qatari negotiators, mediators, who were part of the November 2023 deal were also instrumental. And then what I've learned in this completely bizarre experience is that there is a whole industry of people, NGOs, who work on hostage negotiations on behalf of families. We worked with Global Reach, Mickey Bergman, Stacia George and Eric Lebson, they're a non-profit. We would not have gotten Keith home without them. So, it was just a tremendous group effort across the board, across political lines, and that's heartening. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us back in April on this program that you were worried, quote, "it's not arguably in Prime Minister Netanyahu's political interest to close a deal" And you were worried he was going to sink it. He has announced phase two of the hostage framework begins getting negotiated tomorrow, Monday. Do you think he's incentivized now to actually see this deal through? HANNA SIEGEL: I think that the Trump team has done a really tremendous job of putting serious pressure on him and that that is making a difference. I think that he - you know, we're ecstatic that Keith is home, but it took almost 500 days. And that is in part because of Netanyahu. This deal was available for months. The Biden team was working on it. And - and he wouldn't come to the table often. I mean there are - this is such a complicated issue, but I am worried - I think this is a really fragile deal, as we all understand. And so, you know, I have a lot of faith in the Trump team and in all of the people working on this to put serious pressure on him to see it through. I think what we've seen is that diplomacy and political agreement is the only way to get all of the hostages home. And, you know, we're - we're one of the lucky ones, but there remain five American citizens and dozens of other hostages who still need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the remains of some of those Americans wouldn't come through until phase three. HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And phase two, we know, Edan Alexander, a uniformed IDF soldier, who is a U.S. citizen - HANNA SIEGEL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The deal would have to continue to work to actually bring him home. Sagui Chen, we're waiting on him to be released as well. HANNA SIEGEL: Exactly. Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I - I emphasize that because when we talk about deals and diplomacy, these are lives at risk. And if the deal doesn't continue to stay in place, they may be at risk. HANNA SIEGEL: And - and these - and these are Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HANNA SIEGEL: These are Americans who need to come home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hanna, thank you. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you so much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And congratulations. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's great news. HANNA SIEGEL: Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Before we go, "CBS Evening News" co-anchor and presidential historian John Dickerson has some thoughts on the tone of those Oval Office moments following tragedy. (BEGIN VT) JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): After the deadliest air crash in 20 years in America, President Trump responded, as presidents have before. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation. In moments like this, the differences between Americans fade to nothing compared to the bonds of affection and loyalty that unite us all. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Differences fade because we are all reminded of the basic truth, that we are all human and life is fragile. In such rare moments, a president can transform private grief into public meaning. These presidential moments live in our collective memory. Ronald Reagan addressing the nation after the Challenger disaster. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): George W. Bush at Ground Zero. GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The nation sends its love and compassion. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): Barack Obama singing at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (singing): Amazing grace. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): In speech, by bull horn, in song, and now, by executive memorandum. That's how Donald Trump used the Oval Office where Reagan had eulogized the Challenger astronauts. Though the president had earlier declared an hour of anguish for our nation, for him, the hour only lasted a few minutes. He spent much of the remainder of this unique moment distributing blame. TRUMP: I put safety first. Obama, Biden, and the Democrats put policy first. And they put politics at a level that nobody's ever seen. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The starkest claim, the one behind the Oval Office signing ceremony, that diversity programs had caused the crash that killed 67. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a presidential memorandum titled Immediate Assessment of Aviation Safety. In light of the damage done to aviation safety by the Biden administration's DEI and woke policies. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): When asked what proof he had that diversity was the culprit, and the president said he had no proof but didn't need any. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm trying to figure out how you can come to the conclusion right now that diversity had something to do with this crash. TRUMP: Because I have common sense, OK. And, unfortunately, a lot of people don't. JOHN DICKERSON (voice over): The president's certainty about the crash, despite the lack of proof, suggested for many Americans that the common sense he was referring to was that diversity means things automatically go wrong when people of color are in charge. In one press conference he traveled the entire length of the emotional register, from asserting that the differences between Americans fade to returning the focus to those differences. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Dub: the copy trading app that has teens talking

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Social media changed everything from news consumption to shopping. Now, Dub thinks it can do the same for investing through an influencer-driven marketplace where users can follow the trades of top investors with a few taps. Think of it as TikTok meets Wall Street. Founded by 23-year-old Steven Wang — a Harvard drop-out who began investing in second grade with his parents’ blessing – Dub is betting the future of investing isn’t about picking stocks but picking people. The app allows users to follow the strategies of traders, hedge funds, and even those mimicking high-profile politicians. Instead of making individual trade decisions, Dub users can copy entire portfolios. The concept has struck a chord. Dub has already surpassed 800,000 downloads and raised $17 million in seed funding – with a new round seemingly in the works. Less clear is whether Dub can avoid the pitfalls of previous fintech startups. Inspired by GameStop Retail investing has evolved dramatically over the past two decades. The days of $7 trading commissions and clunky brokerage interfaces were blown apart roughly a decade ago by mobile-first platforms like Robinhood that invited people to trade for free. At the same time, social media is reshaping how people, and particularly members of Gen Z, make financial decisions. As a Harvard student during the pandemic — one who was trading from his dorm room “because you couldn’t really do anything at school” — Wang came to believe these two trends, retail investing and influencer-driven decision-making, were on a collision course. Between the GameStop saga, Elon Musk’s ability to “move the Dogecoin and Bitcoin markets with every tweet,” and people’s willingness to “really follow ideas and individuals to a whole new level,” Wang decided to drop out in 2021 and start building Dub. Right now, the platform’s average user is between 30 and 35, says Wang, though New York-based Dub is clearly finding its way in front of an even younger audience. In recent weeks, this editor’s 15-year-old has asked more than once about “investing like Nancy Pelosi” after marinating in Dub ads on Instagram. Pelosi isn’t personally trading on Dub; it’s just a trader on the platform mirroring her disclosed moves. Still, the idea has caught fire. “Nancy Pelosi is up 123% on Dub with real capital,” says Wang, “and we’ve made our customers millions of dollars since that portfolio was launched on the platform.” Dub isn’t free. Wang was determined to generate revenue from the outset, and Dub does that today through a $10-per-month subscription model. Wang says further that some “top” portfolios on the platform charge management fees and Dub takes a 25% cut of those fees. In the meantime, Dub has scaled in part through organic growth. “Creators who are good traders on the app are incentivized to bring their audience,” says Wang, whose parents immigrated from China and who grew up in Detroit. Dub is also investing aggressively in advertising, leaning heavily into Meta ads in particular to acquire users, including on Instagram. “We’ve been really lucky where I think the broader American population really believes there are other people out there that have an edge over them when it comes to the investing world,” says Wang. Fighting words The question now is whether Dub will follow a similar path as other fast-growing fintech startups, many of which have found themselves in the crosshairs of regulators. Robinhood disrupted finance by making trading free, but it also faced regulatory scrutiny ahead of its 2021 IPO, ultimately ditching a feature that showered users with digital confetti every time they made a trade. Dub says it’s keen to avoid the same mistakes. The company spent more than two years working with FINRA and the SEC before launching, ensuring its model complied with financial regulations. “We didn’t just navigate regulation at Dub — we embraced it,” Wang says. (Like Robinhood, Dub is a fully licensed broker-dealer.) A big distinction, argues Wang, is that Dub is designed to educate users, not just encourage blind speculation. The platform displays risk scores, risk-adjusted returns, and portfolio stability metrics to help investors make informed decisions, he says. He suggests it’s safer for investors than Robinhood. Says Wang: “I have a lot of respect for what [CEO] Vlad [Tenev] has done in making trading free. But at the end of the day, making it super easy to trade without expert guidance, without education, is really just gambling for the broader population.” To underscore his point, Wang points to the decision of Robinhood — along with Coinbase and other exchanges — to make the meme coin TRUMP available for customers ahead of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. While it initially surged in price, its price has plummeted since. Says Wang, “I think fundamentally the incentives are just misaligned between these big platforms that are public companies now that need to make money” and that “generally” their customers have “probably lost money.” (Worth noting: in a separate, recent conversation with Robinhood’s Tenev about Dub, Tenev proposed to TechCrunch that copy trading could become of greater interest to regulators, and that Dub may not yet be under the “magnifying glass” because of its comparatively smaller size.) Either way, not everyone is sold on Dub’s vision. The biggest knock against such platforms, says critics, is that stock picking underperforms passive investing over the long run, with studies showing that most actively managed funds fail to beat the S&P 500. It’s a criticism with which Wang is familiar — and on which he’s quick to push back. For one thing, he argues that many such studies are “cherry-picked.” (“I bet a lot of those are sponsored by the passive investing index companies,” he says.) Further, says Wang, there’s a reason that actively managed hedge funds like Citadel are thriving. “If you look at what the ultra wealthy can do, they’re giving their money to Ken Griffin of Citadel, [because] they’re consistently putting up non-correlated returns year after year after year,” he says. If one more broadly “looks at the growth of the hedge fund space and the asset management space,” continues Wang, “there’s a reason why it’s growing. It’s because they are making money for their customers.” Topics Editor in Chief & General Manager Loizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

Title: 3 Growth Stocks For The Next 5 Years
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-growth-stocks-for-next-5-years/
Time Published: 2025-02-02T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market ... [+] demand, positioning them for significant future growth. Investing in high-growth companies with a long-term perspective is a proven strategy for building wealth, but not all fast-growing companies are created equal. The opportunity lies in identifying stocks poised to capitalize on sustainable trends, with a minimal risk of degrading into obsolescence. The article highlights a small selection of growth stocks that meet these benchmarks. The selected stocks: Brazilian aerospace company Embraer (ERJ) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. It is popular for its single-aisle E175-E2 commercial planes, the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft and the Phenom 300, a top-seller in the light jet category for the last 12 years. The ERJ stock has climbed more than 125% in the past year, and returned to investment grade credit rating. Whether Embraer can disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, because of Boeing’s brutal year and Airbus’ supply-chain snags, is debatable. However, the Brazilian plane maker appears strategically positioned to capitalize on its robust order backlog and strong performance across all of its segments. 1. Strong backlog Embraer’s firm order backlog rose to $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking its highest level in the past nine years. This provides visibility for steady cash flow in the years ahead. 2. Rising deliveries despite supply chain constraints Embraer delivered 206 aircraft in 2024, up 14% from 181 in 2023. About 63%, or 130 of these, were executive jets. In 2023, the Brazilian aircraft maker delivered 115 executive jets, representing roughly the same 63% of overall deliveries. It is interesting to note that Embraer allows customers to design their own executive jets using a new aircraft configurator. The company continues to see double-digit growth for aircraft deliveries, revenue and EBIT in 2025 and beyond, even as it navigates its supply chain constraints. 3. Attractive economics of E2 jets position it well for replacement opportunities Embraer’s E195-E2 jets are gaining traction in the Commercial Aviation sector, due to their superior economics and passenger-friendly design, including no middle seats and 40% larger overhead bins. The E195-E2 will feature automatic takeoff, an industry-first, before the end of this year, and can operate from shorter runways. Embraer’s E2 family offers 16% lower fuel consumption compared to its first-generation E-Jets, and 25.4% better fuel efficiency per seat. In 2024, Embraer sold 47 E195/E190-E2 jets and 26 E175 jets, up from 39 and 25, respectively, in 2023. The growing need to replace 3,000+ small narrow-body aircraft worldwide presents a significant opportunity for the E2 family over the next few years. The efficient E195-E2 is profitable at a ~80% load factor, a dynamic that highlights its potential as a preferred choice for both mainline and low-cost carriers, looking to expand connectivity to secondary cities. The number of cities without service or served less than once daily has increased from 49 in 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 85 in 2023, highlighting a significant opportunity for the E2 family’s capabilities. U.S. airlines are unable to operate the higher-capacity E195-E2 that has a maximum of 146 seats, due to the scope clause in contracts between airlines and pilots’ unions that limits the number of passengers a regional aircraft can carry to 76. If the scope clause is ratified, it may open the floodgates of the U.S. commercial aviation market for the E2 jets. 4. Solid spot in defense Embraer’s Defense & Security segment continues to perform well, delivering three new generation military multi-mission transport aircraft, the C-390 Millennium, in 2024, up from two in 2023. Embraer’s light attack aircraft A-29 Super Tucano is also seeing strong demand, with over 290 orders. Growing geopolitical complexity across the globe may boost defence budgets, and Embraer may be in the right spot to benefit. 5. Reclaiming investment-grade rating Embraer has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past three years, lowering its net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.3x in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.9x in 2021 (and 20.7x in 2020). It has no relevant debt to be paid back during the next 2.5 years. The continued improvement in credit metrics has helped the Brazilian airplane-maker return completely to investment-grade rating in 2024. 6. Accolades from customers, analysts Embraer’s reputation for reliability has earned praise from customers like American Airlines. In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s. Bank of America analysts highlighted the fact that Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects between 1999 and 2019, calling it “an engineering marvel.” 7. Plans for a new jet rivaling Boeing’s 737 Embraer may reportedly be mulling a new jet to compete with Boeing 737. The Wall Street Journal reported that Embraer is holding talks with potential partners and financial backers on its plans for a new narrow-body aircraft. If reports are to be believed, and everything goes as planned, then Embraer will likely take off to new heights. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the U.S. stock market, with its stock soaring nearly 1900% in the past five years, despite recent volatilities. This remarkable surge is driven by the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which power nearly all advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, recent DeepSeek revelations have created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day, and unseating it from its pedestal as the most valuable company in the world. DeepSeek, reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals, has sparked questions about the continued need for Nvidia’s high-performance and expensive chips. Despite these concerns, I continue to believe that Nvidia is a more reliable bet on the future of AI. 1. Geopolitical and regulatory risks with DeepSeek DeepSeek hails from China, and that definitely adds a layer of complexity. The Chinese government’s influence over domestic tech companies, coupled with the potential for sudden regulatory actions, poses a significant risk for investors, especially in light of what happened with companies like Alibaba. Additionally, given the U.S.’s pattern of banning or restricting Chinese tech companies (like TikTok) over national security concerns, a similar fate may await DeepSeek, as the stakes around data privacy and security are even higher with AI technology that handles huge volumes of data. This could potentially hinder DeepSeek’s global scalability. 2. Unproven claims on cost efficiency DeepSeek claims spending a mere $5.57 million to develop its model, representing a fraction of LLAMA 3.1’s $500 million, but analysts have dismissed this figure, noting it overlooks substantial hidden costs. DeepSeek’s alleged use of 10,000 A100 GPUs may also be inflated, with reports suggesting as many as 50,000 Hopper GPUs were used, which in turn could raise concerns given the ongoing "GPU embargo.” 3. Lack of transparency DeepSeek clamming up on politically-sensitive questions related to China, but showing willingness to slam Biden and Trump, further distinguishes it from open-source AI models like ChatGPT, which are more transparent and accountable. DeepSeek’s opacity raises doubts about its commitment to openness and responsible AI practices. 4. Nvidia: an established AI ecosystem DeepSeek is an AI startup, but Nvidia is an AI leader. Nvidia’s strength lies not just in its GPUs, but in its deep and integrated AI ecosystem, including its strategic partnerships and the CUDA platform – the gold standard for GPU acceleration in AI development. Shifting away from CUDA would pose an immense challenge for competitors, giving Nvidia a significant competitive edge. Nvidia itself expressed no existential angst, calling DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning model R1 "an excellent AI advancement.” Nvidia’s AI leadership, strong economic moat and proactive product innovation position it for continued growth. 1. Nvidia’s primary economic moat is its innovation Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. The company transformed its graphics processors into powerful AI chips, sparking unprecedented growth. By targeting the right end markets for its Omniverse platform, Nvidia succeeded where Meta struggled with its Metaverse ventures. The impenetrable CUDA armor is a further testimony to its Midas Touch. 2. Blackwell GPU demand outpacing expectations Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell GPUs are already in high demand, outstripping supply by a factor of 15. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives notes that Nvidia can supply only one chip for every 15 chips customers are looking to buy. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley sees Blackwell GPUs adding $15 billion to Nvidia's sales in the current quarter, with the potential to double in the next quarter. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri now sees Blackwell revenues of $9 billion for the January quarter vs. prior expectations of $5 billion, with sales rising in the next few years. 3. NVIDIA’s sovereign AI initiatives gathering momentum as India, Japan sign up NVIDIA’s Sovereign AI initiatives are gaining significant traction as India and Japan embrace the company’s accelerated computing for a new era of AI-driven industrial transformation. India’s Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including Tata Communications, are constructing AI factories, with Nvidia GPU deployments in the country expected to increase nearly 10x by year-end. Japan is building its most powerful AI supercomputer using Nvidia’s DGX Blackwell. 4. Immense growth potential in autonomous vehicles and robotics Nvidia’s Automotive and Robotics segment posted third-quarter revenues of $449 million, a small fraction vs. its record data center revenues of $30.8 billion. However, with its Cosmos foundation models, Nvidia is poised for massive growth in the autonomous vehicles and robotics sectors. Cosmos foundation models generate photo-realistic video to facilitate the training of robots and self-driving vehicles at a significantly reduced cost vs. using traditional data. Huang notes “We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Llama 3 has done for enterprise AI. Analyst Ives sees Nvidia reaching a market cap of $5 trillion as it unlocks this underappreciated growth opportunity in Robotics and AVs. TSMC is a leading contract chip manufacturer, producing AI chips for major companies like Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and even Intel. TSMC’s foundry dominance is built on years of investment in cutting-edge process technologies, along with a commitment to a pure-play foundry model and a strategic policy of not competing with its clients. This has allowed TSMC to capture nearly 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market share, far outpacing Samsung, which holds just 9.3%. TSMC’s near monopoly in producing advanced chips for AI and other futuristic technologies, coupled with its relentless push for smaller nodes and more efficient processes sets it a class apart. 1. Pole positioning as a critical AI enabler TSMC enjoys unparalleled leadership in the production of advanced semiconductors powering AI and data centers because of its superior process technology, strong foundry design ecosystem and reputation as a consistent and reliable chip maker. This unique positioning gives it pricing power and the confidence to set a target for long-term gross margins of 53% and higher. TSMC is reportedly looking at a 5% hike in wafer prices for 2025. The company affirmed that it sells its U.S.-made wafers at a slight premium to Taiwan-made ones, because of the higher cost structure in the U.S. 2. AI accelerators to drive 5-year growth Revenue from AI accelerators, including AI GPU, AI6, and HBM controller for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of TSMC’s total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, revenue from AI accelerators is expected to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues. TSMC forecasts revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period from 2024. AI accelerators are seen as the strongest driver of TSMC’s High Performance Computing (HPC) platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 3. Long-term revenue growth at a 20% CAGR For the five-year period starting from 2024, TSMC expects long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms, fueled by all of its growth platforms – smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive. 4. Strong U.S. relationships For the skeptics worried about the U.S. export curbs on chips, it would be good to know that TSMC emphasizes its long-standing, good relationship with the U.S., and is building fabs in Arizona. Its first fab in Arizona has already entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of 2024, utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to its fabs in Taiwan. TSMC’s plans for two more fabs in Arizona are also on track. These fabs will use advanced technologies such as N3, N2, and A16. 5. Upcoming 2-nm node presents strong potential TSMC’s Industry-leading 2-nanometer and A16 technologies meet the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing. N2 is well on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. Other future offerings like N2P and A16 that are scheduled for volume production in the second half of 2026, feature further performance and power benefits over N2. Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market demand, positioning them for significant future growth. However, these companies don’t simply rest on their laurels; they continue to innovate ensuring their growth drivers remain relevant and impactful over the long term. With AI driving the growth narrative forward, Nvidia and TSMC are key beneficiaries. Embraer is well positioned to benefit as it serves a critical sector with its much-needed solid engineering capabilities amid strong demand dynamics, and its ability to successfully navigate supply chain constraints.

Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market ... [+] demand, positioning them for significant future growth. Investing in high-growth companies with a long-term perspective is a proven strategy for building wealth, but not all fast-growing companies are created equal. The opportunity lies in identifying stocks poised to capitalize on sustainable trends, with a minimal risk of degrading into obsolescence. The article highlights a small selection of growth stocks that meet these benchmarks. The selected stocks: Brazilian aerospace company Embraer (ERJ) produces a fleet of commercial, business and defense jets. It is popular for its single-aisle E175-E2 commercial planes, the C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft and the Phenom 300, a top-seller in the light jet category for the last 12 years. The ERJ stock has climbed more than 125% in the past year, and returned to investment grade credit rating. Whether Embraer can disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, because of Boeing’s brutal year and Airbus’ supply-chain snags, is debatable. However, the Brazilian plane maker appears strategically positioned to capitalize on its robust order backlog and strong performance across all of its segments. 1. Strong backlog Embraer’s firm order backlog rose to $22.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, marking its highest level in the past nine years. This provides visibility for steady cash flow in the years ahead. 2. Rising deliveries despite supply chain constraints Embraer delivered 206 aircraft in 2024, up 14% from 181 in 2023. About 63%, or 130 of these, were executive jets. In 2023, the Brazilian aircraft maker delivered 115 executive jets, representing roughly the same 63% of overall deliveries. It is interesting to note that Embraer allows customers to design their own executive jets using a new aircraft configurator. The company continues to see double-digit growth for aircraft deliveries, revenue and EBIT in 2025 and beyond, even as it navigates its supply chain constraints. 3. Attractive economics of E2 jets position it well for replacement opportunities Embraer’s E195-E2 jets are gaining traction in the Commercial Aviation sector, due to their superior economics and passenger-friendly design, including no middle seats and 40% larger overhead bins. The E195-E2 will feature automatic takeoff, an industry-first, before the end of this year, and can operate from shorter runways. Embraer’s E2 family offers 16% lower fuel consumption compared to its first-generation E-Jets, and 25.4% better fuel efficiency per seat. In 2024, Embraer sold 47 E195/E190-E2 jets and 26 E175 jets, up from 39 and 25, respectively, in 2023. The growing need to replace 3,000+ small narrow-body aircraft worldwide presents a significant opportunity for the E2 family over the next few years. The efficient E195-E2 is profitable at a ~80% load factor, a dynamic that highlights its potential as a preferred choice for both mainline and low-cost carriers, looking to expand connectivity to secondary cities. The number of cities without service or served less than once daily has increased from 49 in 2019 (pre-pandemic) to 85 in 2023, highlighting a significant opportunity for the E2 family’s capabilities. U.S. airlines are unable to operate the higher-capacity E195-E2 that has a maximum of 146 seats, due to the scope clause in contracts between airlines and pilots’ unions that limits the number of passengers a regional aircraft can carry to 76. If the scope clause is ratified, it may open the floodgates of the U.S. commercial aviation market for the E2 jets. 4. Solid spot in defense Embraer’s Defense & Security segment continues to perform well, delivering three new generation military multi-mission transport aircraft, the C-390 Millennium, in 2024, up from two in 2023. Embraer’s light attack aircraft A-29 Super Tucano is also seeing strong demand, with over 290 orders. Growing geopolitical complexity across the globe may boost defence budgets, and Embraer may be in the right spot to benefit. 5. Reclaiming investment-grade rating Embraer has significantly deleveraged its balance sheet over the past three years, lowering its net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 1.3x in the third quarter of 2024 from 3.9x in 2021 (and 20.7x in 2020). It has no relevant debt to be paid back during the next 2.5 years. The continued improvement in credit metrics has helped the Brazilian airplane-maker return completely to investment-grade rating in 2024. 6. Accolades from customers, analysts Embraer’s reputation for reliability has earned praise from customers like American Airlines. In an earnings call last year, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom extolled Embraer. “I want to give a shout out to Embraer,” Isom said. “They have delivered day in and day out, throughout the pandemic, no matter the concerns of their supply chain.” American’s regional jet fleet comprises 302 Embraer aircraft and that includes 210 E175s. Bank of America analysts highlighted the fact that Embraer was largely on time and on budget with its projects between 1999 and 2019, calling it “an engineering marvel.” 7. Plans for a new jet rivaling Boeing’s 737 Embraer may reportedly be mulling a new jet to compete with Boeing 737. The Wall Street Journal reported that Embraer is holding talks with potential partners and financial backers on its plans for a new narrow-body aircraft. If reports are to be believed, and everything goes as planned, then Embraer will likely take off to new heights. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the U.S. stock market, with its stock soaring nearly 1900% in the past five years, despite recent volatilities. This remarkable surge is driven by the skyrocketing demand for Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which power nearly all advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, recent DeepSeek revelations have created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day, and unseating it from its pedestal as the most valuable company in the world. DeepSeek, reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its U.S. rivals, has sparked questions about the continued need for Nvidia’s high-performance and expensive chips. Despite these concerns, I continue to believe that Nvidia is a more reliable bet on the future of AI. 1. Geopolitical and regulatory risks with DeepSeek DeepSeek hails from China, and that definitely adds a layer of complexity. The Chinese government’s influence over domestic tech companies, coupled with the potential for sudden regulatory actions, poses a significant risk for investors, especially in light of what happened with companies like Alibaba. Additionally, given the U.S.’s pattern of banning or restricting Chinese tech companies (like TikTok) over national security concerns, a similar fate may await DeepSeek, as the stakes around data privacy and security are even higher with AI technology that handles huge volumes of data. This could potentially hinder DeepSeek’s global scalability. 2. Unproven claims on cost efficiency DeepSeek claims spending a mere $5.57 million to develop its model, representing a fraction of LLAMA 3.1’s $500 million, but analysts have dismissed this figure, noting it overlooks substantial hidden costs. DeepSeek’s alleged use of 10,000 A100 GPUs may also be inflated, with reports suggesting as many as 50,000 Hopper GPUs were used, which in turn could raise concerns given the ongoing "GPU embargo.” 3. Lack of transparency DeepSeek clamming up on politically-sensitive questions related to China, but showing willingness to slam Biden and Trump, further distinguishes it from open-source AI models like ChatGPT, which are more transparent and accountable.

TSMC is a leading contract chip manufacturer, producing AI chips for major companies like Nvidia, Apple, Qualcomm, AMD and even Intel. TSMC’s foundry dominance is built on years of investment in cutting-edge process technologies, along with a commitment to a pure-play foundry model and a strategic policy of not competing with its clients. This has allowed TSMC to capture nearly 65% of the global semiconductor foundry market share, far outpacing Samsung, which holds just 9.3%. TSMC’s near monopoly in producing advanced chips for AI and other futuristic technologies, coupled with its relentless push for smaller nodes and more efficient processes sets it a class apart. 1. Pole positioning as a critical AI enabler TSMC enjoys unparalleled leadership in the production of advanced semiconductors powering AI and data centers because of its superior process technology, strong foundry design ecosystem and reputation as a consistent and reliable chip maker. This unique positioning gives it pricing power and the confidence to set a target for long-term gross margins of 53% and higher. TSMC is reportedly looking at a 5% hike in wafer prices for 2025. The company affirmed that it sells its U.S.-made wafers at a slight premium to Taiwan-made ones, because of the higher cost structure in the U.S. 2. AI accelerators to drive 5-year growth Revenue from AI accelerators, including AI GPU, AI6, and HBM controller for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of TSMC’s total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, revenue from AI accelerators is expected to double in 2025 as the strong surge in AI-related demand continues. TSMC forecasts revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period from 2024. AI accelerators are seen as the strongest driver of TSMC’s High Performance Computing (HPC) platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. 3. Long-term revenue growth at a 20% CAGR For the five-year period starting from 2024, TSMC expects long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms, fueled by all of its growth platforms – smartphone, HPC, IoT and automotive. 4. Strong U.S. relationships For the skeptics worried about the U.S. export curbs on chips, it would be good to know that TSMC emphasizes its long-standing, good relationship with the U.S., and is building fabs in Arizona. Its first fab in Arizona has already entered high-volume production in the fourth quarter of 2024, utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to its fabs in Taiwan. TSMC’s plans for two more fabs in Arizona are also on track. These fabs will use advanced technologies such as N3, N2, and A16. 5. Upcoming 2-nm node presents strong potential TSMC’s Industry-leading 2-nanometer and A16 technologies meet the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing. N2 is well on track for volume production in the second half of 2025. Other future offerings like N2P and A16 that are scheduled for volume production in the second half of 2026, feature further performance and power benefits over N2. Embraer, Nvidia and TSMC share key strengths, such as a wide competitive moat and huge market demand, positioning them for significant future growth. However, these companies don’t simply rest on their laurels; they continue to innovate ensuring their growth drivers remain relevant and impactful over the long term. With AI driving the growth narrative forward, Nvidia and TSMC are key beneficiaries. Embraer is well positioned to benefit as it serves a critical sector with its much-needed solid engineering capabilities amid strong demand dynamics, and its ability to successfully navigate supply chain constraints.

Title: 3 High-Yield Closed End Funds To Buy Tech Stocks For Less

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: 3 High-Yield Closed End Funds To Buy Tech Stocks For Less

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs.

Title: What's in store for remote work and RTO in 2025: 'Hybrid will be dominant,' says expert
URL: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/02/whats-in-store-for-remote-work-and-rto-in-2025.html
Time Published: 2025-02-02T14:30:01Z

Related Stories With the new year comes new goals, and for some CEOs that includes issuing fresh return-to-office mandates for their workers. In recent months, companies like Amazon, AT&T, Boeing, Dell and Walmart have called select staffers into the office five days a week. RTO marching orders reached the White House after President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing all department and agency heads in the executive branch to "terminate remote work arrangements" and require workers report to offices full-time "as soon as practicable." Shortly after, the Trump administration offered buyouts to nearly all civilian federal workers to quit by Feb. 6. The trend could trigger waves of quitting and disengagement at work, though, experts warn, especially among high performers. Nearly half, 46%, of hybrid and remote workers said they would be unlikely to stay in their job if their employer called them back to offices full-time, according to a Pew Research Center survey of more than 5,200 people in October. Some companies may hope that work-from-home holdouts will quit rather than comply. Companies that plan to cut hiring significantly are more likely to impose RTO mandates than expand remote-work opportunities, according to research from ZipRecruiter; they also report higher turnover rates. In the past, the workers most likely to quit after the institution of an RTO mandate tended to be highly skilled and tenured star employees, according to research from the University of Pittsburgh. The study, which analyzed companies in the S&P 500, found firms that cut workplace flexibility experienced "abnormally high turnover," especially among women, senior and skilled employees. These companies took "significantly longer" to fill vacancies and saw their hire rates "significantly decrease," researchers noted. Thanks to a tougher job market for workers than a few years ago, those who want to quit but don't have anywhere to go are likely to stay and be a drain on worker engagement, says Mark Ma, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. "I might try to do the minimum so I won't be fired, then start looking for the next job. And once I find a better position, I will leave," Ma says. "So it's not an ideal situation for the employer." A better approach to reducing headcount is to conduct targeted layoffs of lower performers, Ma says. As of October 2024, a majority of workers, 53%, said finding a new job they want would be difficult, up from 37% of people who felt that way in 2022, according to Pew data. That's unlikely to entirely deter the nearly half of workers who would try to quit given stricter RTO mandates from their company. "It shows how much they really do value the flexibility that comes with hybrid work," says Kim Parker, director of social trends research at Pew Research Center. Generally, Ma expects "some form of hybrid will be dominant, rather than a five-day return-to-office." Of the S&P 500 firms he and his co-researchers studied in 2024, just 10 announced full-time returns for some of its staff throughout the year, he says. "Based on the data we are observing, I do not think the majority of companies will do that," he says. "Most firms have already figured out their hybrid policy by now. Unless something goes wrong, I don't think they will try to change that position." While 31% of businesses reduced remote-work options in 2024, 33% expanded them, according to ZipRecruiter data compiled from more than 2,000 hiring managers. Bigger companies may have more leverage to issue RTO requirements because they can offer more money and still attract a larger candidate pool, Ma says. However, smaller companies that can't offer as competitive pay might instead offer more flexibility as a non-salary benefit to attract hires. "Not many small firms are following," Ma says.

Title: Why Are Analysts Bullish on MGM Resorts International (MGM) Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Invest in According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks. 2024 was a memorable year for the broad market index, which posted a gain of 23.31%, building on the 24.2% return in 2023. The two-year surge of over 53% is the best performance for the index since the 66% rally between 1997 and 1998. READ ALSO: 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025. The stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power. The broader market rose 0.5% on January 23, going past its peak in December to a new record high. The gain added to the week-long winning momentum after data showed inflation slowing in the country more than economists had anticipated. With this rise, the index is up 4% since the start of the year. Investor sentiment has also been bolstered with President Trump reiterating his commitment to lowering oil prices and further cutting interest rates. The 78-year-old is also taking his time over tariffs by holding them off until February. Analysts believe a less aggressive approach than some had expected has helped the market move higher. Here is what Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at the Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, had to say: "He really can’t control interest rates, but the market likes to hear that kind of stuff. So far, the market does seem to like what Trump’s policies are going to be, so we’ll just have to see if there’s some follow-through." A string of strong corporate earnings reports has also supported the gains in January. According to data from FactSet, earnings for companies listed on the index are on track to grow by over 12% for the fourth quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. If that happens, this would mark the best quarter for company profits since 2021. While the overall outlook for the stock market looks encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the rally having gone too far, and a correction is in the offing this year. The threat of fierce trade wars sparked by tariffs, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, and broader inflationary pressures could also hurt the market. Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro for Fidelity Management & Research Company wrote the following in a note on December 18. "Personally, I am bullish on stocks for 2025, though with valuations high and the bull market maturing, I don’t think investors should expect quite such spectacular returns next year as we have seen this past year. And I think there are important risks from inflation, and the market’s concentration, to be aware of." For this article, we went through the list of large cap stocks on the broader market index and picked the top 12 with the highest average share price upside potential. All data is as of the close of the day on Friday, January 31, 2025. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their share price upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Average Share Price Upside Potential as of January 31: 51.60% Market Cap: $10.27 billion MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is an American hospitality, sports, and entertainment company with a significant presence in domestic and international locations. Its segments include Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China. The company’s properties offer hotels, casinos, meetings and conference spaces, dining, gaming, nightlife and other facilities.

It is also exploring opportunities in other markets in the region, including the United Arab Emirates and Thailand. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is also capitalizing on the online sports betting and iGaming markets through BetMGM, its 50% joint venture with Entain. BetMGM had an impressive third quarter of fiscal 2024, during which it achieved profitability, record iGaming results, and a 70% increase in first-time depositors. Moreover, MGM boasts a healthy return on equity in the high teens and generates substantial free cash flow, which allows the company to reinvest in its business, execute share repurchase programs, and enhance shareholder value. This has resulted in a general bullish sentiment around the stock. Wall Street analysts have a consensus Strong Buy rating for MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) with an average share price upside potential of nearly 52%, making it one of the best large-cap stocks to invest in according to analysts. Investor sentiment is seeing an improvement as well. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024, 46 hedge funds held a stake in the company, up from 44 at the end of the second quarter. Overall MGM ranks 7th on our list of the best S&P 500 stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MGM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Trump tariffs, more Big Tech earnings, and a jobs report: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks swiftly recovered from the DeepSeek-driven sell-off early in the week but came under pressure on Monday amid concerns over President Trump's tariff plans. Trump followed through with his plans on Saturday, placing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4. There will be 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China, over issues of fentanyl and illegal migration. Markets are digesting the tariff announcements after a strong start to the year. In January, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 2.7% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced more than 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 4.7%. In the week ahead, investors will parse the latest developments in Trump's tariff strategy, the January jobs report, and an onslaught of corporate reports. Updates on job openings, as well as activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also be on the schedule. Meanwhile, quarterly results from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Chipotle (CMG), and Eli Lilly (LLY) headline a week that will feature earnings reports from 131 S&P 500 companies. Tariff reaction will be at the forefront of the market narrative in the week ahead. The duties on all three countries will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4, according to the order signed by Trump on Saturday afternoon in Florida. Many economists have argued that tariffs could stoke inflation. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Canada and Mexico were quick to announce retaliatory measures across a range of US goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will place 25% counter-tariffs on CAD $155 billion (USD $107 billion) worth of American-made products, starting Tuesday. Stocks are on track for steep losses to start the week, after their rally cooled off on Friday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlined the plans for imposing tariffs. Trump following through with the extent of tariffs he had initially threatened "may be further" than market participants had been expecting, Evercore ISI chief strategist for international affairs and public policy Sarah Bianci told Yahoo Finance. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as it waits for further clarity on inflation's path toward its 2% target and how potential tariffs could impact that process. The week ahead will bring several key updates for the Fed on the employment side of its mandate. The January jobs report, due out Friday morning, is expected to show the US labor market added 150,000 jobs in the month, down from the 256,000 seen in December. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%. The report will also include revisions to labor data from the past year. "We suspect the January jobs report will continue to indicate the labor market has softened over the past year, but not to an alarming degree," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients Friday. While the labor market has held up for now, with inflation moving slowly toward the Fed's target, some on Wall Street believe signs of significant slowing would be the most likely catalyst to prompt the central bank to resume its rate-cutting cycle. "We think the unemployment rate is probably the single most important macro data point you're going to get every month," Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance. "If you see a significant uptick in the unemployment rate, that potentially puts the Fed under pressure and puts the market under pressure as well." Less than halfway through the reporting period, the S&P 500 is currently pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 13.2% for the fourth quarter, which would mark the fastest rate of growth in three years for the benchmark index. This is higher than the 11.8% growth consensus had expected on Dec. 31, per FactSet data. And FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters points out this reporting season has been a particularly strong one for companies that are surprising Wall Street to the upside with their earnings per share numbers. Analyzing the two days leading into and following a report, companies that beat Wall Street's earnings expectations have seen their stocks rise 1.5% on average. This is above the five-year average of a 1% rise for companies that top earnings estimates. And it's not just this quarter's earnings surprising, either. Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha pointed out in a note to clients that at this point in the quarter, earnings estimates would usually have been cut 1.3%. Instead, they've only been trimmed by 0.6%. In other words, while noise about tariffs, inflation, and the overall path of monetary policy continues to dominate the discussion, the strong trend in earnings continues to be what's keeping Wall Street strategists bullish about the market outlook. "The most steady part of this bull market has been ... those earnings trends. Those forward earnings estimates every week are making new highs," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. "All in all, we think the bull market trend is intact, supported by these earnings that are somewhat still underappreciated." Another bullish sign for earnings may soon be flashing green too. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its ISM Manufacturing PMI. The reading has shown the sector in contraction for more than two years. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave believes the tide may be turning for manufacturing, though. "The manufacturing recession might be over, and we think the ISM manufacturing index is likely to break above 50 in January," Bhave wrote in a note to clients on Friday. This could be bullish for stocks, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee recently said in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook. "To me, the most important chart to watch is the ISM manufacturing turning up in 2025," Lee said. "This series has been below 50 for 26 months now, the longest stretch since 1989-1991, and we think [it] signals an acceleration of cyclical [earnings] growth in 2025." As Lee's chart shows, when ISM's manufacturing PMI picks up, earnings usually follow.

Title: Trump tariffs, more Big Tech earnings, and a jobs report: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks swiftly recovered from the DeepSeek-driven sell-off early in the week but came under pressure on Monday amid concerns over President Trump's tariff plans. Trump followed through with his plans on Saturday, placing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4. There will be 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China, over issues of fentanyl and illegal migration. Markets are digesting the tariff announcements after a strong start to the year. In January, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 2.7% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced more than 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 4.7%. In the week ahead, investors will parse the latest developments in Trump's tariff strategy, the January jobs report, and an onslaught of corporate reports. Updates on job openings, as well as activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also be on the schedule. Meanwhile, quarterly results from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Chipotle (CMG), and Eli Lilly (LLY) headline a week that will feature earnings reports from 131 S&P 500 companies. Tariff reaction will be at the forefront of the market narrative in the week ahead. The duties on all three countries will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4, according to the order signed by Trump on Saturday afternoon in Florida. Many economists have argued that tariffs could stoke inflation. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Canada and Mexico were quick to announce retaliatory measures across a range of US goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will place 25% counter-tariffs on CAD $155 billion (USD $107 billion) worth of American-made products, starting Tuesday. Stocks are on track for steep losses to start the week, after their rally cooled off on Friday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlined the plans for imposing tariffs. Trump following through with the extent of tariffs he had initially threatened "may be further" than market participants had been expecting, Evercore ISI chief strategist for international affairs and public policy Sarah Bianci told Yahoo Finance. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as it waits for further clarity on inflation's path toward its 2% target and how potential tariffs could impact that process. The week ahead will bring several key updates for the Fed on the employment side of its mandate. The January jobs report, due out Friday morning, is expected to show the US labor market added 150,000 jobs in the month, down from the 256,000 seen in December. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%. The report will also include revisions to labor data from the past year. "We suspect the January jobs report will continue to indicate the labor market has softened over the past year, but not to an alarming degree," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients Friday. While the labor market has held up for now, with inflation moving slowly toward the Fed's target, some on Wall Street believe signs of significant slowing would be the most likely catalyst to prompt the central bank to resume its rate-cutting cycle. "We think the unemployment rate is probably the single most important macro data point you're going to get every month," Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance. "If you see a significant uptick in the unemployment rate, that potentially puts the Fed under pressure and puts the market under pressure as well." Less than halfway through the reporting period, the S&P 500 is currently pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 13.2% for the fourth quarter, which would mark the fastest rate of growth in three years for the benchmark index. This is higher than the 11.8% growth consensus had expected on Dec. 31, per FactSet data. And FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters points out this reporting season has been a particularly strong one for companies that are surprising Wall Street to the upside with their earnings per share numbers. Analyzing the two days leading into and following a report, companies that beat Wall Street's earnings expectations have seen their stocks rise 1.5% on average. This is above the five-year average of a 1% rise for companies that top earnings estimates. And it's not just this quarter's earnings surprising, either. Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha pointed out in a note to clients that at this point in the quarter, earnings estimates would usually have been cut 1.3%. Instead, they've only been trimmed by 0.6%. In other words, while noise about tariffs, inflation, and the overall path of monetary policy continues to dominate the discussion, the strong trend in earnings continues to be what's keeping Wall Street strategists bullish about the market outlook. "The most steady part of this bull market has been ... those earnings trends. Those forward earnings estimates every week are making new highs," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. "All in all, we think the bull market trend is intact, supported by these earnings that are somewhat still underappreciated." Another bullish sign for earnings may soon be flashing green too. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its ISM Manufacturing PMI. The reading has shown the sector in contraction for more than two years. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave believes the tide may be turning for manufacturing, though. "The manufacturing recession might be over, and we think the ISM manufacturing index is likely to break above 50 in January," Bhave wrote in a note to clients on Friday. This could be bullish for stocks, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee recently said in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook. "To me, the most important chart to watch is the ISM manufacturing turning up in 2025," Lee said. "This series has been below 50 for 26 months now, the longest stretch since 1989-1991, and we think [it] signals an acceleration of cyclical [earnings] growth in 2025." As Lee's chart shows, when ISM's manufacturing PMI picks up, earnings usually follow. Monday Economic data: S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, January final (50.1 expected, 50.1 previously); Construction spending, month-over-month, December (0.2% expected, 0% prior); ISM manufacturing, January (49.3 expected, 49.3 prior) Earnings: The Clorox Company (CLX), Palantir (PLTR), Tyson (TSN) Tuesday Economic data: Job openings, December (8.01 million previously); Factory orders, December (+0.5% expected, -0.4% previously); Durable goods orders, December final (-2.2% previously), Capital Goods orders nondefense, excluding air, December final (+0.3% previously) Earnings: Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), AMD (AMD), Amgen (AMGN), Apollo (APO), Chipotle (CMG), Electronic Arts (EA), Enphase (ENPH), Estée Lauder (EL), Ferrari (RACE), Juniper Networks (JNPR), Merck (MRK), PayPal (PYPL), PepsiCo (PEP), Pfizer (PFE), Snap (SNAP), Spotify (SPOT) Wednesday Economic data: MBA mortgage applications, week ending Jan. 31 (-2% prior); ADP Private Payrolls, December (+153,000 expected, +111,000 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, January final (52.8 prior); S&P Global US composite PMI, January final (52.4 prior); ISM services index, January final (54.5 expected, 54.1 prior) Earnings: Disney (DIS), Aflac (AFL), Arm Holdings (ARM), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Boston Scientific (BSX), Ford (F), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Qualcomm (QCOM), Toyota (TM), Uber (UBER), Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) Thursday Economic data: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, January (+11.4% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 1 (207,000 previously) Earnings: Amazon (AMZN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Affirm (AFRM), e.lf.

Given these dynamics and the volatility in the stock market, it could be difficult for investors to pick the right stocks for their portfolios. Tracking the recommendations of top analysts could be helpful in this regard, as they look beyond short-term noise and focus on companies' long-term growth potential. With that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start with streaming giant Netflix (NFLX). The company recently impressed investors with better-than-anticipated results for the fourth quarter of 2024, reporting about 19 million subscriber additions. Reacting to the stellar Q4 print, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated a buy rating on NFLX stock and boosted the price target to $1,150 from $1,000, saying "NFLX enters the new year firing on all cylinders." Anmuth added that Netflix is gaining from a very solid content slate. While the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight, the Christmas Day NFL games and the second season of "Squid Game" were major content releases in Q4, the analyst noted the company's commentary that these three together accounted for only a small percentage of the overall subscriber additions and that the robust additions were driven by broad content strength. The analyst also highlighted that Netflix is witnessing enhanced engagement per member household and encouraging retention. Reacting to the company's decision to raise prices, Anmuth expects only a little pushback in the U.S. and a few other markets, given the strong content. Looking ahead, the analyst believes that the story this year will shift more towards advertising, with the company gearing up to pursue several initiatives. Overall, Anmuth is bullish on Netflix based on double-digit revenue growth estimates for 2025 and 2026, operating margin expansion, its dominant position in streaming, and expectations of a multi-year rise in free cash flow. He now expects 30 million net additions in 2025 compared to the previous estimate of 21 million. The analyst also increased his revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 4% and raised his operating profit estimate for both years by 13%. Anmuth ranks No. 80 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See Netflix Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks. This week's second stock pick is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a pioneer in robotic-assisted surgery and the maker of the popular da Vinci surgical systems. The company ended 2024 on a strong note, with market-beating earnings. However, ISRG's gross margin guidance for 2025 fell short of expectations and indicated contraction compared to 2024. In reaction to the results, JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus reaffirmed a buy rating on ISRG stock and increased the price target to $675 from $575. The analyst noted the company's upbeat profitability metrics and explained that the revenue beat was driven by solid gross system placements and procedure growth. In particular, Marcus noted the placement of 174 da Vinci 5 systems in Q4 2024, way ahead of JPMorgan's estimate of 125. "With strong momentum from dv5 heading into 2025 and a setup for another year of beat-and-raise quarters, we remain bullish on Intuitive and reiterate our Top Large Cap Pick," he said. Commenting on the 2025 outlook, Marcus stated that Intuitive Surgical's gross margin guidance of 67% to 68% slightly lagged JPMorgan's and the Street's estimate of about 68.5%. However, the analyst contended that while the gross margin guidance miss triggered some concerns, he sees the outlook as conservative, with a possible upside just as seen in 2024. He highlighted that ISRG's 2024 initial gross margin outlook was 67% to 68%, but it then ended the year favorably with a gross margin of nearly 69%. Overall, Marcus thinks that Intuitive Surgical is well positioned in the rapidly growing, underpenetrated soft-tissue robotics space. He expects the introduction of new systems and approval of the use of ISRG's systems in new procedures to drive future expansion. Marcus ranks No. 683 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.2%. See Intuitive Surgical Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at the cloud communications platform Twilio (TWLO). Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan upgraded TWLO stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $185 from $77 following the company's analyst day event and ahead of the fourth-quarter results in February. "Following multiple years of growth compression and several strategic actions, we believe Twilio is now hitting an inflection point both in terms of narrative and fundamentals," said Rangan, explaining the reason behind his rating upgrade. Further, Rangan expects solid free cash flow generation, supported by Twilio's aggressive cost reduction and efficiency measures. Rangan added that TWLO's analyst day reinforced his optimistic view, thanks to accelerated product velocity and an improved go-to-market strategy. The analyst thinks that enhancements to the company's Communications portfolio can help Twilio expand its already dominant position in the core CPaaS (communications platform as a Service) market. He thinks that following robust Q3 results, there is still notable upside in TWLO stock, driven by the company's strategic actions over the past two years. Also, Rangan sees a possible upside to the calendar year 2025 revenue growth estimates, given inflecting usage trends in communications and new product cross-sell opportunities, backed by core platform enhancements and generative AI innovations. Rangan ranks No. 345 among more than 9,300 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%. See Twilio Stock Charts on TipRanks.

Title: The Fed Just Confirmed A Huge Crypto Game-Changer As Trump Sparks Bitcoin Price Crash Fears

This post was originally published on February 2 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stalled after soaring higher following Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory—with fears suddenly emerging the $4 trillion crypto bubble could be about to pop. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin, helped by Elon Musk’s leaked plans for crypto in the White House. Now, as one legendary bitcoin trader warns of a looming “financial crisis,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has flung the door open for Wall Street to further adopt bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told banks they are permitted to offer bitcoin and ... [+] crypto to clients as fears emerge the bitcoin price could be on the verge of a crash. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed paused its interest rate cutting cycle. Wall Street banks “have to be pretty sure” their bitcoin and crypto activities are “safe and sound," Powell added. 02/03 update: Crypto prices have taken a huge step lower, wiping around $300 billion from the combined market that has been hard hit by the rapidly escalating trade war sparked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s volley of tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from China, Canada and Mexico. The tariffs, due to come into effect Tuesday morning, have also hit global stock markets, with investors balking at the prospect of tighter trading conditions. “A tidal wave of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has been unleashed across the cryptocurrency market after U.S. president Donald Trump’s Friday tariff announcement,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive crypto payment platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “The prospect of prolonged higher interest rates has rattled all global markets. While bitcoin has dropped below the $100,000 mark the King of Crypto is once again proving itself to be in a class of its own in marked contrast to altcoins bleeding dark red across the board.” Bitcoin plummeted overnight to just over $91,000, down almost 10% at its lowest, before rebounding to around $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies have seen far steeper declines, with ethereum down around 20% before recovering slightly and Ripple's XRP and ethereum rival cardano trading around similar levels. Solana, ethereum's biggest rival, has fared better, off by just 6% and exacerbating fears among ethereum holders that it could seize the altcoin crown. However, crypto traders have cheered analysis from Bitwise's investment guru Jeff Park, posted to X, who has outlined his thesis on why the coming trade war could be good for bitcoin. “Tariffs might be just a temporary tool, but the permanent conclusion is that bitcoin is not only going higher—but faster,” Park wrote, adding: “While both sides of the trade imbalance equation will want bitcoin for two different reasons, the end result is the same: higher, violently faster—for we are at war.” Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have leaned into bitcoin and crypto over the last year with a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helping to normalize bitcoin and crypto among the financial establishment. Powell’s comments mark a major shift in sentiment under Trump from the previous Biden administration that was hostile toward crypto. Under Biden, bitcoin and crypto companies complained of an unofficial policy to “debank” them, cutting off basic financial services and making it impossible to operate—which became known as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to a previous U.S. government policy to cut off industries believed to be at high risk of fraud and money laundering.

[+] the crypto market to around $4 trillion as Donald Trump bets on bitcoin and crypto. Trump’s adoption of bitcoin and crypto—starting with his non-fungible token (NFT) collections, growing to support for a U.S. bitcoin national stockpile and culminating with the launch of a controversial Trump-branded memecoin—has led to regulators and government agencies reversing their opposition to the technology. Meanwhile, Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to put steep tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China, setting the stage for a trade war that could spread around the world. Trump’s executive order will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, with a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and oil, and an additional 10% tariff on China, due to go into effect on Tuesday morning. “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash,” Robert Kiyosaki, investor and author of advice book Rich Dad Poor Dad, posted to X, pointing to Trump’s tariffs as the catalyst. “Good. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is debt, which will only get worse. Crashes mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer.” One Community. Many Voices.

The 72-year-old debated devoting her time to crafting and doting over her grandkids and even gave full-time retirement a try. But she soon realized her Social Security checks, which were smaller than her peers' due to time she spent out of the workforce while raising children, wouldn't be enough to cover travel or rising insurance costs on top of basic needs. Now, the Central Florida resident works part time as a remote contracting agent in local government. While she sometimes has to miss out on plans with fully retired friends, she said, continuing to work has kept her budget sound and her mind active. "It's just getting very hard to make ends meet," Wetherington said. "The way the world is right now, everything's going up, up, up." Wetherington is part of a growing body of Americans staying in the workforce past 65, once a traditional marker for retirement. This trend has buoyed the national labor market after years defined by pandemic-induced worker shortages and high quitting rates. It's also changed the financial outlook for those who remain employed in some capacity, whether for personal satisfaction or monetary need. This trend should be more apparent than ever in 2025, when more Americans are expected to turn 65 than in any past year, according to a widely read study from the Alliance for Lifetime Income. It dubbed a multiyear period in the late 2020s as the "Peak 65 zone." The number of employed Americans 65 and older ballooned more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By comparison, the labor force for all workers 16 or older has increased less than 9% during the same time period. That growth has meant workers ages 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024. That share is up from around 5.7% a decade ago. "It's really hard for many employers in many sectors to fill key workforce needs right now," said Jim Malatras, strategy chief at FedCap, a nonprofit that helps train and place people in jobs. Tapping this age group "can help build key capacity where it's desperately needed." While the swelling number of workers in this age bracket — more than 11 million in 2024 — has gained attention in recent years, the reasons for this outsized growth date back decades. Chief among the drivers is the fact that America's population is aging, according to Laura Quinby, an associate director at Boston College's Center for Retirement Research. But structural shifts in the retirement system have also encouraged working later in life, Quinby said. The transition in the private sector from employer-funded pensions to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans created a need for many workers to remain employed longer. Social Security reforms in the 1980s pushed the program's "full retirement age" from 65 to 67. "People really do use the Social Security full retirement age as an anchor in terms of when they should retire and claim benefits," Quinby said. "That shift triggered a trend in people working longer." Longer life spans have pushed a growing chorus of voices to call for the age of retirement to move back even further, especially as financial uncertainties swirl around Social Security. BlackRock Chair Larry Fink, for instance, said in an annual letter that it's "a bit crazy" that the expectation of retiring at 65 "originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire." Yet there are vastly different reasons and experiences for people of retirement age to continue working in some capacity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School's Retirement Equity Lab. Some do retire, and some continue to work in jobs that they love out of passion alone. But she said about two-thirds of those still working do it "because they have to." They can be in jobs with high physical or mental requirements, she said, but they see few alternatives, given that their Social Security checks can't sustain them. "I call it the tale of two retirements," Ghilarducci said. Employers of all kinds have tried to win and retain this growing base of talent. Booking.com parent Booking Holdings offers 10 days off annually for so-called grandparent leave, which is separate from time offered to new parents and other paid days off. Grocery store chain Wegmans has a section of its part-time jobs page specifically targeted to seniors, advertising the opportunity to stay active and earn income during retirement. Retirement-age workers can be seen working in gift shops or greeting restaurant guests for Xanterra, a travel company that owns properties in and around national parks. The company has a program called Helping Hands, which allows Xanterra to staff up during the peak tourist season by offering gigs that typically last a month and a half with 30-hour workweeks. "The retirement community, or that older workforce, is really an integral part of our overall workforce planning strategy," said Shannon Dierenbach, Xanterra's human resources chief. "They certainly bring a level of expertise, wisdom, life skills, perspective that really enhances the overall experience." Despite these anecdotes, advocates say a pervasive culture of ageism has continued to hurt these Americans in the workforce. "They're like vintage cars to us," said FedCap's Malatras. "They're built to last, they're full of value, but they're treated often like high-mileage Pintos, and they don't really have an opportunity to serve anymore." Employers hoping to better advertise to this community should look at job descriptions and pictures on their jobs pages to ensure there aren't any subtle signs they favor younger applicants, according to Heather Tinsley-Fix, senior advisor for employer engagement at AARP. She often encourages employers looking for older workers to sign AARP's pledge, in which businesses commit to measures supporting age equality. Removing college degree requirements can also help gain the attention of this pool, she said, given that a smaller share completed higher education compared with younger generations. Working from home is a key component of flexibility that these older workers may need, Tinsley-Fix said. Part of Tinsley-Fix's argument for employers is the impending "tsunami" of retirements expected within the next decade. If companies don't tap into groups they previously overlooked, she warned, they'll struggle to stay at full staffing, as not enough people enter the workforce each year to replace those who left. Her pitch isn't all doom-and-gloom, however. Tinsley-Fix said there's a silver lining: These workers tend to excel at soft skills and can provide mentorship to younger staffers. At Xanterra's sites, for example, retirement-age workers interact particularly well with customers and stay calm under pressure, Dierenbach said. "People talk about all kinds of spillover dividends from having older workers on their teams," Tinsley-Fix said. "They really benefit from having those folks." Those who remain employed do so for a variety of reasons. Multiple workers from this age group told CNBC that no matter the initial rationale — whether financial needs or personal preference — that got them to stay or return to the workforce, they've benefited physically and mentally. "It was the best thing that ever happened to me," said Shari Nelson, who began working for nonprofit Vantage Aging through its government-supported job placement program and was hired to stay on after completing it. The Ohio resident, who works part-time, said the paycheck allows her the financial security to be the kind of grandmother past generations in her family have been. Nelson's role was previously full-time, but Vantage broke it up into two positions with fewer hours to better accommodate older workers. Nonprofits were the most popular industry for workers in this age bracket at the end of 2024, with more than 1 out of every 12 in the sector, according to data from payroll platform Gusto. Among the small businesses using Gusto, the firm found the share of workers 65 or older has surged more than 50% since January 2019. Government is another popular area, according to Gusto. That's where Florida resident Anne Sallee, who was once a public official, found herself after she decided a full retirement wasn't for her. Sallee, who had a long career as a paralegal and now works as an economic development coordinator, said the return to in-person office work was a "shock" after more than a decade away. However, she said the personal benefits of having deadlines and a routine, as well as a passion for the role, keep her coming back. "I don't enjoy not having things I have to do," Sallee said. "I never envisioned the 'sit on the beach with your feet up and a cocktail' kind of lifestyle." Still, Sallee said she's taken some liberties that she may not have early in her career or when starting a new position. For instance, the 68-year-old avoids working overtime and takes a three-week vacation annually. "If that ever becomes a problem," she said of her yearly stretch of time off, "the vacation will take priority." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

For this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: DeepSeek Undermines Robust Earnings And Economic Growth

Despite overall better earnings and resilient U.S. economic growth, the announcement of DeepSeek ... [+] development and President Trump’s threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico caused crosscurrents in the markets. There remain many unanswered questions about DeepSeek, but there are some crucial investment implications of the technology regardless of the issues. (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) This week is the busiest of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with 130 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 77% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Four of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with another two coming this week. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite overall better earnings and resilient U.S. economic growth, the announcement of DeepSeek development and President Trump’s threatened tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico caused crosscurrents in the markets. The S&P 500 fell 1% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 lost 0.8%. Market Returns Though DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence large language model (LLM) was released in December 2024, it rattled the technology sector when it became the most downloaded application on the Apple store last week. There remain many unanswered questions about DeepSeek, but there are some crucial investment implications of the technology regardless of the issues. While DeepSeek almost certainly spent more than disclosed and may have utilized others’ intellectual property, their artificial intelligence model seems to provide competitive performance at a lower development cost using less electricity and less powerful semiconductor chips. Because DeepSeek is a Chinese company, its LLM is not likely to be used directly by U.S. companies. Still, it is open-source, so others here will undoubtedly use its innovations to build their models quickly. Before DeepSeek, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) was an arms race, with the thought that massive spending on infrastructure, electricity, data, and bleeding-edge semiconductor chips was needed to compete. NVIDIA (NVDA) was the most direct beneficiary of this environment, as the company is dominant in providing the most advanced AI chips. The innovations from DeepSeek have opened a new path for lower-cost AI models. While these models are less powerful, they could be offered to customers in a low or no-cost model. This has shifted the balance of market power between the developers and suppliers to large language models, and the companies are utilizing those models internally or offering them to consumers to favor the latter more than previously thought. The most striking example of this shift is the decline in NVIDIA (NVDA) last week, while Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) rose. All is not likely lost for companies like NVIDIA, however. There should still be robust demand for NVIDIA’s high-end chips because the most advanced AI applications will still require that computing power. In addition, the lower the price of artificial intelligence services, the more demand there will be over time. The shift is a reminder of capitalism's creative destruction, especially regarding new technology. DeepSeek - Tech Sector Impact According to FactSet data, the communication services and technology sectors contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Meta Platforms (META) was the most significant contributor to communication services, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) being the most critical contributors to the technology sector. On the other side of the ledger, earnings misses by Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) were the most significant detractors within industrials. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by technology and communications services. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-nine percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.6% has met expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Fourth-Quarter Estimated Sales Growth By Sector Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for communication services and banks, the blended earnings performance improved last week and has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +13.2% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remain the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) reported last week, with all but Tesla besting consensus estimates. Market reaction was more mixed as Microsoft’s cloud earnings growth was disappointing, and the promise of Tesla robotaxis helped cushion the missed earnings. In addition, the DeepSeek introduction added to the difficulty in attributing this week’s price performance to earnings. This week, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) report after the close on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. The forward earnings guidance and implications for artificial intelligence spending will be watched closely. Beyond the Magnificent 7, other notable companies reporting are Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), PepsiCo (PEP), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Walt Disney (DIS), and Eli Lilly (LLY). Magnificent 7: Earnings Growth Last week, headline economic growth was reported at a below-consensus 2.3% in the fourth quarter, but the details painted a prettier picture of the economic situation. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which excludes government spending, exports, and any change in inventories, grew by 3.2%, which is evidence that spending by households and businesses remained robust in the quarter. GDP: U.S. Economic Growth As widely expected, the Federal Reserve did not change short-term interest rates. Due to good economic momentum and above-target inflation, the Fed is not expected to alter monetary policy until mid-year. Currently, expectations are for a total of two 25 basis point (0.25%) reductions in 2025. The monthly jobs report on Friday will be closely watched as jobs are the canary in the coal mine for economic growth. Struggling economic growth outside the U.S. and the possible impacts of tariffs adds further uncertainty to any outlook. Expected Fed Rate Cuts The earnings from technology and communication services didn’t disappoint, but the story was upended by the DeepSeek news. Two more Magnificent 7 companies, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), report earnings this week, and their earnings and forward guidance will be crucial. DeepSeek shows that the end of the artificial intelligence story has not yet been written so that investors will monitor the situation closely. In addition to being the busiest week of the earnings season, the tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, along with Friday’s monthly jobs report, could add to the market volatility.

Title: 'Tyranny of high expectations': A veteran investment chief explains why he's quietly cutting exposure to US stocks, even though he's optimistic about the economy and AI

Many of the market's biggest fears may be overblown, though the head of global multi-asset at T. Rowe Price is starting to scale out of US stocks anyway. Investment chief Sébastien Page recently told Business Insider that he's not worried about economic growth, even though fourth-quarter GDP just came in lighter than expected. GDP still more than doubled consensus estimates in 2024, he noted. Corporate earnings, spending, and the unemployment rate also look healthy, and that's before tax cuts and deregulation. It's also too soon to say that China-based DeepSeek's highly effective chatbot will send artificial intelligence spending spiraling, Page said. After speaking with T. Rowe Price's tech analysts, the 25-year market veteran concluded there's no need to panic about DeepSeek. "The economy looks fine, earnings are looking to grow at 15%, and you still have a lot of AI spending that's actually going to increase maybe by 20%, based on our analyst estimates," Page said in an interview. However, Page also said US equities don't look as attractive after a massive multi-year rally. His main concern is the same as it was last fall: Markets are already pricing in plenty of good news. The S&P 500's forward earnings ratio is in the 95th to 98th percentile historically, he noted, but it pales in comparison to that of mega-cap growth stocks. This group's valuations are even more stretched now than they were in mid-November, following the postelection market surge. Even if all goes well with the economy, which Page sees as likely but far from certain, US stocks could fall short of lofty expectations if investors are underwhelmed by earnings. That's why as markets march ever-higher, Page said he's increasingly inclined to take money off the table. "We're still overweight stocks, but we're starting to reduce that overweight," Page said. "We're determining our risk-on positioning. I think as markets continue to rally, we'll continue to fade our overweight to go back to neutral-weight — not get out of stocks completely, just get back to neutral-weight. So that's how we're playing this right now." It's hard to poke a hole in fourth-quarter earnings results, at least so far. Profits have exceeded estimates and are up about 10% so far, according to Bank of America. Big-tech earnings were more of a mixed bag, as Meta pleased investors while Microsoft and Apple had some red flags. While some companies have issued timid forward guidance, the Street thinks earnings will rise at a mid-teen rate in 2025. If analysts are right, stocks could be in for another strong year. "The forecast for the next 12 months is that earnings are going to grow at 15% — that's a high bar," Page said. "So if you want to be an optimist, we can say, 'Look, we don't even need P/E expansion; we don't even need valuations to go higher. If just earnings come through, we can get double-digit stock returns.'" But companies have almost no room for error, Page said, considering where valuations are in the face of interest rates that are now expected to stay at restrictive levels for a longer time. So unless quarterly results meet or exceed an exceedingly high bar, US stocks could take a big hit. "I call it the 'tyranny of high expectations,'" Page said. "Meaning, the expectations for earnings growth are so high that you set yourself up for missing the mark." Cheaper value stocks are among the safest places to be in this expensive market, Page said. The market has fallen by 1% or more 17 times in the last 200 trading sessions, Page noted. In each of those instances, stocks with a value tilt have outperformed their growth-oriented peers, he said. That means value stocks are a better bet during selloffs, and have rebound potential. "Projecting forward 12 months, I would ascribe at least as much upside in value as in growth, given the valuation differential and the broadening fundamentals," Page said. "So to be overweight value I think is an interesting less-downside/same-upside kind of trade." However, that's not to say that the investment chief is bearish on growth stocks. The AI trade isn't over, Page said, as cheaper, better AI can actually cause its adoption rate to accelerate. "I would own both growth and value; tech and non-tech," Page said. "I think we're probably approaching peak concentration. So in our portfolios, we have a slight overweight to value stocks. We think growth stocks are still a very good long-term investment." With that said, stocks in economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials, and materials are strong bets because their valuations are reasonable, and the gap between their earnings growth and those of tech firms is narrowing. The same is true of healthcare stocks, he noted. Outside of the US, investors should stay selective. Page isn't overly bullish on international stocks but said less-heralded markets like Japan, Argentina, and Brazil are worth a look. In short, Page said his best advice for the next 11 months is the same as it usually is. "I don't really like to say, 'Stay invested; stay diversified,' because it's sort of an answer you can give at any point in time," Page said. "If you think about that statement, you could put it on a fortune cookie." But in this richly valued and ever-shifting stock market, that truism rings especially true. "I expect markets to broaden, hence the 'stay diversified,' and I think the economy and earnings will do just fine, hence the 'stay invested,'" Page said. "So when someone asks you in an elevator, 'Hey, you're an investment person,' what should you say? Just say that. And it actually works quite well right now." Jump to

Title: Big Pharma has a big Super Bowl dilemma

Big Pharma often turns to NFL games to hawk their blockbuster treatments, but drug makers have typically been hesitant to advertise during the big game. This hesitation could mean pharmaceutical companies are missing out on a major opportunity to connect with viewers, according to a new analysis by the TV outcomes firm EDO. Novo Nordisk (NVO-1.91%) alone aired a total of 16 commercials for its mega-popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy during games in the 2024-2045 NFL regular season, resulting in nearly 283 million impressions, according to data from EDO. Pfizer (PFE-1.04%) ran 10 ads for its COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, generating over 147 million impressions. Considering these numbers, you would think prescription drug companies would be jumping to air ads on what is typically the most-watched broadcast in America. Yet, there are a number of reasons drug companies have been reluctant to air ads during the Super Bowl. In addition to cost — a 30-second spot during the Super Bowl has surged to $8 million, viewers generally expect commercials airing during the game to be entertaining and light-hearted. This can be a difficult balance for prescription drug ads to land when they are required to list off all their potential side effects. EDO head of client solutions Laura Grover said that the ads’ big price tag may also not be worth it for drugs that treat conditions with a small incidence rate — a measurement of new cases of a disease over time. “The Super Bowl is a great tool to reach a lot of people at the same time and you do pay a premium for that,” said Grover. “So, if you’re focused on a drug that has a very small incidence rate, it may not be the best investment.” Super Bowl ads can also elevate scrutiny of Big Pharma. In 2016, AstraZeneca (AZN-0.85%) and Daiichi Sankyo bought prominent ad space to market a drug to treat opioid-induced constipation. The White House and at least two police chiefs responded, saying the companies should’ve warned viewers about opioid addiction instead of constipation. Between 1999–2019, the CDC recorded half a million deaths in the U.S. linked to opioid overdoses. For drug makers attempting to cash in on the Super Bowl, the prime ad spot can have a big pay off, especially when it comes to viewer engagement with a brand. “The Super Bowl is a different type of viewing,” said Grover. “People are tuning in for the ads just as much as the game.” Only two prescription drug companies aired ads during last year’s Super Bowl festivities: Pfizer and Astellas, which aired an ad during the pre-game broadcast. Pfizer aired a 60-second spot that promoted the company’s scientific legacy. According to EDO, that ad resulted in one-and-a-half times as much engagement, compared with the median Super Bowl ad between 2020 and 2024. EDO measures engagement by analyzing metrics such as online search activity and website visits after the ad aired. “Because we’re focusing on live linear TV, we know exactly when an ad aired. — — like the actual second when it aired,” Grover explained. “And then we’re tying that to search data that is also down-to-the-second level.” For this year’s Super Bowl, at least two drug companies have already announced plans for commercials during the game. The millennial-targeting telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS+5.10%) is set to air its first-ever Super Bowl commercial advertising its lower-cost weight-loss treatments — including an off-brand version of Wegovy. Novartis (NVS+0.67%) is also airing its first Super Bowl ad. Their ad features actress Hailee Steinfeld and aims to raise awareness for breast cancer and the importance of cancer screenings. “If you have the right drug that has a broader appeal, these live events, NFL, and Super Bowl could be really strong environments for a pharma brand,” said Grover.

Instead of a Nigerian Prince, The Big Guy could have put Hunter in charge of our treasury payments. DOGE: David Lebryk controlled the computerized payment system responsible for $6 trillion in Treasury payments before he refused to give Trump's DOGE team access to the system. His manager was a Nigerian immigrant appointed by Biden. He quit two weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/rt8FnbM8zm— @amuse (@amuse) February 1, 2025 I just skimmed the excerpt so maybe I’ve got this wrong ... 0bama was running a Nigerian money scam out of the U.S. Treasury? Probably enriched himself while he was at it. Lest anyone forget, Jussie Smollett was a friend of the 0bama’s who hired two Nigerians to help him fake a “hate crime.” Not that there is any connection to the story here. Wow. We’ll likely start see people who were involved in this treasonous Obama / Biden US Treasury Debt. scam start committing arkancide or go missing. Biden appointee----a Nigerian---- handled US treasury payments. In 2023, the United States provided $1 billion in foreign aid to Nigeria. The US has provided foreign aid to Nigeria for many years, including: 2024: $783 million in foreign aid 2022: $974 million in foreign aid 2021: $922 million in foreign aid 2020: $880 million in foreign aid 2019: $761 million in foreign aid 2018: $877 million in foreign aid 2017: $643 million in foreign aid 2016: $543 million in foreign aid 2015: $446 million in foreign aid The US provides foreign aid to Nigeria to: Support humanitarian efforts Strengthen democratic institutions Promote good governance Counter corruption Improve security Address the factors that drive conflict Provide life-saving assistance to those affected by terrorism Support conventional weapons destruction and humanitarian mine action programs You can learn more about US foreign assistance programs at ForeignAssistance.gov. Why would American get involved in corruption in Nigeria? Must be too many letters form Nigerian princes. If it leads to anything, I don’t think it’s going to be good news. It’s going to make us feel sick how much we’ve been ripped off. Giving the keys to the treasury to thieves. Mercy sakes. This is the Bee. Right?

Title: After DEI, the next frontier is ESG

DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated. DEI is on its way out, but there is a fetid, hidden cavern where it still thrives unmolested: ESG. Among other things, ESG is a system that assesses and regulates a company's "sustainability", ethics and practices. The Environmental aspect of a company rates and evaluates their levels of pollution, energy and water usage, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions to discern the alleged impact on the environment. This assumes, of course, a deleterious effect on the environment, which cannot be proved. The planet has a way of cleaning itself up. It is within the Social aspect of ESG where the DEI may still hide. That area addresses the relationships between its employees and executives with DEI at the core. The Social aspects also include employee health and safety, customer satisfaction, and (take note) "community engagement", the latter being another way to inject DEI. You can hide an awful lot of DEI in "customer satisfaction" and "community engagement." The Governance aspect of ESG is yet another hiding place for DEI: It monitors and rates an organization's leadership and pay, inner workings, and how shareholders are treated and managed. DEI can invade the "leadership" aspect as well. Why ESG at all? Some investors want to know if a company is responsibly "green" and if they are good stewards and managers of the company. And some investors know that the greener and more woke a company is, the less bang for their buck they will get for that investment. Woke is not dead yet and ESG is a good cave for DEI to hide in until Trump blows over – or so they think. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom knows how harmful ESG is. Here is what they think: Activists are using ESG policies as a cudgel to try to force companies to bend to the will of their political causes. As Heritage Action explains, ESG is being used to “punish” American energy and advance a “‘woke’ cultural agenda … from the boardroom down to the factory floor. This agenda is being pushed by green activists, woke culture warriors, global elites, and the big businesses they control. Over the past two decades, companies all over the world have started abiding by the demands imposed on them by ESG. In fact, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have adopted practices or changed their business policies due to ESG, as well as about 70 percent of Russell 1000 companies. But now Americans are waking up to the danger ESG policies pose. A growing number of individuals, groups, and companies are paving an alternative path forward for business. Shoving progressive DEI, ESG, and other woke policies down American throats is nothing new to the hard Left. Take a moment to view this one-minute video titled "ESG hurts" by Heritage Action For America. It's an eye opener, from the "ESG hurts" website: If a company decides not to adopt ESG policies, it risks being de-platformed. So what does adopting ESG policies actually look like? First, if a company wants to boost its environmental score, it needs to go green. Facing pressure from investors, banks, and shareholders, companies are rushing to appear as if they’re doing their part to save the planet. This includes creating policies that appear to address climate change—prioritizing wind and solar energy, limiting waste and water usage, and combating pollution. Second, in order to appear more socially conscious—the “S” in ESG—companies are coerced into educating their employees on critical race theory, supporting radical gender ideology, and adopting pro-abortion policies. The hope is that if a company can prove that it emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, or that it provides travel coverage for employees to access abortions out of state, it will appear more valuable to investors, and hopefully major banking institutions will grant them bigger loans. How a company is ESG-rated on their DEI program, for example, can determine monetary compensation of top executives. If a company shows a high Social (DEI) rating, more wokesters, minorities, and gays can be represented in the highest positions of the company even though they may not be qualified. Vivek Ramaswamy, author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam and the founder of Strive, said about ESG: “BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are using the capital of their clients—everyday Americans—to advocate for policies most of them probably don’t agree with.” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, the home state of retail giant Walmart, has a few choice words about ESG: Climate Action 100+ is an elite group of the most powerful ESG investors in America, including competitors BlackRock and JP Morgan. This cartel of competing investment firms actively targets less powerful companies and coerces them into lowering their carbon footprint... This may constitute what is called a “spoke and hub conspiracy.”… ESG is simply bad for working Americans. Underperforming ESG-compliant companies and under-invested fossil fuel companies alike are forced to lay off workers or scale back planned hiring because of ESG. Similarly, companies are forced to slow or freeze wage increases, hurting employed workers. Climate Action 100+ has as part of its policy to "… seek to ensure equality, diversity and inclusion are reflected in the composition of the Steering Committee." ESG is a major DEI hiding place. We Americans hate DEI so much that Donald Trump made it a focus for elimination. He should do the same with ESG. There is no place in a capitalist economy for climate craziness, racist DEI policies, or interference by culture into business, unless the business invites it – at their own risk. The business of business should be business. Period. Image: Pexels // CCO public domain DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated.

Title: Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST): Among the Best Alcohol Stocks to Buy According to Analysts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Alcohol Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stands against the other alcohol stocks. An analysis by Goldman Sachs has revealed that beer and spirits volumes in the American market have shown little correlation with economic growth. This is because beer and spirits are often seen as affordable luxuries or even staples. Liquor tends to enjoy stable sales even when general consumer spending takes a hit elsewhere, while there have also been times when alcohol sales even increase during economic downturns, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Great Recession of 2008-09. READ ALSO: 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers However, things haven’t been exactly easy for the alcohol sector lately, especially after the recent report from the U.S. Surgeon General claimed that alcohol consumption in the country is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 deaths annually. The report has proposed to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages, signaling a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector if adopted. The proposition, if enacted, could seriously hurt sales for a sector that is already struggling with a pullback in drinking by younger consumers. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, America’s per capita annual consumption of alcohol in 2022 was 2.5 gallons, down from 3.28 gallons in the early 1980s. The growing popularity of low-and no-alcohol products, rising prevalence of cannabis use, and anti-obesity drugs picking up steam certainly haven’t helped either. Another looming threat for the American liquor industry is that of tariffs. The European Union is due to reimpose its retaliatory tariff on American whiskey in late March, but at a higher rate of 50%. Over the last two years, American whiskey exports to the EU have surged by more than 60%, and total US spirits exports grew to a record high of $2.2 billion in 2023. But this success story could face a devastating turn unless President Trump's administration can swiftly negotiate a prolonged suspension or permanent removal of the tariff. However, amidst the sharp decline in sales following the pandemic, one category that could be a bright spot for the struggling booze industry is that of spirit-based RTD’s, despite the fall in the overall spirits segment. Americans consumed over 62 million cases of ready-to-drink spirits in 2023, up almost 25% from 2022, making it the second-largest spirit category by volume, right behind vodka. A plethora of new brands have popped up in the market over the last few years, offering canned versions of many bar classics, including Negroni, Daiquiri, and even the good ol’ Jack & Coke. The alcohol sector also seems to be responding adequately to the evolving consumer trends by investing heavily in a wide range of low- and no-alcohol beverages. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. Sales of Guinness 0.0, the zero-alcohol version of the highly beloved Irish stout, surged by nearly 50% between February 2023 and February 2024, putting it among the Best Selling Non Alcoholic Beers in the US. Nearly every major industry player has come up with No-Lo versions of their highly acclaimed brands, making sure they don’t miss out on their share of a market that is becoming more and more established every day. To collect data for this article, we examined all the companies in the alcohol sector that are listed on NASDAQ and NYSE and then compiled a list of the stocks with the highest upside potential according to Wall Street analysts, as of January 27, 2024. Following are the Best Alcohol Stocks According to Analysts. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A shelf filled with a variety of bottles of energy drinks, juices, and sodas in a convenience store. Stock Upside Potential: 18.43% Next on our list of the Best Alcohol Stocks is one of the biggest names in the global energy drinks market, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), known for brands like Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn. The beverage giant also forayed into the alcohol sector in 2022 when it acquired the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in a deal worth $330 million. The acquisition gave Monster ownership of CANarchy’s craft breweries, which now operate under the name Monster Brewing Co. Shares of MNST have gained over 46% over the last 5 years, with analysts predicting further gains in the future. A notable aspect of Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is its strategic partnership with Coca-Cola, which has owned an approximate 16.7% stake in the energy drinks company since 2015. This gives Monster access to Coca-Cola's vast global distribution network and provides it a competitive edge in international markets. Monster Energy Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has recently been facing challenges in the domestic market, as the energy drinks market in the US continues to struggle. In Q3 of 2024, the company management also pointed to ‘excess inventory levels’ of its Alcohol Brands segment, suggesting slower sales of those products than expected. However, despite these challenges, Monster has managed to outperform its competitors and improve its market share in the US market both in volume and dollar terms, indicating that the company’s brand strength and aggressive marketing strategies are effective in maintaining its competitive edge. Monster Energy Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s globalization strategy also seems to be paying off as international sales now account for approximately 40% of its total revenue, reducing the company’s reliance on the tough domestic market. The international emerging markets are particularly attractive for Monster. As disposable incomes rise in these regions and Western consumer trends gain popularity, the demand for energy drinks is likely to go up. However, such aggressive geographical diversification carries its own risks and the energy drinks giant took a significant revenue hit from the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina in Q3 2024. Overall MNST ranks 7th on our list of the best alcohol stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for MNST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MNST but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

February 01, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action on behalf of purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information.

You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Defensive Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

For this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. Apple has a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the latest quarter, the company returned $30 billion to shareholders. The current annual dividend stands at $0.92 per share, yielding approximately 0.39%. Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) substantial cash reserves, totaling $68 billion as of June 2024, support its capacity to maintain and potentially increase these returns. Apple’s diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty contribute to its resilience during economic downturns. The significant growth in its services segment, which boasts higher margins, enhances revenue stability. Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best defensive stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Most Promising Dividend Stock According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-inc-avgo-most-promising-201236579.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other dividend stocks. During a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it's crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends. Dividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don’t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth. Also read: 8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in According to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan’s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future. The main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment. Since then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters. Investors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it's not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends. Our Methodology: To compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American multinational semiconductor company that offers a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. In its Q4 2024, the company reported revenue of $14.05 billion, which showed a significant 51% growth from the same period last year. Semiconductor revenue reached an all-time high of $30.1 billion, with AI revenue soaring by 220% compared to the previous year, totaling $12.2 billion. This exceptional growth was driven by the company’s cutting-edge AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. For fiscal year 2024, adjusted EBITDA increased by 37% year-over-year, hitting a record $31.9 billion. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is drawing considerable attention from investors thanks to its pivotal role in powering products in various sectors, including data centers and smartphones. Its technology supports more than 99% of internet traffic, underscoring its leadership in networking. Furthermore, the company’s acquisition of VMware, a cloud virtualization firm, a year ago has bolstered its market position. VMware's operating margin has now reached 70%, and the company is on pace to surpass its goal of generating over $8.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA within three years. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) leveraged its robust cash reserves to boost its dividend. In the most recent quarter, the company generated $5.6 billion in operating cash flow and $5.48 billion in free cash flow, accounting for 39% of its total revenue. With 14 consecutive years of dividend growth, Broadcom is considered one of the most promising dividend stocks. The company's per-share dividend comes in at $0.59 every quarter for a dividend yield of 1.07%, as of January 30. Overall AVGO ranks 1st on our list of the most promising dividend stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: This 13% Dividend Is Getting A Makeover. Time To Buy?

Thoughtful woman at the hair salon looking beautiful with her new look BlackRock is making changes to some of its highest-yielding funds. Today we’re going to zero in on a 13%-yielder that’s at the center of the action: the tech-focused BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ). Yes, the fund focused on tech. So the pullback in American AI stocks on news that Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, which was launched earlier this month, can rival the latest version of Open AI’s ChatGPT, factors in here, too. BIGZ is a closed-end fund (CEF) with nearly $2 billion in assets under management—enormous for a CEF (The “BIG” is right in the ticker, after all). So any changes to BIGZ are worth watching, especially when, as is the case now, those changes (including a big share-buyback program) are partly a response to activist action, both around the fund’s sponsor, BlackRock, and the CEF industry as a whole. Let’s dive into exactly what’s going on here. The best place to start, actually, is with BlackRock’s other two big tech CEFs, the 8.2%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), another 13% yielder. Unlike BIGZ, these funds aren’t changing, for reasons that should be clear in a bit. These funds’ portfolios overlap, but they’ve recently taken different paths. BSTZ, for its part, has been focusing more on private tech firms, as well as fast-growing public companies. NVIDIA (NVDA), its largest holding, and Astera Labs (ALAB), are examples of the latter. Both are at the heart of AI’s continued growth. Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024. However, as the developments around DeepSeek showed us, there’s still a lot of uncertainty around AI. That’s why BSTZ’s sister fund, BST, bolsters its NVIDIA position with mature tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all top-10 holdings. As a result, BST has been less volatile in the past year, on the basis of the performance of both its underlying portfolio (a.k.a. its net asset value, or NAV), and its market price (both including dividends). (Since CEFs have fixed share counts, there is often a difference between the market price and NAV returns, with the market price often discounted). But BSTZ (in purple below) put up a stronger market price–based total return as investors got aggressive about tech after the 2022 rout. Total Returns This, by the way, is exactly why we hold this duo—to get tech exposure and use BST’s large cap focus to temper our volatility. That’s worked well, with BST and BSTZ delivering us a 24% average return between them in the last year, well above the S&P 500’s 16% return, with a big slice of that in cash, thanks to their 10.5% average yield. So where does BIGZ fit in here? It has some investments in private firms, similar to BSTZ and, to a lesser extent, BST. But the key difference is that BIGZ has major holdings a little outside tech, with military contractor Axon Enterprise (AXON), data-center servicer Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and plumbing/HVAC specialist Comfort Systems USA (FIX) being its biggest positions. As you can see, the focus here is on small firms that are growing fast. This should mean fast returns for BIGZ—but that’s not what we’ve seen. Check its performance based on the latest numbers for its total NAV return (or, again, the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends). BIGZ Lags As you can see, it was much weaker than those of the other two CEFs. This lag was unacceptable, as activists reminded BlackRock, which responded by shaking up BIGZ in several ways. For one, BIGZ will get a new management team and a new mandate tightening its focus on tech. You can read more about those changes here. BlackRock is also bringing in a buyback program under which shareholders can tender shares of BIGZ for 99.5% of the fund’s NAV per share. The company is offering this for half of the total number of shares outstanding, and the stop and start dates haven’t been announced yet. That’s a massive program that should help support BIGZ’s market price. With a 9.1% discount to NAV, investors can buy BIGZ at 90.9 cents on the dollar and sell at 99.5 cents on the dollar, a 9.5% gain separate from BIGZ’s market performance. The risk here is that, if BIGZ’s NAV drops before an investor can redeem their shares, they might end up redeeming them for less. But in that case, they could simply ignore the redemption and keep collecting BIGZ’s 13% dividend—provided the fund’s new management keeps earning enough profits to maintain that payout.

Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024. However, as the developments around DeepSeek showed us, there’s still a lot of uncertainty around AI. That’s why BSTZ’s sister fund, BST, bolsters its NVIDIA position with mature tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all top-10 holdings. As a result, BST has been less volatile in the past year, on the basis of the performance of both its underlying portfolio (a.k.a. its net asset value, or NAV), and its market price (both including dividends). (Since CEFs have fixed share counts, there is often a difference between the market price and NAV returns, with the market price often discounted). But BSTZ (in purple below) put up a stronger market price–based total return as investors got aggressive about tech after the 2022 rout. Total Returns This, by the way, is exactly why we hold this duo—to get tech exposure and use BST’s large cap focus to temper our volatility. That’s worked well, with BST and BSTZ delivering us a 24% average return between them in the last year, well above the S&P 500’s 16% return, with a big slice of that in cash, thanks to their 10.5% average yield. So where does BIGZ fit in here? It has some investments in private firms, similar to BSTZ and, to a lesser extent, BST. But the key difference is that BIGZ has major holdings a little outside tech, with military contractor Axon Enterprise (AXON), data-center servicer Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and plumbing/HVAC specialist Comfort Systems USA (FIX) being its biggest positions. As you can see, the focus here is on small firms that are growing fast. This should mean fast returns for BIGZ—but that’s not what we’ve seen. Check its performance based on the latest numbers for its total NAV return (or, again, the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends). BIGZ Lags As you can see, it was much weaker than those of the other two CEFs. This lag was unacceptable, as activists reminded BlackRock, which responded by shaking up BIGZ in several ways. For one, BIGZ will get a new management team and a new mandate tightening its focus on tech. You can read more about those changes here. BlackRock is also bringing in a buyback program under which shareholders can tender shares of BIGZ for 99.5% of the fund’s NAV per share. The company is offering this for half of the total number of shares outstanding, and the stop and start dates haven’t been announced yet. That’s a massive program that should help support BIGZ’s market price. With a 9.1% discount to NAV, investors can buy BIGZ at 90.9 cents on the dollar and sell at 99.5 cents on the dollar, a 9.5% gain separate from BIGZ’s market performance. The risk here is that, if BIGZ’s NAV drops before an investor can redeem their shares, they might end up redeeming them for less. But in that case, they could simply ignore the redemption and keep collecting BIGZ’s 13% dividend—provided the fund’s new management keeps earning enough profits to maintain that payout.

Title: This 13% Dividend Is Getting A Makeover. Time To Buy?

Thoughtful woman at the hair salon looking beautiful with her new look BlackRock is making changes to some of its highest-yielding funds. Today we’re going to zero in on a 13%-yielder that’s at the center of the action: the tech-focused BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ). Yes, the fund focused on tech. So the pullback in American AI stocks on news that Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, which was launched earlier this month, can rival the latest version of Open AI’s ChatGPT, factors in here, too. BIGZ is a closed-end fund (CEF) with nearly $2 billion in assets under management—enormous for a CEF (The “BIG” is right in the ticker, after all). So any changes to BIGZ are worth watching, especially when, as is the case now, those changes (including a big share-buyback program) are partly a response to activist action, both around the fund’s sponsor, BlackRock, and the CEF industry as a whole. Let’s dive into exactly what’s going on here. The best place to start, actually, is with BlackRock’s other two big tech CEFs, the 8.2%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), another 13% yielder. Unlike BIGZ, these funds aren’t changing, for reasons that should be clear in a bit. These funds’ portfolios overlap, but they’ve recently taken different paths. BSTZ, for its part, has been focusing more on private tech firms, as well as fast-growing public companies. NVIDIA (NVDA), its largest holding, and Astera Labs (ALAB), are examples of the latter. Both are at the heart of AI’s continued growth. Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024.

Title: Apple is no longer working on smart glasses to rival Meta
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apples-upcoming-ar-glasses-might-be-dead-water/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T14:30:57Z
Full Content:
It’s been a rumor for some time now that Apple had a pair of AR glasses in development, but a new report from Mark Gurman says the company has cancelled the project. Apple has expressed a lot of interest in the AR/VR space, but its first attempt with the Vision Pro didn’t make the splash the company expected. Its over-the-top price and more professionally-focused applications led to fewer sales and a lot of excess stock. The goal was to create a competitor to the Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, but Gurman says the cancellation comes in the wake of an attempt to change and improve the design of the glasses. The first version of the glasses would link with an iPhone, but its limited power meant applications were limited — and the demands of the device also had an impact on phone battery life. Apple pivoted and focused on linking the glasses with a Mac instead, but that was met with poor evaluations. The development team reportedly dealt with frequently-changing goals, adding to the difficulty, until the project was cancelled. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time Apple has shuttered a project. The company has entertained the idea of a self-driving car for a decade, but Apple gave that project the axe last year. Gurman says Apple also cancelled work on in-house LED displays for the Apple Watch, too. The loss of these projects doesn’t bode well for the future of the already-struggling Vision Pro. Gurman says Apple has a planned successor to the Vision Pro that would improve on the flaws in its original release, although there are employees who “believe there’s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team.” Apple hasn’t completely given up on AR glasses. Several unnamed executives “still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday,” according to the report. Meta doesn’t plan to release its AR smart glasses until 2027, so Apple still has some time to come up with another approach. It would be a welcome addition to the lineup, and a much more affordable way to access Vision Pro-like features. Posts on X are popping up reporting that Microsoft has signed a development and supply contract with Samsung Display for micro-OLED displays. The information originates from a Korean tech site, The Elec, which claims that Microsoft wants "hundreds of thousands" of these displays for an XR device designed for gaming and media consumption. In other words, a competitor for the Vision Pro -- or rather, another competitor for the Vision Pro. There's no doubt that the Vision Pro hasn't exactly been a bestseller. A new report from market analysts indicates that fewer than 500,000 Vision Pro headsets will be sold by the end of the year. However, the report also offers some good news for the future of the platform. According to Bloomberg, citing data from market analyst IDC, Apple is planning a cheaper version of the Vision Pro in 2025, and that could be the company's ticket to a much more popular device, predicting that it could double the sales of the Vision Pro next year. A few years back, I was invited to meet with Apple about its new push into gaming. The company wouldn’t show me a flashy new product to enable that. Instead, it showed me something more modest: No Man’s Sky running smoothly on a MacBook. It looked great, but it wasn’t exactly earth-shattering. It was an independent game from 2016 running on a laptop as well as it had already been running for years on other PCs. I got the sense that I wasn’t there to cover a big development in tech, but rather to see a proof of concept that had bigger plans attached. Years later, those plans are coming into focus even if they still aren’t fully realized yet. I recently attended a repeat of that showcase, only this time I wasn’t just watching an eight-year-old game running on a laptop. I demoed several games, including brand new ones, this time running on a range of devices including the MacBook Air M3 and a 13” iPad Pro M4. While we’re still a long ways away from the App Store being up to snuff with Steam on Windows, I’m starting to see where gaming on iOS is headed -- and Apple is getting there faster than I expected. Growing gaming During my recent session with Apple, I’d get to see and play several games running across iPhone, iPad, and Macbooks. Some of those experiences are more exciting for Apple than for casual players. It’s neat that Resident Evil 7 can run well on an iPhone, but that’s not so surprising when I already know that the much more recent Resident Evil 4 does too. I’m happy to see games like Control and Valheim looking great, but those are existential wins for Apple as it seeks more partners to expand its gaming efforts. I don’t imagine that gamers are jumping to play games that have been out for years on an Apple device (and according to reports, they very much aren’t yet).

Title: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Leading with AI-Powered Cloud and Tranium Investments

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News and Ratings Investors Should Take a Look At. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news and ratings investors should take a look at. As AI continues to reshape industries, investors are closely watching how companies allocate capital during concerns over high valuations. According to some experts, despite market fluctuations, businesses are unlikely to cut AI investments significantly, as the technology’s long-term impact is still unfolding. The comparison to the dot-com era raises questions about sustainability, but many see AI as an innovation cycle that will drive broader economic growth. Marta Norton, chief investment strategist at Empower, believes companies are unlikely to significantly alter their AI-related spending despite concerns over high valuations, especially as DeepSeek raises questions about supply chains. She discussed this on Bloomberg Technology with Caroline Hyde and Mike Shepard, emphasizing that the market is still in an AI investment race and earnings reports will be key in determining future spending patterns. She noted that recent market reactions have been more about valuation concerns than doubts about AI itself. While Nvidia remains central to AI supply chains, the debate is now shifting to whether businesses need to keep spending at the current pace. Comparing the situation to the dot-com era, Norton acknowledged the risks of high valuations but pointed out that major technological shifts, like AI, can drive long-term economic expansion, similar to how the internet transformed industries. On the potential impact of cheaper AI solutions, she suggested that businesses, including retailers and software firms, could benefit from faster, more efficient deployments. However, she cautioned that these effects may take time to materialize rather than being immediately reflected in quarterly earnings. Addressing concerns about broader market disruption, she acknowledged vulnerabilities in major tech stocks but argued that the fundamental case for AI remains strong, with the primary uncertainty revolving around supply chains rather than AI adoption itself. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) incorporates AI across shopping, entertainment, and operations, fueling innovation through investments, AWS collaborations, and Tranium. On January 30, TipRanks reported that Bank of America’s Justin Post reaffirmed a Buy rating on Amazon with a $255 price target. The firm mentioned strong demand for AWS and its expected 19-20% year-over-year growth in Q4. He highlighted Amazon’s investments in infrastructure, including Trainium chips, as key to sustaining future growth. The company’s practice of billing primarily in USD also helps reduce foreign exchange risks, supporting its overall financial stability. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of AI news and ratings investors should take a look at. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Costco (COST) the Best Defensive Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

A customer in a warehouse aisles, browsing the wide range of branded and private-label products. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. In the fiscal year ending September 1, 2024, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) reported net sales of $249.6 billion, marking a 5% increase from the previous year. Comparable sales growth was strong across all regions, with the US at 5.3%, Canada at 5.5%, and Other International markets at 5.7%. E-commerce sales also saw a significant rise of 18.9% during the fourth quarter. Net income was $2.354 billion, or $5.29 per diluted share, compared to $2.160 billion, or $4.86 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The firm has a history of providing stable and growing dividends to its shareholders. In November 2024, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.16 per share, resulting in an annual dividend of $4.64 per share and a yield of approximately 0.49%. Notably, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) has increased its dividend for 20 consecutive years, with a dividend growth rate of 13.64%. Overall, COST ranks 8th on our list of best defensive stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of COST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 16: SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son delivers remarks alongside U.S. ... [+] President-elect Donald Trump and Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce, Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick (L) at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on December 16, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) "I think over the next, call it 20ish years, probably the entire eurodollar market is moving to stablecoins," predicts Austin Campbell, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and CEO of WSPN USA. It's a bold claim – suggesting that a $210 billion market could absorb a system 50 times its size. Yet the prediction becomes more plausible when you understand how the offshore dollar market evolved, and why stablecoins represent its natural digital successor. The modern financial system runs on a form of dollars that most Americans have never heard of. Eurodollars – dollar deposits held outside the U.S. banking system – represent between $10-13 trillion in value. Born in the 1950s as a way for Soviet banks to hold dollars beyond U.S. reach, they grew into the backbone of international finance. Today, they're how Japanese manufacturers pay for Indonesian raw materials and how European banks fund American mortgages. This massive market emerged not through design but necessity. When Cold War politics made direct dollar holdings risky for Soviet institutions, they began keeping dollar deposits in European banks. These banks realized they could lend these dollars without maintaining the same reserves U.S. banks required, creating a more efficient (if less regulated) dollar funding market. Most Americans have never interacted with a stablecoin or a eurodollar, and many struggle to understand their value as they are well served by their domestic banking system. But Americans aren’t the only users of US dollars. A large percentage of dollars serve users outside America. Of the $2.3 trillion in physical U.S. banknotes, the Federal Reserve estimates that 40-75% circulate abroad. Traditional bank deposits show a similar pattern – the $18 trillion in U.S. domestic deposits is comparable to the size of the $10-13 trillion Eurodollar market. These numbers reveal a crucial reality: trillions of dollars already sit outside the U.S. banking system, held by individuals and businesses who need dollars but lack access to American banks. Stablecoins aren't creating this demand for offshore dollars – they're simply providing a more efficient solution for it. Originally stablecoins emerged as digital casino chips for crypto speculators. Just as a casino allows you to exchange dollars for chips that can be used throughout their property, stablecoins let you convert traditional dollars into digital tokens usable across the entire internet. And just like casino chips, their value is backed by real dollars held in reserve – at least in theory. The story of stablecoins can't be told without mentioning Tether (USDT), which remains the largest stablecoin with a market cap of over $100 billion. Founded in 2014 to solve crypto traders' need for a stable trading instrument, Tether's history reads like a thriller. Early controversies about its reserves – which once included commercial paper and mysterious "other investments" – gave way to increased transparency following regulatory scrutiny. Today, Tether primarily backs its tokens with U.S. Treasuries, managed by Cantor Fitzgerald under CEO Howard Lutnick (pictured above) – who is set to serve as Secretary of Commerce. This institutional evolution mirrors the broader transformation of the stablecoin industry from crypto frontier to mainstream finance. Newer entrants like Circle's USDC have taken a more regulated approach from the start. Circle's partnership with BlackRock for reserve management signals the institutionalization of the sector. Yet it is still early days for stablecoins. As analyst Simon Taylor explains, "We're in the dial-up era of Stablecoins, so they're still janky, and connecting is slow and painful. In time, Stablecoins will create an abstraction layer above existing payment rails, just as the Internet did over the telcos." Nevertheless, Taylor's analysis reveals why stablecoins aren't just cheaper – they're fundamentally better infrastructure. Traditional international payments involve a complex web of correspondent banks, SWIFT messages, multiple compliance checks, and days of settlement time. The genius of stablecoins lies in collapsing this complexity into a single layer. A stablecoin transfer is more akin to handing someone cash than initiating a bank wire – but it can happen instantly across borders. Recent research from Castle Island Ventures and Visa reveals the scale of adoption already underway. Stablecoin transaction volumes were estimated at $450 billion per month—roughly half of the just over $1 trillion that Visa processes monthly. Adoption is growing fastest in emerging markets. The study found that 47% of users in developing economies primarily use stablecoins for dollar savings, while 43% cite currency conversion as their main goal. This adoption isn't merely speculative. In Nigeria, where foreign exchange shortages are chronic, stablecoins have become crucial for international trade. As Yellow Card, Africa's largest stablecoin platform notes, "70% of African countries have a FX shortage that has been declared a crisis." The latest evolution comes from yield-bearing variants such as Mountain Protocol. Just as Eurodollar deposits typically offered higher interest rates than domestic U.S. deposits, new stablecoins are finding ways to pass along the yields from their Treasury holdings to users. This development suggests how stablecoins might eventually compete with traditional bank deposits. In his inauguration speech, Donald Trump argued for the creation of an “External Revenue Service” to collect revenue from other countries. Given that stablecoin advocate Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick will be involved in its creation, perhaps the president already had the shift from Eurodollars to stablecoins in mind. The transition from Eurodollars to stablecoins could mark a significant shift in America's global financial power. Eurodollars emerged during the Cold War, when U.S. policymakers saw value in allowing European banks to create dollar liquidity beyond American shores. Today's geopolitical reality is markedly different. In an era of great power competition and economic warfare, the diffuse Eurodollar system may have outlived its strategic utility. Stablecoins offer Washington a chance to recentralize control over offshore dollars. When foreign banks create Eurodollars, they share in the profits of dollar dominance. In contrast, major stablecoin issuers back their tokens primarily with U.S. Treasuries, directly funding American government debt. This shift would align with the more zero-sum view of international relations championed by figures like President Trump, concentrating the benefits of dollar dominance within U.S. borders. The winners in this transition would be concentrated in America: the U.S. Treasury would see increased demand for its debt, while U.S.-based stablecoin issuers would become the new gatekeepers of global dollar liquidity. Users in emerging markets would gain better access to dollars, potentially accelerating global dollarization. The losers would be equally clear: non-U.S. banks would see their Eurodollar business evaporate, while weak local currencies would face even steeper competition from digital dollars. Traditional payment intermediaries would find their business models undermined by more efficient stablecoin rails. Can stablecoins really absorb the $10 trillion Eurodollar market? The better question might be: why wouldn't they? They offer the same basic service – dollar exposure outside traditional U.S. banking – with added benefits of programmability, transparency, and efficiency. The transition won't happen overnight, but as Campbell suggests, the direction seems clear. Just as Eurodollars emerged to meet the 20th century's need for efficient dollar funding, stablecoins are evolving to serve the digital economy's demand for programmable, borderless dollars. The real question isn't whether digital dollars will become ubiquitous, but whether the U.S. will embrace and shape this transition to maintain its financial advantages in the digital age.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 01 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions.

Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 01 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies.

Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 01 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been.

And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us.

Title: NatWest finalises £450m bonus pot as return to private ownership looms

The bank's annual results will come with the government on the brink of no longer being its single-biggest shareholder after nearly 17 years, Sky News can reveal. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 1 February 2025 11:40, UK NatWest Group is finalising plans to pay out close to £450m in bonuses for last year as it prepares for a return to full private ownership nearly 17 years after its bailout. Sky News has learnt that the bank's remuneration committee is close to signing off the bonus pool ahead of its annual results announcement later this month. The figure of roughly £450m will be about 25% higher than last year's bonus pot of £356m, reflecting NatWest's sharply improved performance in 2024, according to City sources. Shares in the bank, which at one point was more than 80%-owned by British taxpayers, have nearly doubled over the last 12 months. The Treasury has been rapidly reducing its stake in NatWest, with it now standing at just under 8%. This weekend, Sky News can also reveal that the state will cease to become the company's single-biggest shareholder within a matter of weeks, based on the current pace of the government's trading plan, which drip-feeds stock into the market. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, holds a stake in NatWest of roughly 6%, meaning it could replace the Treasury as NatWest's biggest investor as early as this month. Markets react to Trump's tariffs as he warns UK 'out of line' on trade with US Trump tariffs: How the UK finds itself in a strong position on US trade Donald Trump's tariffs: What's going on and what does it all mean? That would represent another significant milestone for NatWest's board, chaired by Rick Haythornthwaite. In October, the bank raised its profit outlook after posting a 26% rise in third-quarter income. After its shares closed at 433.1p on Friday afternoon, it now has a market capitalisation of close to £35bn. Last year, Sky News revealed that NatWest was planning to hand its chief executive a potential multimillion pound pay boost as it returns to full private ownership. Lena Wilson, the chair of the bank's remuneration committee has been consulting leading institutional shareholders about an overhaul of its boardroom pay policy, with the proposals to be put to a vote at its spring AGM. Under the plans, Paul Thwaite, who took over as the bank's interim chief executive in July 2023 before being handed the role on a permanent basis in February, would be in line for an increase in his maximum annual bonus from 100% of his base salary to 150%. NatWest also intends to replace its restricted share plan (RSP) for Mr Thwaite, which awarded him stock worth a maximum of 150% of his salary, with a performance share plan (PSP) which could pay him up to three times his basic pay each year. Assuming his salary of just under £1.2m remains unchanged, that would mean him being in line for a maximum reward package - excluding pension contributions and other items - of about £6.6m, up from roughly £4.2m today. The prospective increase would bring Mr Thwaite's compensation more closely into line with peers including Charlie Nunn at Lloyds Banking Group and CS Venkatakrishnan at Barclays - who himself is expected to see his annual pay capped at just over £14m under a new policy. Mr Thwaite replaced Dame Alison Rose after she was forced to step down over the debanking row involving Nigel Farage, the Reform Party leader.

During its previous incarnation as Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank encountered annual controversy over its remuneration - for its chief executives and the wider workforce. In the immediate aftermath of its £45.5bn rescue by taxpayers during the financial crisis of 2008, the pension package of Fred Goodwin, RBS's former chief, and bonuses awarded to his successor, Stephen Hester, became political headaches for the governments of Gordon Brown and David Cameron. In recent years, however, such conflagrations have been defused by a combination of pay restraint and improved performance.

Title: 5 key investing lessons from recent AI-market mania

Time Published: 2025-02-01T10:00:02Z

A new AI model from China rattled US markets this past week. DeepSeek represented a breakthrough for the AI industry, delivering results on par with OpenAI's best model while using significantly less computing power. The implications have been substantial. Nvidia stock shed nearly $600 billion in market value in a single day as investors worried about future demand for its GPU chips, which are the main fuel source for large language models. Suppose large language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta adopt some of the techniques utilized by the open-sourced DeepSeek and become more efficient. Will they need as much computing power as initially thought? On the flip side, AI adopters, particularly software companies, surged on the prospect that the cost of AI technologies would decrease significantly, leading to higher profit margins. But there are even broader lessons investors can take from this week's black swan event, and they impact everything from bonds to stocks and even crypto. The concentration of a handful of mega-cap tech companies dominating the stock market has crept up to historic levels over the past few years. According to Goldman Sachs data, the top five stocks in the S&P 500 made up about 29% of the index as of December 31, and they're all highly exposed to similar technology trends. "Concentration in several large names is a concern when the drivers of success are the same for most of the names," Chris Fasciano, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network, told Business Insider. Concentration is a double-edged sword. It can work great in bull markets, but a simple disruption to investors' overarching narrative could lead to a painful decline, as seen on Monday, when the index tracking mega-cap tech stocks plunged 3%, compared to a slight gain for the equal-weighted S&P 500. The concentration speaks to the idea that investors may not be as diversified as they believe. "This is an underappreciated consideration," Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told BI. "It is common — and understandable — for investors to believe that they are adequately diversified when they buy an S&P 500-linked fund," Sosnick said, but that's not the case based on the extreme concentration levels. "Those seeking true diversification need to look beyond SPX," Sosnick said, adding that the Nasdaq is not the answer, with a handful of stocks making up about half of that index. Nvidia has dominated the AI story since ChatGPT was released in November 2022, as it turned into the key "picks and shovels" supplier to companies developing their own large language models. But Monday's price action revealed that there are second-derivative beneficiaries to the AI trade, which includes the adopters of AI technologies like software companies. If DeepSeek's claims of using less computing power are accurate, that means costs should come down considerably for AI adopters, pushing profit margins higher. Among the software winners amid Monday's bloodbath was Salesforce, which gained as much as 10% while the market swooned. "If DeepSeek has truly shown us that an open-source solution is far less resource-dependent than the ChatGPT paradigm, then the benefits of AI might be easier to reap from companies unwilling or unable to afford to partner up with one of the current firms that currently dominate the arena," Sosnick said. Crypto volatility was on full display this week, even though DeepSeek's appeared to mainly impact tech firms. Bitcoin dropped as much as 7%, in tandem with the sharp decline with the Nasdaq 100. The sell-off highlights that cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to moves in the broader tech space, and absent any crypto-specific catalysts, bitcoin is a high-octane bet on tech's continued outperformance of "Safe havens don't have an average daily volatility of 2%," Sosnick said. "Over the past 6 months, the correlation of the price levels of bitcoin and NDX is about 80%." Apple stock bucked the DeepSeek sell-off, rising about 8% in the week as investors determined that the company's decision not to spend tens of billions of dollars on building its own large language model was a good one. Instead, Apple is focused on leveraging ChatGPT's AI model and using edge computing to deliver quick answers to iPhone users. That edge computing is key, as it could become even more ubiquitous if AI models see a decline in their compute consumption thanks to the breakthroughs identified by DeepSeek. And a decline in compute consumption ultimately means a decline in costs, which could fuel even more stock buybacks and dividends for the company. "Cheap AI means a lot more capital to return to shareholders, either in the form of dividends or stock buybacks. Every US Big Tech company except Amazon already has both in place. Now they can get much, much bigger," Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in a note this week. If DeepSeek's open-source model delivers the expected cost savings to other large language models, it could ultimately mean higher efficiency and lower costs. According to tech CEOs, like Microsoft's Satya Nadella, cheap AI models should further accelerate the adoption of AI across various industries and lead to a surge in productivity. If that happens, economic growth could continue without sparking a rebound in inflation, which would put interest rates back on a downward trend. "If DeepSeek's processes show that the AI revolution can be achieved at a lower cost and with lower energy usage, that would be good for macro conditions (such as productivity and inflation) going forward," LPL chief strategist Jeff Buchbinder wrote this week. "In theory, this would help reduce the Fed's neutral rate a touch and keep interest rates lower than they otherwise would be if big AI spending continued unabated." Lower interest rates mean higher bond prices, sparking a potential rally in an asset class that was hurt by the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023. "More egalitarian AI can and should boost productivity throughout the economy and thus have benefits for price levels and interest rates," Sosnick said, though he cautioned that such an outcome is "not going to happen immediately."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other beginner-friendly stocks. Uncertainty sweeps across the US with the incoming administration’s potential policies. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump's trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows: "Everything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets" Recently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s, or Meta’s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build. The event raised a lot of concerns over America’s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers, as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China’s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek’s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple’s App Store demonstrates the country’s rapid gains in the sector. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading e-commerce company that has grown in a variety of businesses such as its core e-commerce operations, cloud services, as well as digital advertising. Additionally, Amazon manufactures and sells electronic devices such as Kindle, Ring, Blink, Fire tablet, Fire TV, and Echo. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) serves as a global leader in e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming. The company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its most recent quarter, with Amazon’s cloud and advertising units showing strong growth. Ahead of the new earnings for Q4 2024 which are to be released on February 6, several Wall Street firms agree the e-commerce and cloud giant boasts the strongest setup among the mega-cap tech companies going into the earnings season, as reported by CNBC. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill maintained a Buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $275. On January 24, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also got a Buy rating from Scotiabank’s Nat Schindler. Lisa Schreiber from Gradient Investments emphasized Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) being one of her top picks for 2025 as follows: “It’s the leader in online retail and is very well-diversified with its cloud-based business, where it’s also a leader. Additionally, its ad business is gaining momentum and doing very well. Together with the fact that the path to AI monetization seems clearer for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) compared to other big names, we just have to recall their latest commentary around their cloud business, where they plan to introduce their own AI chip, which could potentially rival Nvidia down the road. The introduction of their AI agents is also increasing efficiency in their online retail. I think all of that presents great opportunities for 2025.” Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other long term low risk stocks. As the DeepSeek craze ignites a sell-off in the tech sector, investors are weighing the implications of the downturn in the long term. This is because the technology sector, particularly the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, has been a significant driver of market gains in the past few years. However, Bank of America strategists caution that these tech giants may face challenges ahead, dubbing them the "Lagnificent 7" due to potential underperformance. Factors such as diminishing US exceptionalism, vast fiscal spending, high immigration, and the AI investment bubble are cited as contributing to this anticipated slowdown. The bank has advised investors to explore undervalued opportunities in sectors like Japanese and European banks, commodities, high-yield bonds, international stocks, and cyclical sectors, given expected rebounds in global manufacturing activity. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. There are also several long term and low risk equities trading on the US stock market that could provide investors with the hedge they need against volatile tech stocks. According to a report by news agency Reuters, looking ahead, investors are cautiously optimistic about 2025, anticipating gains fueled by a solid economy, moderating interest rates, and pro-growth policies from the incoming administration. The S&P 500 has experienced significant growth over the past two years, and corporate profits are projected to rise by over 10% in 2025. However, risks such as persistent inflation, potential policy shifts, and elevated stock valuations warrant careful consideration. Strategies may include diversifying portfolios, focusing on undervalued sectors, and closely monitoring economic indicators to navigate the evolving landscape.

Title: Mixture-Of-Experts AI Reasoning Models Suddenly Taking Center Stage Due To China’s DeepSeek Shock-And-Awe
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2025/02/01/mixture-of-experts-ai-reasoning-models-suddenly-taking-center-stage-due-to-chinas-deepseek-shock-and-awe/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T08:15:00Z
Full Content:
Mixture-of-experts LLM structure becomes super-hot as a result of the DeepSeek AI release. In today’s column, I examine the sudden and dramatic surge of interest in a form of AI reasoning model known as a mixture-of-experts (MoE). This useful generative AI and large language model (LLM) approach has been around for quite a while and its formulation is relatively well-known. I will lay out for you the particulars so that you’ll have a solid notion of what mixture-of-experts is all about. The reason MoE suddenly garnered its moment in the spotlight is due to the release of DeepSeek’s model R1 which uses MoE extensively. In case you haven’t been plugged into the latest AI revelations, DeepSeek is a China-based AI company that has made available a ChatGPT-like LLM. They also made a bold claim that the AI was devised at a significantly reduced cost, causing quite a pronounced stir since the bulk of USA AI efforts assume that only vast and costly amounts of hardware could produce such a capable model. Hardware provider Nvidia took a big hit in their stock price and most of the major USA AI firms also saw their stocks get punished. If you are interested in whether we need to keep scaling up or whether maybe we need to work smarter when it comes to advancing AI, see my in-depth analysis at the link here. I will focus my discussion here on the overall nature of the mixture-of-experts approach, including how it has both key advantages and disadvantages. That being said, please know that the DeepSeek AI system is said to have also leaned heavily into the use of knowledge distillation, which I’ve covered extensively at the link here. The idea is that you can rapidly bring a new AI system up to speed by using an existing fully capable one to transfer or train the newbie lesser model. Some assert that if DeepSeek took that route, in a sense they were “cheating” in that they relied on someone else’s existing model to parlay their instance into existence (see my discussion about the ethical and legal intellectual property or IP rights issues that arise, at the link here). Another factor of their AI approach is that they extensively utilized reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, which I’ve covered at the link here. The star of this show is mixture-of-experts or MoE. Let’s talk about it. This analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here). The mixture-of-experts approach traces its roots back to the early 1990s and I will toward the end of this discussion share with you some fascinating quotes from a now-classic AI research paper that got the ball rolling on this innovation in 1991. By and large, the core facets are still true today. The core is what I’m going to introduce to you. To get things underway, I am going to provide a simplified version of MoE. I say this to try and avoid getting harangued by trolls who will be distraught that I won’t be portraying the mathematical and computational complexities. Those nitty-gritty details are certainly valuable, and indeed, I will provide references throughout where you can readily learn more on the matter. Here’s the deal. The most common way to devise generative AI consists of designing the internal structure or architecture as one large monolith. Any prompt that a user enters will essentially be routed throughout this massive byzantine structure and have zillions of touchpoints as it progresses and is processed. This is easy to devise, somewhat easier to maintain, and generally works pretty well. An alternative approach is to decide that we will divide up the monolith into respective parts or components. Each component will have a specific purpose. The AI parlance is to say that these components are “experts” and that we are dividing up the processing into occurring across a multitude of these experts. I personally disfavor the use of the word “expert” to refer to the components since this tends to anthropomorphize the AI, as though it is a set of human experts. Each component is merely devoted to some area of interest, and I would say are specialized in what they can suitably process. Anyway, the word “expert” is catchy and has become the default terminology in use. The bottom line is that the mixture-of-experts approach consists of deciding beforehand that when you create a generative AI or LLM you will divide it up into some number of components that we’ll say are experts. Doing so has some exciting properties that can boost the AI in comparison to the run-of-the-mill monolithic route. Handiness Of A Bundle Of Experts The good news about mixture-of-experts is that you can hone the AI to be adept in specific areas or domains. For example, suppose I wanted to ask generative AI some questions about various U.S. presidents, in particular, let’s say Abraham Lincoln. A monolithic AI structure would take my prompt and feed my question about Honest Abe to the entire landscape of the AI system being utilized. Here and there, various bits and pieces about Lincoln might be touched upon. Eventually, it is hopefully brought together by the AI and presented to me as a cohesive answer to my question about Lincoln. In the case of MoE, we might have set up the LLM on the basis of “experts” that are components devoted to specific presidents. There is a component about Lincoln. A different component concentrates on George Washington. And so on. My prompt asking about Abraham Lincoln would get routed to the Honest Abe component. This component derives a response to my prompt. The response is then presented to me. Voila, easy-peasy. Note that a crucial element of the MoE is that the prompt by the user must be carefully parsed by the AI to suitably identify which expert ought to be activated. Suppose that I asked about Abraham Lincoln, but the AI sent my prompt to the component on George Washington. Sad face. Not where my prompt should have gone. Now then, in theory, the George Washington component would detect that the prompt is about Lincoln and then pass the request either back to the routing function or directly to the Lincoln component. You might say that the gateway or gating of the mixture-of-experts is a make-or-break activity. When a prompt comes in, the gateway had better do a decent job of figuring out which expert should get the request. If the wrong expert is selected, this could be a waste of time and effort. Worse, the wrong expert might try to generate an answer. Imagine my surprise if the AI responded with details about George Washington rather than Honest Abe. The gating has to be reliable; it has to be quick since otherwise time is unduly consumed, and it is also a kind of bottleneck. The positive aspect is that your prompt is likely to end up at the right place in the fastest time in comparison to the meandering monolith approach. The negative aspect is that your prompt might get misrouted and ultimately even produce a wrong or inappropriate response. Just another tradeoff in the harsh world we live in. Seems like you can never truly eat your cake and have the icing too. To showcase how this works, let’s assume that you are using generative AI to help diagnose what is wrong with your car. Your car has been making some oddball noises lately. There doesn’t seem to be any obvious basis for the noise. You log into a generative AI app that is made via a monolith-oriented architecture. The AI has various automotive mechanic capabilities spread around in the overall structure but there aren’t specific components devoted to say the engine, the transmission, etc. Here we go. As you can see, the AI is spreading your request across the landscape of the AI and merely generically seeking car mechanic portions. You decide to log out of the AI and instead log into a mixture-of-experts or MoE-based model. Here’s what happens. You can now see that the AI first used a gateway function that was labeled as a car diagnostician. This overall component decided that the specialized component or “expert” on engines would be the best place to route the request to. Sure enough, the engine expert said that the problem is with the engine. Let’s use the same example and this time the engine expert says that the engine isn’t the culprit making the oddball noise. You can see that the engine expert reported back to the gateway. The gateway then opted to make another guess and routed the request to the transmission expert. Luckily, this was the right final place to land in. Depending upon how the MoE is shaped, sometimes you won’t realize that the various so-called experts within the AI are being consulted. There isn’t necessarily a need for you to know what took place during the processing of your prompt. All you probably care about is that you get a solid answer to your prompt. Thus, another purpose of the gateway is often that it routes internally, collects what is being generated by the internal structure, and aggregates it into the final response that you ultimately see. Everything else is hidden from your view. Here’s what that might be like. In this instance, the gateway carried on an internal conversation with the various AI experts. Once a resolution was devised, the gateway aggregated the results and was ready to present the recommendation to the user. For an AI maker or developer, a big challenge when leaning into a mixture-of-experts approach is what the various experts or components will be focused on. You usually must decide this upfront. Once you’ve made that decision, the structure is somewhat locked into place. Suppose I opted to go with components focused on USA presidents. A user comes along and wants to ask about USA governors. Oops, my LLM wasn’t structured on that basis. At that juncture, it could be that I have set up only some experts and allowed a semi-monolith for the rest of the structure, and I will then route the prompt to that monolith portion. You could argue that this is not too bad since that’s what would have happened in a pure monolith structure, on the other hand, the experts aren’t being of much advantage if that happens quite a lot. Another notable design question is how many experts to have. Should I have experts per president, and then experts per vice president, or maybe just have experts that each cover a pair of a president and their associated vice president? This is a tough aspect to decide at the get-go. Generative AI is data trained by scanning the Internet and pattern-matching on human writing. The good news about MoE is that you can direct the scans toward the areas that pertain to the experts or components that you’ve decided upon. This can expedite data training. A downside is that you need to figure out whether the components or experts are getting sufficient data training. When you do things for a monolith, you at times just let the data training go as long as you can afford to do so or run out of data for training purposes. The MoE is usually best undertaken by assessing how deep and sufficient the components are during the initial data training. The upshot is that data training requires a different semblance of perspective depending upon whether you are data training an underlying monolith LLM or a MoE model. Lots more twists and turns come into the picture. Some advocate that MoE should have shared experts along with dedicated experts. This involves deciding that there will be specialized components that any of the other experts can use versus ones that are only to be used by say the gateway. The beauty of having multiple experts or components is that you can potentially leverage parallelization during the processing of a prompt. Envision that I wrote a prompt asking about both Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. In a conventional monolith, this is clunkily floated around to figure out which bits and bytes have something relevant to generate. With MoE, the gateway could split the prompt into two pieces, routing one piece to the Lincoln expert and the other piece to the George Washington expert, having both components working simultaneously on my prompt. Nice. Speed can be a great outcome of using MoE. A troubling aspect though can at times arise. The gateway might start to overuse some of the experts. Those particular experts become excessively relied upon. The AI gets sluggish. An important ongoing chore might be to monitor the spread of the usage and have some form of balancing algorithm to try and get things evened out if feasible. If you are intrigued by the MoE approach, you might enjoy the now-classic AI research paper that many attribute to having gotten this line of architecture underway (please know that prior papers also postulated and examined the topic). The paper is entitled “Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts” by Robert A. Jacobs, Michael I. Jordan, Steven J. Nowlan, and Geoffrey E. Hinton, Neural Computation, 1991, and made these salient points (excerpts): The emphasis is that generative AI and LLMs typically make use of artificial neural networks (ANN) as the underpinning of the AI, see my explanation about such neural networks at the link here. You can create a humongous artificial neural network as one massive monolith or divide it into subnetworks. Those subnetworks are the components or experts of the MoE structure. As mentioned earlier, doing so can make processing faster, which in AI parlance you say that the “inferencing” is sped up. Furthermore, again in AI parlance, the usual feed-forward network (FFN) layers are essentially replaced with MoE layers. Each MoE layer usually makes use of one or more experts and has at least one gating function. DeepSeek’s AI makes use of mixture-of-experts, as do several other high-profile LLMs such as Mixtral by Mistral, NLLB MoE by Meta, and others. No one can say for sure whether MoE is the best or optimum way to devise generative AI. I’ve noted that it has upsides and downsides. It isn’t a silver bullet. The shock and awe of DeekSeek’s AI will certainly cause a rapid and wider pursuit of mixture-of-experts. Some will rush to include it. Others will be dubious and argue that the downsides outweigh the pluses. All in all, we are in for exciting times. Let’s give the last word for now to Aristotle: “Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives -- choice, not chance, determines your destiny.” We will have to wait and see whether MoE is a choice, a chance, or a destiny.

Here's your firmware update for February 1, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week was wild. DeepSeek came and changed the AI landscape, but it seems like the full impact of its arrival is still yet to be fully understood. Meanwhile, Garmin accidentally bricked many of its devices globally thanks to an errant update, and Android XR broke cover in our first hands-on look at the software. Al that and more of the other big tech news stories you might have missed from the week are recapped below, so you can catch up with everything then get on with your day. Plus, if you're after a way to spend your downtime this weekend, then don't forget to check out our picks for the 7 new movies and TV shows to stream this weekend. It’s been a rollercoaster week for the AI industry, with the DeepSeek app rocketing to the top of the Apple App Store and beating ChatGPT. DeepSeek is a Chinese startup who claim to have developed their deep reasoning model, R1, for a fraction of the price that US AI companies have invested in their technologies. It also offers people access to it for free in its chatbot and at a much reduced price as an API compared to OpenAI. The news that a Chinese company can produce an equivalent technology for a fraction of the price caused a complete crash of the share value of US tech companies that are heavily invested in AI. Nvidia came off particularly badly, with $600 billion being wiped off their stock value in just one day. Share prices have since recovered, but it doesn’t feel like the AI market will ever be the same again. Questions are already being asked about how DeepSeek managed to produce its AI model so quickly, especially after OpenAI claimed it had evidence of distillation of some of its models. Distillation is a development technique where you piggyback off another model’s learning, but is against the OpenAI terms and conditions of use. To make matters worse for DeepSeek, it appears that when questioned about which AI model is best, DeepSeek will sometimes refer to itself as ChatGPT, which some users consider a smoking gun. OpenAI released a statement on the matter, saying: “We know that groups in the PRC are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to try to replicate advanced U.S. AI models. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. "We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more. We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here.” This one may rumble on for a while yet. A tough few months of software quirks boiled over into a massive Garmin outage this week that saw users in their thousands completely lose access to their devices. A rogue GPS file accidentally pushed to Garmin wearables saw watches and trackers plunged into a boot loop dubbed the 'Blue Triangle of Death.' Few customers found they could escape, and even those who did encountered further issues with connectivity and synchronisation. The outage lasted well over 24 hours and we heard from hundreds of customers – owners of devices such as the Forerunner and Epix ranges, as well as more niche devices including Garmin's dive computers, cycling computers, and Approach Golf Range. Garmin has since fixed the underlying issue, but there are reports that some customers remain stuck in boot loops and without a device. Plenty have even told us they regret their Garmin purchases or plan to depart for companies like Apple. It's a PR disaster that has overshadowed the launch of the Instinct 3, and Garmin has some recovery work to do if it wants to avoid a Sonos-style scenario. Nvidia’s new graphics cards are here and… and they’re already gone, with stock sold out across the internet in lightning-fast time. Some of these highly sought-after GPUs will have been bought by legitimate gamers looking to upgrade their rig – and they’re in for a treat, with our RTX 5090 review highlighting that it’s a seriously powerful upgrade that approaches complete overkill performance. Our RTX 5080 review, meanwhile, reports that it boasts some solid gains at a more modest (but still not inexpensive) price. Unfortunately some Nvidia cards also seem to have been picked up by scalpers taking advantage of the limited availability to flip them for a profit on resale sites by listing the GPUs for several times their MSRP. Resale sites have also been flooded with listings that seem to be selling the new GPUs for prices closer to what they should cost – but when you take a closer look, you’ll see they’re promising to send you a picture of the graphics card you desire, rather than the real thing. So, our advice is to wait for another official drop so you don’t get tricked by a scammer or pay three or four times more for the GPU you’re after – and you can follow our live Nvidia RTX 5090 stock updates and Nvidia RTX 5080 stock updates trackers for info on when and where these drops will happen. Nothing shared a short video of its CEO Carl Pei this week. Normally that wouldn’t be super newsworthy, but as the camera zooms in on his glasses we see the words “Launch 4 March” reflected in the lens. A previous Nothing Phone 3 teaser suggested this would be the announcement date for its next smartphone, but now it’s all-but certain. What’s more interesting is a cut in the middle of the clip that seems to shift from a shot from a wide lens, to one from a telephoto lens – the latter of which is absent from previous Nothing phones. We’re taking this as a hint that the Nothing Phone 3 could have a triple-lens camera – with a telephoto camera joining the wide and ultra-wide lens setup found on the Nothing Phone 2. Thanks to a hands-on video from Marques Brownlee on his YouTube channel, MKBHD, we got our first look at Android XR and the Project Moohan prototype this week. While many details including price, release, and some specs are still a mystery, we did get to see aspects of the headset’s design and software. It looks a lot like a combination of the Meta Quest Pro and Apple Vision Pro. There’s no over-the-head strap but instead a Meta Quest Pro-like adjustable strap round the back, and the Android XR headset borrows the Quest’s optional light blockers to change between a VR-optimized and MR-optimized design. It also uses an external battery pack like the Vision Pro to help save weight. As for software, Brownlee’s video predominantly focused on Gemini’s integration – which looks impressive. Though many of the AI features look like they’d be much better suited to a pair of AR glasses, so while we expect Moohan will be impressive, we’re already waiting to see what XR hardware Samsung and Google will launch next. Our favorite wall-crawling superhero is finally back! The latest adaptation of Peter Parker to enter the fray is in Marvel’s new animated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. The show has a unique release schedule, though, as each week two episodes will be released instead of one – the first two of which debuted on Disney Plus this Wednesday (January 29). TechRadar’s senior entertainment reporter Tom Power has already seen all 10 episodes and says the show’s “a spectacularly fun ride” in his Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man review. Which is great news for Spidey fans, because two more seasons have been greenlit and the show’s creator already has “big ideas” for where it could go next. Hamish is a Senior Staff Writer for TechRadar and you’ll see his name appearing on articles across nearly every topic on the site from smart home deals to speaker reviews to graphics card news and everything in between.

There is a new Twist season in February, with another go at the Wonders format from last year. It will go live next week on Tuesday, February 4th. Quote from Blizzard On February 4, the Wonders XL format will end and the Wonderful Un’Goro format will begin. Wonderful Un’Goro is back to a 30-card format using the Wonders format, but with Journey to Un’Goro added. The following sets will make up the format: The Wonderful Un’Goro format will end with the February season and then Twist will be on hiatus. We will have more information about future Twist seasons in a future update. A new month also means we all received our ranked rewards from last month. You can let us know in the comments if there was anything particularly cool you got from the reward boxes or packs! We'll leave you with the Sweetheart Cardback reward for the February 2025 season.

Someone already corrected you, but there are far more decks than just Shaman. Please be better next time before acting like this Name checks out but actually stats do show that Shaman is over tuned and warps the meta.. Until you bring back open cups, you can't really call it inclusive esports. If people have to grind ladder each month (a miserable experience according to top players who do it - see meati and more), and that's the only way to qualify, you're missing out on many skilled players that do not have the same time. Why were open cups great? 1. Usually weekends, allowing people to have a hobby out if work and do well in it. 2. Conquest format, same as the actual tournaments they are hosting. Not the best 1 deck bo1 grinder, but people who managed to master multiple decks. 3. Less play required to qualify, allowing people with less resilience or less free time to qualify Without cups, I don't feel like HS is an esport anymore.

Title: Eli Hewson of Inhaler: ‘There’s so much nepotism in every facet of life’

Full Content:
When the four members of Inhaler walked in front of 80,000 people at Slane Castle in June 2023, they felt as if they’d tumbled down a rabbit hole and emerged blinking into a fantasy movie. “You can see how far back the hill goes, and you see the extent of people there. I remember turning to one of the guys and going, ‘What the f**k are we doing?’ And I remember being so nervous,” says Ryan McMahon, the drummer with the Dublin rock band. Eli Hewson, the group’s frontman, says: “I was expecting to get booed off the stage. Everyone was there for Harry Styles.” Seated beside him, Josh Jenkinson, who plays guitar, smiles and says that their friends and family were excited about Slane largely because it put Inhaler in the orbit of the former One Direction star, who was the day’s headliner. “All our girlfriends at the time were over the moon. It did genuinely feel we were in a scene from Lord of the Rings.” Styles was creating history as that rare pop star to headline the Co Meath venue. The day was equally significant for Inhaler, who confirmed their status as one of Ireland’s fast-rising major-label rock bands. Despite the jitters and concerns about being jeered into oblivion by the hordes of teenage girls, they are happy to report that the gig went fine. Two years later they are ready to take another leap forward with their glossy, crowd-pleasing third LP, Open Wide. It’s a slick, hook-filled affair that is brimming with easy-on-the-ear melodies (as in Eddie in the Darkness, the opening track), Coldplay-worthy “ooh ooh” choruses (Billy – Yeah Yeah Yeah) and finger-snapping grooves (the single Your House). It will appeal to all those Styles fans they won over at Slane – and even a few of those they didn’t. That’s partly thanks to the influence of the producer Kid Harpoon – Styles’s regular wingman in the recording studio – who encouraged Inhaler to push further and to connect with their inner pop stars. The other big draw is the charismatic presence of Hewson, who at moments sounds like a dead ringer for his father, Paul, known to some as Bono. Inhaler are understandably wary of coming across as some sort of novelty U2 offshoot: Baby Bono plus some pals from private school. (Three of Inhaler met at St Andrew’s College in Blackrock, one of Dublin’s most exclusive secondary schools.) Yet they are self-aware about their gilded backgrounds and understand the U2 factor is something they must negotiate. They can’t shut their eyes and hope it goes away. With or without them, people are going to draw a connection. “I always thought I was going to have a harder time than I actually did. My sister had a hard time,” the singer says about Eve Hewson, the actor. “There’s certain advantages to it.” You know, if you grow up in a house of music, you’re probably going to want to do music. Same if your dad back in the medieval ages was a blacksmith A famous father puts you in the spotlight, no question. “People coming for the first time to see you – you might sell a few more tickets in the beginning, or whatever. But it’s not going to make people come back,” says Hewson, a matey, down-to-earth 25-year-old who seems at pains not to project nepo-baby privilege. “You know what I mean? There is definitely a certain perception of you before people have heard you. So [you] kind of weigh it up. The other thing is that it’s not something we want to pretend isn’t happening. That would be silly.” On the other hand, Hewson doesn’t feel he’s playing life on easy mode by starting a band with friends. He has been surrounded by music his entire life: what’s so strange about wanting to pick up a guitar and sing? “It just makes me laugh. You know, if you grow up in a house of music, you’re probably going to want to do music. Same if your dad back in the medieval ages was a blacksmith. There’s so much nepotism in every facet of life.” Hewson shrugs, at pains to clarify that he isn’t complaining. “When it’s in the public eye ... you’re allowed give it a bit of scrutiny.” Of course, being a blacksmith and being the second-youngest child of Bono and Ali Hewson are two very different things. (That’s 18-year-old Hewson on the cover of U2’s 2017 LP Songs of Experience, as snapped by the music photographer Anton Corbijn). For one thing, people don’t spend all their time badmouthing blacksmiths on social media. With Bono it’s another story. For all his popularity, the U2 singer is also one of his generation’s most widely criticised rock stars – especially in Ireland. In the past 12 months alone the neotrad group Lankum have called him “Such a f****** West Brit” on stage in Dublin and Mary Coughlan has said she was “grossed out by the whole lot” of U2. How does Hewson feel about people continually taking potshots at his father? “I think I’m well used to it – like, I’ve seen it plenty. I’d just say get to know him first. That’s all I’ll say on it.” Inhaler look every centimetre the off-duty rock band sitting around a table in a hotel in South Dublin, a stone’s throw from their alma mater. Leather jackets, tight trousers, boho man jewellery, a tour manager who has ushered them to the venue straight from rehearsals: they tick all the boxes. Except one. Although their first two albums, It Won’t Always Be Like This and Cuts & Bruises, were well reviewed, they have none of the critical acclaim of fellow Dublin acts such as Lankum or Fontaines DC (whose 2018 show at the Tivoli Theatre, with The Murder Capital and Shame, they name as a life-changing gig for them). They radiate faint yet unmistakable traces of dorkiness – a trait they are happy to own. “We’ve always worn it on our sleeve when people meet us. It’s the same as when we do interviews and ... blah-lah ... we’re just, like, kind of dorks,” they say, speaking over one another. “I don’t think we’ve got to be conceptually cool. We’re just ourselves. We’re uncool sometimes.” Inhaler have also had to negotiate what might be called the “South Dublin” question. St Andrew’s is one of Ireland’s most expensive private schools. When you come from that background people make assumptions: that your life has been full of opportunity rather than adversity, that your tipple of choice is Heineken, that you have firm views on the state of the Leinster lineout. “It exists,” McMahon says of such inverse snobby. “But if you want to say that about one person ... No one says that about Radiohead or The Rolling Stones.” “It doesn’t matter,” Hewson adds. “But it wouldn’t be home without it.” Inhaler started when Hewson, McMahon and Robert Keating, their bassist, were at school in 2012. Three years later they met Jenkinson at a party. In their early years they were a “sh*tty metal band”, though they evolved into something more melodic when they discovered The Stone Roses – still one of their favourites. At this point it was decided that Hewson should take over from Keating as lead singer, which the retiring adolescent did with a degree of reluctance. (The name Inhaler comes from the fact that he had asthma in his teens.) “It was never a dream as a kid. I started singing out of necessity.” He adds, about overcoming shyness, “I’m definitely better than I was. I was bad a lot of the time ... It’s a miracle, really, to be honest.” With their first two albums they wrote songs largely so they would have material to perform live. The new LP is different as they went into the studio determined to grow as songwriters. That’s why they chose to work with Kid Harpoon. That was the least cool thing you could chose to do – ‘You’re in a band … It’s so lame’ The producer – real name Tom Hull – cracked the whip during recording sessions at RAK Studios in London (where The Pogues made Fairytale of New York). He didn’t hesitate to tell them if he felt a tune wasn’t cutting it. “Honesty is probably the most valuable thing in a studio setting from your producer,” Hewson says. “We had loads of songs that weren’t finished. We went to him hoping that he’d pull it together. And he was, like, ‘You’re not done’. So we had to go back and finish them. We actually found a different way of writing that was more effective.” It is fashionable to decry the death of the old-fashioned four-piece band. Guitar music has certainly become less culturally central – the reality is that the biggest event in rock this year will be the return of Oasis, a band who peaked in 1995, four years before Hewson was born. But Inhaler feel that is starting to change. Bands are back. “When we were in school it was all Ed Sheeran. No offence to him: we still love pop music. But I’m talking about bands. That was the least cool thing you could chose to do – ‘You’re in a band … It’s so lame’. Now you’ve got Sam Fender smashing it in the UK, Fontaines, Murder Capital, Last Dinner Party, Wunderhorse … There’s a lot of great music to listen to,” Hewson says. “I don’t know if that’s a result of the stagnant pop music we’ve heard ... It’s nice to hear something visceral. It feels more analogue-y than digital, which is refreshing. I’m happy about it.” A big summer awaits. Inhaler are touring Britain, the Americas and Australia. Hewson’s birthday coincides with one of Oasis’s Croke Park dates and he hopes to attend. (He knows Noel Gallagher a bit through his father.) Then there is a show at St Anne’s Park in Dublin – their biggest Irish headline concert to date, with a capacity of 20,000. “In the beginning we went to the UK and we gigged a lot there. We always felt we were missing home,” Hewson says. “It’s nice to be able to facilitate a gathering in your hometown. What an honour. We’ll do our best job. I think it will be great with the new music.” Open Wide is released on Friday, February 7th; Inhaler play St Anne’s Park, Dublin, on Friday, May 30th © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Celestica Inc. (CLS): Leveraging AI Demand with Specialized Chips

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Must-See AI News and Ratings You Might Have Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) stands against other must-see AI news and ratings you might have missed. Northland Securities recently issued a rating for a stock amidst the DeepSeek AI frenzy. The firm noted that it isn’t concerned about the AI models just yet and that it doesn’t expect big tech giants to cut their capital expenditures when they report their earnings either. In light of this, the CEOs of tech giants such as Meta and Microsoft have recently defended their massive spending, noting how it was crucial to stay competitive in the new field. Investors panicked after news spread over the weekend about a Chinese startup DeepSeek having released AI models that were built using less power and chips. In response, executives of tech giants are saying that building huge computer networks has been crucial to serving growing corporate needs. Even then, investors have been losing their patience with the huge amounts of spending and a dearth of hefty payouts. READ NOW: These 29 AI Electricity and Infrastructure Stocks Are Crashing Due to DeepSeek News and 10 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz DeepSeek has been causing a stir in the AI world and refuted the gap that previously existed between the AI capabilities in China and the US. After the first Chinese version of ChatGPT was released, there was a lot of disappointment in China considering it was not on par with ChatGPT. However, DeepSeek’s AI models have shifted the AI narrative completely. Not only has it sparked a frenzy in the US, but even its domestic competition has been pressurized. This was made evident when Alibaba released a rival to DeepSeek’s model on the Lunar New Year. According to the company, the “Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms … almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B”. Even though DeepSeek’s AI models have been impressive, there is still skepticism and confusion regarding the demand for high-end AI chips and the need for power to run AI-centric data centers. “There’s plenty of uncertainty over what the true demand for state-of-the-art chips, semiconductor fabrication plants and energy will be”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a circuit board with components depicting the intricate electronic componentry products the company produces. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) offers a range of product manufacturing and related supply chain services. On January 30, Barclays raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $139 from $91 and kept an “Overweight” rating. The rating has been issued following quarterly results. According to the firm, investors are valuing Celestica based on 2026 projected earnings, driven by the demand for specialized chips called ASICs which remain a medium-term trend. In particular, 2026 captures the run rate revenue of the TPUv6, Google’s latest generation AI accelerator. The firm further noted that Meta Platforms aims to launch a new ASIC program that could compete with the TPU program in terms of expertise and capability. Overall, CLS ranks 6th on our list of must-see AI news and ratings you might have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of CLS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CLS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Not every country’s financial market is suffering fallout from Donald Trump’s return to the White House — and money managers say relations with the U.S. are playing a growing role in deciding where to invest. As the likes of Colombia and Mexico are rattled by tariff fears, assets of nations seen as benefiting from close ties with the U.S. leader, like Argentina and Ecuador, are getting an extra lift. While that’s particularly true in Latin America, where most countries count the world’s largest economy as a key trade partner, the Trump "friend-or-foe” factor is impacting emerging-markets across the globe, from India to Vietnam. "Winners here are not the traditional ones that we’d think about — there’s a new set of countries that will emerge as winners,” Amer Bisat, a managing director and head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock, said at a recent industry panel. In today’s world, a country that "aligns itself politically to the U.S. ends up being the winner — and that becomes much more of a transactional relationship.” In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.

"Is DeepSeek an alternate universe that bodes terribly for Nvidia's pricing down the road? Hey, anything's possible," he said. "But if you had to design the most punitive way to bring down the price of this great stock, you'd invent something like DeepSeek." Earlier this week, investors were stunned to find out DeepSeek developed an AI model that it said cost $6 million to make — significantly less than what its peers spend on such programs. The company also claimed that the model could outperform that of industry favorite OpenAI. Wall Street concluded Big Tech may not need to spend as much money on highly-advanced chips from Nvidia, which until now seemed like the only option for companies looking to dominate in the AI world. Worries of lower earnings sent Nvidia shares plummeting, with the stock losing nearly $600 billion in one session, the largest single-day drop in market history. Cramer conceded that investors' response is logical if DeepSeek's model actually cost so little to make, forcing Nvidia to bring down prices. But he said there's a possibility that DeepSeek spent more on its program than investors believe, referencing a new report from SemiAnalysis, a semiconductor research and consulting firm. SemiAnalysis suggested the way DeepSeek framed the development of the new model is misleading, saying the company could have actually spent more than $500 million. Cramer was also skeptical that executives at tech giants like Meta, Tesla and Oracle would have invested so much money in Nvidia without performing proper due diligence. DeepSeek wasn't a secret, he continued, it just received a lot of attention this week. "I think the SemiAnalysis piece is spot on," he said. "It may just be one more long knife aimed at Nvidia, and nothing more." Nvidia declined to comment. DeepSeek did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Title: “Made In America” Is Easier Said Than Done
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/31/made-in-america-is-easier-said-than-done/

Bringing manufacturing back to the United States, colloquially known as nearshoring, is poised to significantly reshape trucking and rail networks across North America. The push for localized supply chains promises shorter delivery times and reduced geopolitical risks, but it also brings challenges in infrastructure and logistics. The companies solving these challenges are going to be critically important and could be an investment opportunity. Nearshoring offers two big advantages and a few smaller challenges. First, it can help companies avoid tariffs and FX headaches. Second, it can shorten lead times and improve inventory management. Trump’s original push for tariffs and COVID-19’s supply chain shock have made a strong business case for bringing manufacturing back to the United States. The cost of manufacturing domestically is higher than manufacturing abroad. However, having confidence that your supply chain can deliver and not having to deal with political spats carries significant value. Unfortunately, the higher costs associated with manufacturing domestically generally need to be passed on to the consumer. Higher prices for some goods are tolerable, but if it’s broad-based then it can be inflationary. An additional challenge is that the United States currently faces some constraints on manufacturing. Labor is one – we addressed it last month here – and transportation is another. Put simply, we need our domestic logistics to level up to accommodate a push for more manufacturing at home. Aerial view of cars at the Volkswagen plant in Puebla, Mexico, on August 4, 2018. - Mexican ...

(Photo by Jose Castanares / AFP) (Photo credit should read JOSE CASTANARES/AFP via Getty Images) Mexico has become America’s largest trade partner, recently overtaking China as the top exporter to the United States. It is well positioned geographically and broadly has lower wage costs and a greater supply of labor for factory-level jobs than the United States. US companies have invested significant capital in Mexico over the past several decades and many companies send parts back and forth from the US to Mexico for different parts of the manufacturing process. Canada’s geographic proximity has also made them a critical trade partner for the U.S., but mainly in the realm of natural resources. Crude oil, liquefied natural gas, lumber, and other mined commodities consistently supply US markets. North American trade has become increasingly interwoven and has accelerated as scrutiny on China has mounted. According to the Brookings Institution, the U.S. imported $472.5 billion of goods and services from Mexico while Canada imported $15.6 billion worth of goods. The United States also accounts for over 40% of Mexico’s imports. This partnership is bidirectional and has led to gains for both the United States and Mexico. Generally speaking, Mexican manufacturing shouldn’t be seen as a direct competitor to American manufacturing but rather as a complement. Mexican factories use parts imported from the U.S. and vice versa; corporations have allocated capital across both countries to drive manufacturing efficiencies and try to remain competitive with low-cost goods from China. While investing in Mexico means navigating complicated labor laws and exposure to cartel crime, the low-cost labor makes it a necessary input for effective North American manufacturing. The degree to which companies can nearshore and access cheap labor in Mexico is important because it impacts the mix of goods that can be effectively manufactured outside of China. High-value goods like electronics and automotive components can be manufactured and sold domestically with cheaper labor in Mexico and capitally intensive factories in the United States combining to offer a competitive product. Potential shifts in US import policy, specifically with regards to tariffs on Mexico and Canada could jeopardize this balance. The ability to manufacture efficiently in the United States could actually take a hit if we make trade with Mexico and Canada more difficult. Consequently, while we are broadly optimistic on North American manufacturing, we’d shy away from trying to pick winners or losers who might be impacted by tariffs or trade disputes. Instead, we would suggest focusing on investment opportunities in companies who facilitate trade and transport unfinished components and final goods to their points of sale. The economy is strong, and nearshoring has momentum, the space is probably worth a look. 370225 03: Tractor-trailer rigs are parked at the Petro truck stop May 29, 2000in El Paso, TX. Many ... [+] of the rigs now have modern wireless communications as well as cable television, refrigerators, double bunk beds, and microwave ovens. In the last few years trucks have become more like a home/office on the road. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers) The value of U.S. freight by truck with Canada and Mexico has steadily increased since the mid-2000’s and amounts to over $70 billion as of December 2023, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. With nearshoring comes shorter supply chains, and an increase in the need for valuable truck space, meaning trucking fleets need to navigate the shifting trade landscape to accommodate retailers’ just-in-time inventory approach. With trucking, the two general approaches to shipments are full truckload (FTL) and less-than-truckload (LTL) – the latter meaning a single truck carries shipments from multiple customers and the former meaning all goods in the container are destined for the same location for the same customer. Generally, LTL shipments are more expensive on a per-unit basis but offer manufacturers greater flexibility in getting finished goods to retail customers or storage warehouses. Instead of committing and paying up for larger shipments that take up entire truckloads, companies can have goods shipped with smaller, more frequent LTL runs which allow for quick inventory adjustments. These quicker adjustments are helpful during labor strikes or supply chain disruptions. LTL shipments account for just about 10-15% of the industry’s volume today, but the rise in e-commerce and necessary shorter transit times presents a compelling investment opportunity for trucking firms down the road. Companies like FedEx Corp. (FDX) and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. (ODFL), who specialize in LTL shipping, dominate the market and offer solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises that don’t have the scale to fill up whole truck beds with raw materials or finished products. Conversely, the FTL industry is highly fragmented and relies heavily on brokerage firms to match shippers with small and mid-size carriers. Trucking is also incredibly fragmented. According to RXO Inc (RXO), the top 15 FTL carriers combine for less than 10% of total market share. More than 95% of carriers operate 10 trucks or less! Although still critically important for the food, pharmaceutical, and consumer goods industries, it’s a heavily diluted market with minimal barriers to entry. Artificial intelligence and technological innovation is coming for the trucking industry. Something as simple as improving routing could lead to significant cost savings. Technology enabling real-time tracking of vehicles, predictive maintenance, and dynamic route adjustments based on traffic or weather conditions could all lead to bottom line improvements. Better routes and more well-maintained trucks reduce fuel consumption, repairs, and idle/empty drive times. Firms with enough capital to own trucking fleets and invest in technology like XPO Logistics (XPO) can integrate trucking fleets with warehouse management systems to streamline order processing and reduce downtime. Technology can also help tackle regulatory complexity. Importing goods from Mexican maquiladoras, factories that import materials and export the finished goods, requires expertise in customs and border clearance. Facilitating the clearance of goods through U.S. customs and navigating documentation, duties, and inspections means third-party logistics firms like C.H. Robinson (CHRW) with integrated customs brokerage services are crucial for nearshoring to succeed. Finally, the United States is facing an acute shortage of truckers, especially those who are interested in long haul journeys. The adoption of automated driving for semi-trucks would be huge for the industry. Regional routes often involve repetitive patterns and well-defined paths, making them ideal candidates for early implementation of autonomous driving systems. These systems can handle highway driving and reduce driver fatigue, while allowing human operators to focus on more complex urban or last-mile navigation. Currently, according to the American Journal of Transportation, the U.S. has a shortage of more than 80,000 truck drivers, a deficit expected to by 2030. This is compounded by the composition of trucking labor force - the average age of truck drivers exceeds the median labor force age in the U.S. Companies focusing on autonomous driving are therefore going to be crucial if nearshoring momentum is going to keep picking up. Companies like Aurora Innovation (AUR) have teamed up with technology giants like Nvidia (NVDA) to mass produce its integrated driverless systems. Furthermore, companies like Tesla have been working on Semitruck technologies for years. LIVINGSTON, MONTANA – APRIL 5: Boeing 737Next generation fuselages manufactured by Spirt AeroSystems ...

On March 18th, 2017 Boeing signed a US$3 billion dollar deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines for 30 737's with an option for 30 more. (Photo by William Campbell/Corbis via Getty Images) There is no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling the logistics of nearshoring, and trucking is not the only solution. Intermodal transportation, the integration of tracking and rail, is set to grow substantially as trucking routes shrink and the just-in-time approach to inventory management continues to permeate American manufacturing. Intermodal transportation isn’t a novel idea, but the relationship between the two transportation methods will have to deepen to accommodate nearshoring and the current demographics of the trucking labor force. Intermodal transportation relies heavily on strategic partnerships between railroads and trucking companies to optimize the process of getting FTL shipments onto rail cars and shipped across North America. All of the big players in FTL trucking are attached to the hip with Class I railroads like BNSF Railway, Union Pacific (UP)and Norfolk Southern (NSC), so the ability to leverage scale and in-house logistics is of utmost importance. Rail hasn’t seen the same levels of growth as trucking over the last 20 years but is still well-suited for transporting large volumes of goods over long distances, making it a cost-effective option for long transports. Although the actual volume of rail freight is less than that of trucking, rail networks are essential to shortening trucking routes and reducing congestion on highways. Investments in rail infrastructure, including expanded rail yards, upgraded tracks, and digitization of intermodal facilities are all going to be essential in the years to come. However, investing in infrastructure is expensive and scale brings advantages in safety standards and cost efficiency. We wouldn’t be surprised to see M&A activity in the space pick up as nearshoring continues. Even if there’s no M&A, we still expect the space to have significant funding needs. Any build out of intermodal transportation networks is going to be capital intensive. Electrification, new tracks, and new freight cars all have significant up front costs with long pay back periods. Specialized lenders and private credit shops will have opportunities to engage in asset-backed lending with long pay back periods. Nearshoring is poised to uplift the significance of both rail and trucking industries. As manufacturing moves closer to home, the demand for efficient, localized logistics will only grow, requiring substantial innovation and capital. The integration of rail and trucking through intermodal transportation will be critical to maintaining the speed and flexibility needed for just-in-time delivery systems. Meanwhile, the trucking sector will see increased demand for trucking and third-party logistics as businesses continue to seek more agile, responsive supply chains. Technological advancements will also play a pivotal role in reducing operational costs for shippers. For investors, this evolving landscape presents opportunities in the picks and shovels needed for transporting goods from point A to point B. As nearshoring continues to gain momentum, the future of U.S. freight transportation will be defined by innovation, collaboration, and a renewed focus on North American trade, and is worth keeping a close eye on.

Title: Local organizer wants to fix REI from the top—and REI is fighting to keep her off the ballot

REI is having an identity crisis. Originally formed as a co-op in 1938, it earned a strong reputation in our community for its commitment to environmental issues, fair treatment of workers, and climate education initiatives. These values fostered generations of loyal customers who felt good about supporting the company. But over the past few years, REI has appointed a decidedly corporate-leaning board of directors, with former executives from Exxon Mobil, Starbucks, and McKinsey. Employees identify this shift as the start of anti-worker treatment at the company, like unpredictable scheduling and waves of layoffs, which the company attributes to slow sales. And while it’s true that REI’s finances have fluctuated in recent years, reports of its financial death are greatly exaggerated. In 2020, in the first year of COVID-19, the company sold its newly completed Bellevue headquarters to Meta for $390 million. And then when people took to the outdoors for safe exercise, REI’s sales boomed: up 37% in 2021 to a total of $3.7 billion, reporting a $97.7 million profit. REI reported a slight uptick to $3.8 billion in revenue in 2022 and $3.76 billion in 2023, but somehow still managed to lose millions in both years. That mismanagement at the top has resulted in repeated waves of layoffs: 167 people were laid off in 2023, then 357 in 2024, and 428 more this month, shuttering its beloved outdoor education Experiences arm. In 2022, REI’s New York City SoHo location was the first of its 187 stores to unionize. Nine others, including their Bellingham store, have since followed suit. REI has refused to negotiate a contract with the REI Union for over two years now and retained Morgan Lewis, a notorious union-busting law firm that also represents Amazon and SpaceX, and previously counted Donald Trump as a client. This week, 63 lawmakers including Senator Bernie Sanders sent a letter to REI urging them to bargain fairly with their workers and stop their union-busting activity. CEO Eric Artz announced his retirement last week, with new CEO Mary Beth Laughton taking over on February 3. She inherits a company with shaky finances and a once-sterling public image that has suffered in recent years. REI claims they have a transparent and democratic process for their annual board elections, yet candidates must be approved by the current board to even appear on the ballot to be voted on by its members. Workers are currently ineligible to run for the board, as well. However, Shemona Moreno, a local climate activist, longtime REI member, and REI Union-endorsed candidate, is running to hopefully steer REI back to its roots. The current board will decide which candidates will be allowed on the ballot at their meeting on Monday, February 3. You’re running to help return REI to its roots. Can you introduce yourself to folks who don’t already know about what you do? Shemona Moreno: I'm the executive director at 350 Seattle. We're a local grassroots non-profit focused on climate justice and the intersections of climate and workers' rights, abolition, and a variety of issues because we believe we can't solve our climate crisis in a silo. I've been with 350 Seattle since right after Trump was elected the first time. I was a nanny at the time. That was an activating moment for me to move from supporting from the sidelines to becoming more of a participant in my community and learning how to be an activist. So I started off as a volunteer with 350 Seattle, and then I had the opportunity to join the staff in 2018. I became executive director two years ago, and am starting my third year as ED now. I wouldn't say I've always been a climate activist, but it's something I grew into. My mother was really into activism, specifically around racial justice issues and police accountability, so I grew up going to actions and action-planning meetings with my mom. And here I am now doing similar work, working with people who care about what our future is going to look like. The question is: how are we thriving in our future and not just surviving? What are some projects you’ve worked on with 350 Seattle that you’re proud of? Around 2018 when the Green New Deal came onto the scene, we made a bit of a pivot at 350 Seattle to be focused more on solutions that will replace a lot of this infrastructure that we're trying to dismantle. We still need water. We still need food. So how are we doing that sustainably? What are the solutions that work with the community instead of against it? We ran a campaign called Solar Schools, working with other unions like the Seattle Education Association and MLK Labor to take levy money and invest it in renewable energy. We felt strongly we should be putting solar panels on top of our schools, and provide heating, cooling, and air filtration to all of our schools to keep our kids safe. We won that, and those projects are now underway. Another campaign we ran and won was called Healthy Through Heat and Smoke, which was another levy fight. We pushed Seattle Parks to invest in proper heating and cooling because out of the 26 community centers in Seattle, only three or four of them have air conditioning. In the 2021 heat dome, people died because they didn't have anywhere to go. What’s the pitch for your candidacy? What separates you from REI’s current board members? I’m a voice for the people who do not have representation on that board. I'm a voice for the workers. I'm also a voice for the people who actually care about preserving the planet, the air, and the water, and the considerations that's going to take. As you look at these issues that are confronting REI, what’s your vision for what REI could be? What is REI now? What are they doing? And who are they aligning themselves to? We're seeing them get rid of a lot of the things that support the members and the workers. We just saw a bunch of layoffs. So what's next? What else is REI going to compromise on for the sake of making money for a few people? I think we could learn a lot from the workers who actually speak to the consumers at brick and mortar stores. The members have good ideas. There's value there. I think you could do an audit and ask, what do people want from REI? And not just people who have lots of money, but regular people who could say, ‘I would go there a lot more if it was accessible to me in this way.’ People are now thinking carefully about how they spend their money. Does REI want to be one of those companies that's put on a boycott list? Or do they want to be one of the companies that's celebrated? We could have a company here that's thinking about us, that cares about the issues that we care about. And right now, it seems like REI does not. Do you have any comment on the news that REI is canceling its Experiences arm? Is this the kind of thing you would support if you were on the board? When I first joined REI as a member, I did some of the Experiences before I bought anything. I was just getting into hiking and learned about different tools, how to keep myself safe, what are the things that I need to know when I start journeying out into the wild to make sure I’m doing it respectfully. I think those Experiences set REI apart from its competitors for me. So this news is a bummer. I'm curious what led to that decision. It seems like the capitalist mindset of ‘it wasn't making money, therefore, it wasn't useful.’ But do we always have to be thinking about whether or not something is making money? Is that a good metric of real value? With over 3,000 members supporting your candidacy and lawmakers urging REI to listen to their workers, do you see this as a mandate for your board seat? It is a clear mandate. I believe 100 percent that things need to change. At the very least, we should change the way the co-op board operates. There should be representation from workers. It's not hard! We saw PCC do it and PCC is still around. It didn't implode by adding two workers' voices onto that board. Another place we can start is bargaining with the union in good faith. Listening to your workers around safety issues and things that need to be fixed, that is also not an impossible task. You'll probably spend less money on it than you would paying the union-busting firm that's represented the likes of Amazon and Trump. Like, come on. Do you really want to align yourself with them? What does success look like for this company if they're going to continue to alienate their base? REI is now claiming they never received your application for the board election. But you’ve shown me screenshots of your submission, sent ahead of the deadline. What gives? I emailed my application before the deadline. The best case scenario is someone didn't check their spam folder. The worst case scenario is REI is afraid of a pro-staff candidate for Board. This is not the REI I know and love. I applied to run for the board to be a voice for the people in green vests who make REI great but who are not allowed a voice on the co-op’s board of directors. More than 3,000 REI members and customers signed a petition in support of my candidacy for the board to bring REI back to its roots, and ensure the company walks their talk on sustainability and worker rights. REI must listen to its member-owners. So where does this go from here? If REI rejects your candidacy, are you planning to run again? There’s a bill in the Washington State Legislature that would require Washington businesses designated as a co-op to include employees on the board and follow a transparent democratic process for elections. I personally rally readers to support that bill. Contact your legislators and make sure they're hearing all of our voices across Washington State in support of that bill. That’s a good next step if I don't make it onto the board. And I'm open to running again if that is something workers in the union would like of me. But this isn’t all about me. It's about the workers at REI and the union. I'm just an ally, and this is how I can be in support of the union and the workers, by following their lead. I would surely do it again. We have to stand up and hold them accountable because at the end of the day, they're making all this money, but we're the people who actually buy things. We're the people that work. They can't do this without us. They need us. Conor Kelley covers labor for The Stranger. He is currently being priced out of Capitol Hill.

Title: Beyond benchmarks: How DeepSeek-R1 and o1 perform on real-world tasks

Time Published: 2025-01-31T19:53:58Z

Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More DeepSeek-R1 has surely created a lot of excitement and concern, especially for OpenAI’s rival model o1. So, we put them to test in a side-by-side comparison on a few simple data analysis and market research tasks. To put the models on equal footing, we used Perplexity Pro Search, which now supports both o1 and R1. Our goal was to look beyond benchmarks and see if the models can actually perform ad hoc tasks that require gathering information from the web, picking out the right pieces of data and performing simple tasks that would require substantial manual effort. Both models are impressive but make errors when the prompts lack specificity. o1 is slightly better at reasoning tasks but R1’s transparency gives it an edge in cases (and there will be quite a few) where it makes mistakes. Here is a breakdown of a few of our experiments and the links to the Perplexity pages where you can review the results yourself. Our first test gauged whether models could calculate returns on investment (ROI). We considered a scenario where the user has invested $140 in the Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla) on the first day of every month from January to December 2024. We asked the model to calculate the value of the portfolio at the current date. To accomplish this task, the model would have to pull Mag 7 price information for the first day of each month, split the monthly investment evenly across the stocks ($20 per stock), sum them up and calculate the portfolio value according to the value of the stocks on the current date. In this task, both models failed. o1 returned a list of stock prices for January 2024 and January 2025 along with a formula to calculate the portfolio value. However, it failed to calculate the correct values and basically said that there would be no ROI. On the other hand, R1 made the mistake of only investing in January 2024 and calculating the returns for January 2025. However, what was interesting was the models’ reasoning process. While o1 did not provide much details on how it had reached its results, R1’s reasoning traced showed that it did not have the correct information because Perplexity’s retrieval engine had failed to obtain the monthly data for stock prices (many retrieval-augmented generation applications fail not because of the model lack of abilities but because of bad retrieval). This proved to be an important bit of feedback that led us to the next experiment. We decided to run the same experiment as before, but instead of prompting the model to retrieve the information from the web, we decided to provide it in a text file. For this, we copy-pasted stock monthly data for each stock from Yahoo! Finance into a text file and gave it to the model. The file contained the name of each stock plus the HTML table that contained the price for the first day of each month from January to December 2024 and the last recorded price. The data was not cleaned to reduce the manual effort and test whether the model could pick the right parts from the data. Again, both models failed to provide the right answer. o1 seemed to have extracted the data from the file, but suggested the calculation be done manually in a tool like Excel. The reasoning trace was very vague and did not contain any useful information to troubleshoot the model. R1 also failed and didn’t provide an answer, but the reasoning trace contained a lot of useful information. For example, it was clear that the model had correctly parsed the HTML data for each stock and was able to extract the correct information. It had also been able to do the month-by-month calculation of investments, sum them and calculate the final value according to the latest stock price in the table. However, that final value remained in its reasoning chain and failed to make it into the final answer. The model had also been confounded by a row in the Nvidia chart that had marked the company’s 10:1 stock split on June 10, 2024, and ended up miscalculating the final value of the portfolio. Again, the real differentiator was not the result itself, but the ability to investigate how the model arrived at its response. In this case, R1 provided us with a better experience, allowing us to understand the model’s limitations and how we can reformulate our prompt and format our data to get better results in the future. Another experiment we carried out required the model to compare the stats of four leading NBA centers and determine which one had the best improvement in field goal percentage (FG%) from the 2022/2023 to the 2023/2024 seasons. This task required the model to do multi-step reasoning over different data points. The catch in the prompt was that it included Victor Wembanyama, who just entered the league as a rookie in 2023. The retrieval for this prompt was much easier, since player stats are widely reported on the web and are usually included in their Wikipedia and NBA profiles. Both models answered correctly (it’s Giannis in case you were curious), although depending on the sources they used, their figures were a bit different. However, they did not realize that Wemby did not qualify for the comparison and gathered other stats from his time in the European league. In its answer, R1 provided a better breakdown of the results with a comparison table along with links to the sources it used for its answer. The added context enabled us to correct the prompt. After we modified the prompt specifying that we were looking for FG% from NBA seasons, the model correctly ruled out Wemby from the results. Reasoning models are powerful tools, but still have a ways to go before they can be fully trusted with tasks, especially as other components of large language model (LLM) applications continue to evolve. From our experiments, both o1 and R1 can still make basic mistakes. Despite showing impressive results, they still need a bit of handholding to give accurate results. Ideally, a reasoning model should be able to explain to the user when it lacks information for the task. Alternatively, the reasoning trace of the model should be able to guide users to better understand mistakes and correct their prompts to increase the accuracy and stability of the model’s responses. In this regard, R1 had the upper hand. Hopefully, future reasoning models, including OpenAI’s upcoming o3 series, will provide users with more visibility and control.

Title: Starbucks and Workers United turn to mediator as contract talks stall

Starbucks (SBUX+0.19%) and the labor union representing roughly 10,000 employees have agreed to bring in a mediator to help move forward with ongoing contract negotiations. The decision follows months of bargaining that had previously paused in December, after union workers argued the company had yet to present a comprehensive offer. In a joint statement, both Starbucks and the union expressed their commitment to working with a mediator to address the “complex issues” at hand and reach fair agreements for both sides. “Bringing in a professional mediator is a positive step toward securing fair union contracts,” said Michelle Eisen, a 14-year barista and bargaining delegate. “We’re optimistic that Starbucks will finally move off their fixed position on wages and benefits as we continue these negotiations.” Union workers have been vocal throughout the process, which began in April 2024, including during a high-profile strike last holiday season. On Christmas Eve, baristas walked off the job to demand better wages, benefits, and working conditions. The strike helped build momentum for the union’s efforts, as Starbucks employees continue to push for a fair deal. In addition to ongoing contract talks, Starbucks is making changes to streamline operations. The company plans to lay off some employees in the next two months, though it remains unclear whether these layoffs will affect only corporate roles or include frontline workers. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol also announced recently that the company’s “open-door” policy, which previously allowed anyone to enter stores, would now limit service to paying customers only. This policy shift includes ramping up security at select locations and even closing stores where security measures are not proving effective. As part of his “Back to Starbucks” strategy, Niccol has made other moves to reshape the company. Recently, Starbucks hired two former Taco Bell executives to help lead changes in store operations and customer service. The company is also cutting its menu by 30% and removing the up charge for non-dairy milks, which have grown in popularity among customers. With a mediator now in the mix, both sides aim to resolve their differences while finding common ground. Similarly to Starbucks, workers at Costco (COST+2.70%) and Amazon (AMZN+0.20%) have pushed for better pay and benefits, with the latter striking. At Costco, a strike is looming, despite the retailer’s wage boost offer. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

What do Nvidia (NVDA), The New Yorker, Chess.com and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have in common? They are all clients ElevenLabs, a startup that generates realistic audio with the help of A.I. Co-founded in 2022 by former Google (GOOGL) engineer Piotr Dabhowski and former Palantir strategist Mateusz Staniszewski, the London-based company has made waves in Silicon Valley for its voice cloning capabilities. Over the past year, the startup has more than tripled its valuation to a whopping $3.3 billion after a closing a $180 million round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Iconiq Growth, the company announced yesterday (Jan. 30).

You can opt out anytime. The capital will be used to expand ElevenLabs’ capabilities and make its A.I. voices more “expressive and controllable,” the company said. “Speech is how we naturally communicate. This funding moves us closer to a world where digital interactions happen by voice—fluid, natural and as effortless as a conversation,” said Staniszewski, who serves as CEO of ElevenLabs, in a statement. ElevenLabs’ products include tools that build interactive voice agents, generate custom voices or sound effects via text prompts and help voice actors monetize A.I.-generated audio. According to the company, its technology has been embraced by workers at more than 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies. Customers range from peer A.I. companies like Perplexity AI, which uses ElevenLabs to generate podcasts summarizing the news, to publishers like The Washington Post and The Atlantic, which utilize the technology to create audio versions of stories. Last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams tapped the startup to contact New Yorkers with multilingual robocalls. The rise of A.I.-generated voices hasn’t been without controversy. Last year, audio experts claimed that technology from ElevenLabs was used to generate robocalls mimicking the voice of former President Joe Biden to voters in New Hampshire during the Presidential campaign. ElevenLabs subsequently suspended the account behind the fake robocalls. The company said its latest funding will be used to bolster A.I. safety and ensure its products are deployed without harm. To date, ElevenLabs has raised $281 million in venture funding. Its top backers include Sequoia Capital, Smash Capital, Broadlight Capital, SV Angel, NFDG and Salesforce’s venture arm. The A.I. voice industry generated $3.5 billion in revenue in 2023. That figure is expected to exceed $21 billion by the end of the decade, according to data from Grand View Research.

Title: Trump Treasury Department Exits Global Climate Alliance Pushing Green Mandates on Financial Sector
URL: https://freebeacon.com/energy/trump-treasury-department-exits-global-climate-alliance-pushing-green-mandates-on-financial-sector/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T19:15:18Z
Full Content:
The Treasury Department withdrew the United States from a global climate alliance that was launched to push the financial sector to adopt green mandates. The so-called Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System was originally created to pressure banks and financial institutions to meet sweeping global climate targets, many of which have been set during United Nations summits. The Treasury Department said late Thursday that the alliance's mission doesn't align with the Trump administration's "priorities to grow the U.S. economy and American jobs." The announcement is part of the Trump administration's move to exit what it considers to be harmful global climate agreements. And it is the latest signal to the international community that the United States under Trump's leadership will seek to prioritize domestic energy production over commitments to bolster green energy and fight global warming. Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research, told the Washington Free Beacon that the withdrawal is a "major victory for consumers" and that the alliance "only existed to push a radical climate agenda onto taxpayers." The alliance's efforts, according to a review of its website and governing documents, fall in line with the broader green investing movement, which pushes financial institutions to divest from fossil fuel production and infrastructure and invest in green energy to stop climate change. "Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, with impacts that are felt worldwide and necessitate urgent, coordinated action," the group states. The group is also one of the most high profile alliances of its kind worldwide—the alliance boasts 144 members across more than 90 countries, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England. The Biden administration had joined the alliance in February 2022. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive action ordering the State Department to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accords. "President Trump is committed to pursuing an American First policy agenda," the State Department said in a subsequent internal memo confirming it had executed Trump's order. "The Paris Agreement prompted restrictions on America's ability to harvest vast natural resources and constraints on the American economy through oppressive domestic regulations." And the withdrawal comes two weeks after the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative—a private sector alliance whose mission largely mimicked that of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System—said it would suspend all operations. That decision was triggered after a number of the group's members, including trillion-dollar asset manager BlackRock, withdrew ahead of Trump's inauguration. "For too long ESG elites like BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink have been using political influence to manipulate federal agencies into pushing ESG on consumers and stunting the American economy," Hild, of Consumers’ Research, told the Free Beacon. "But thanks to President Trump's swift actions, the administration continues to remove the rot that is ESG from American institutions," he continued. "There is still more work to be done, and Consumers' Research remains committed to holding institutions accountable if they continue their senseless devotion to destructive ideological fads like ESG at the expense of taxpayers and consumers."

Title: Can We Still Solve Climate Change?
URL: https://www.ipsnews.net/2025/01/can-still-solve-climate-change-2/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T19:07:40Z

Monday, February 3, 2025 SAN FRANCISCO, California / APEX, North Carolina, Jan 31 2025 (IPS) - When it comes to climate change, the awful news has been coming thick and fast. We now know that in 2024, the Earth’s average temperature exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. Extreme weather seems to be multiplying, with shocking fires in Los Angeles and storms striking Europe and America’s east coast since the start of the year. U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his country will turn its back on the ambitious Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ latest annual summit—COP29 in Azerbaijan—ended in November with complaints it had done too little to change the narrative. Some even questioned whether the UN’s ongoing exertions were a waste of time, and whether annual global climate summits were still worth doing? Are things really so bad? Let’s break down the news piece-by-piece and look at each issue in turn. How bad is it that we have broken the 1.5C ceiling? It’s pretty bad. It means we can expect extreme weather like heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, and flooding to increase in frequency and severity. It’s also going to affect food production, harm many plant and animal species, and risk sending the world over several “tipping points”, such as faster melting of ice in the Arctic, Antarctic, and elsewhere, causing sea-level rise. If you don’t like that our weather is getting more extreme, then sadly it’s too late. We’ll all have to get used to it, and adapt accordingly. That said, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are some silver linings. First, the world has actually been doing a lot to fight back. Partly prompted by major international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, countries have been actively finding ways to reduce emissions, such as investing in green technologies and working on new policies that affect pretty much everything we do. Whether it’s new energy efficiency programmes in our homes and offices, efforts to protect our forests, or the rise in hybrid and electric vehicles, a lot is happening. Perhaps the biggest transformation has been the growth of solar and wind power, which is now considerably cheaper and more efficient that earlier sources of electricity like coal or natural gas. The pay-off is clear, with countries like the UK, Sweden, and Denmark already cutting their greenhouse gas emissions in half since the 1990s. Another silver lining of our efforts to cut emissions is expert projections for temperature rise in the longer term. Before the Paris Agreement, some were predicting temperatures to go up by 4-6C by 2100, which would be catastrophic for humanity and the planet; an extinction event for modern civilization. Now, the estimates sit around 2-2.8C, depending on whether countries honour the goals they’ve set themselves. These numbers are still bad, but nowhere near as terrifying as they were. So yes, 1.5 is bad and we will need to redouble our efforts to make sure it doesn’t get much worse. But we shouldn’t give up hope just yet. What does President Trump’s decision to leave the Paris Agreement mean? No one can deny that U.S. leadership greatly helps our global efforts to combat climate change. Still, there are several reasons why we shouldn’t panic. First, as mentioned above, the world is already on a long-term path to cut emissions. The new U.S. administration may wish to “drill, baby, drill,” but renewables will continue to rise. Why? Because they’re cheaper than the alternatives. As an experienced business leader, President Trump knows as well as anyone that companies are motivated by profits. They will look for the most cost-effective energy option. In many cases, this will mean renewable energy. Secondly, even if the U.S. does leave Paris and change its domestic policies, there is an inertia in systems. The outgoing Biden administration, which had pledged $3 billion for the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF), has already handed over $2 billion. They’ve also spent much larger amounts on supporting the U.S. transition to a green economy. This is money the new President will not be able to take back. Plus, a country as big and powerful as America can’t turn its entire economy around overnight. For instance, during President Trump’s first term, emissions in the U.S. continued to fall, even if he himself did not support this. Thirdly, even American presidents aren’t all powerful. There are many other interests and alternative viewpoints in the U.S. Others who might disagree with President Trump will likely step up and try to fill the gap. For instance, business leader Michael Bloomberg has just announced that he will help cover U.S. financial obligations to the UN and its climate work. There is precedent for this, too. Back in the 2000s, a lot of progress was made on climate change at the state and city level throughout the U.S., even though President George W. Bush generally didn’t support it. Finally, there has been a shift in the centre of gravity when it comes to climate change. The U.S. remains important, but on climate change it matters less than it once did. Under Presidents Obama, Biden, and Trump himself, U.S. emissions have fallen. They now represent about 11% of the global total, down from 30% in 1970. These days, U.S. emissions are dwarfed by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). These are the countries whose leadership will be needed in the decade to come. There are signs that big corporate players are also turning away from their climate pledges. For instance, Blackrock just left the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition. What does this mean? The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) was announced at COP26 in 2021. It brings together corporate leaders from the financial services sector to support the transition to an ambitious “net-zero” emissions economy. However, after the recent U.S. election, some big U.S. banks left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which is part of GFANZ. Now, Blackrock has left a similar coalition for asset managers; which is also a part of GFANZ. This is not good news. It probably marks a symbolic victory for politicians who had been pressuring big corporate interests to step back from their climate pledges. In some ways, it mirrors the recent abandonment by several big American companies of their DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programmes. At this stage, it is hard to know how much of a genuine impact this will have. For every company trying to appease the Trump administration by backtracking, it is likely there will also be those—like insurance companies—whose profits are being so badly impacted by climate change that they will be unlikely to change their positions. The latest UN climate summit brought no major breakthroughs but it did achieve some modest successes. Credit: Shutterstock. Was COP29 really a failure? No. Although the latest annual UN climate summit didn’t result in any big breakthroughs, it did achieve some modest successes. For instance, wealthy industrialized nations agreed to increase annual funding for developing countries from US$100 billion to US$300 billion annually by 2030. This is far less than the US$1.3 trillion many experts believe is needed to combat climate change, though that number was included as a goal for 2035. Although US$300 billion is an improvement on the previous amount, it’s not what developing countries were hoping for, which was closer to $500 billion by 2030. Other outcomes from COP29 include agreement on standards for carbon markets, which means carbon trading is likely to increase and new finances might flow to the Global South. What’s more, several countries announced that they would strengthen their pledges—known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—under the Paris Agreement. These included Azerbaijan, Brazil, the UK, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Shouldn’t COP29 have done a lot more, given the urgency of the climate crisis? As we have noted in an earlier article for IPS (“Are Climate Summits a Waste of Time?”), the UN climate process is designed to help us make incremental progress, year after year, decade after decade. And it has. It may seem like the pace of change is too slow—and it often is—but the UN has kept the ball moving over many, many years, and can take credit for helping us forward much more than we realize. Isn’t Azerbaijan an oil producer? Why hold meetings on climate change in fossil fuel states? Yes, it is. In fact, many countries that have hosted the annual UN climate summit in the past have also been fossil fuel states. These include the UAE, UK, Poland, South Africa, India, and Indonesia. In fact, Poland (a major coal producer), has hosted the climate COPs three times! Why is this? The hosting of the COPs is decided by the relevant regional groupings of the UN. So, each region gets its turn every few years to decide who hosts. The fact is, many countries produce fossil fuels, and often these are the ones with the financial and organizational capacity to host large events like a UN summit. As we have argued in the past (“Global Cooperation on Climate Change: What Have We Achieved and What Needs to Happen Next?”), we believe hosts should be judged not on their fossil fuel status, but on whether the annual COP they host is a success. If we judge the hosts by what the UN summits achieve, then fossil fuel countries have a mixed record. COP29 was not a breakout success, but the recent COPs in Egypt and the UAE achieved a surprising breakthrough, with agreement on a loss and damage fund. Also, some of these fossil fuel producers are slowly transitioning their economies away from selling oil, coal and gas. Azerbaijan, for instance, is promoting its tourism sector. Are UN climate COPs still worth holding? Do they need to change? As mentioned above, we believe UN climate summits are worth it, as they have helped the world make significant progress over the past thirty years. That said, some people think the COPs need to change how they operate. For instance, there were 65,000 people at COP29, but only a few thousand were actually involved in the UN negotiations. Isn’t this a sign something needs to be done differently? We think the critics miss the point. While it’s true that the UN climate COPs have become large and unwieldy, they also serve many purposes. First, the world pays attention to these mega-events, which ratchet up the political pressure. Prime ministers, presidents, and other world leaders often attend, knowing the eyes of the world are on them. This, too, raises expectations and sometimes leads to better outcomes. Not only that, but the COPs are often teeming with other folks from every sector and country, all eager to talk about what they are doing, listen to others, and build networks, coalitions, and alliances. Sometimes, these lead to powerful “coalitions of the willing”. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) mentioned earlier is an example of this, as is the Global Methane Pledge, a coalition uniting 159 participating countries (and the European Commission) in pursuit of a goal to cut methane emissions 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. On other occasions, participants can generate new ideas that eventually end up in the formal UN negotiations. Recent examples include discussions on agriculture and water management. Currently, it appears as if climate change in the context of oceans and human health may soon be added to the formal discussions. Of course, the climate COPs could certainly be improved. For instance, the number of formal agenda items could be reduced, since the negotiations are now very complex. However, the UN COPs continue to serve an important function and should, in our opinion, include a wide range of stakeholders. Moisés Savian, Brazil’s Secretary of Land Governance, Territorial and Socio Environmental Development at COP29. He looks forward to COP30 which will be held in his country. Credit: Umar Manzoor Shah/IPS The next COP is taking place in Belém, Brazil in November 2025. What’s on the agenda, and what needs to happen before then? The road to COP30 in Brazil lies through Bonn, Germany, which is the location for the annual preparatory meeting each June. UN climate watchers will be paying close attention to the two-week session in Bonn to see if we are on track to make any breakthroughs in Brazil. The key issues where observers would like to see progress at COP30 include: We would also like to see evidence at COP30 that the recently-created Loss and Damage Fund is starting to have an impact, and that the role of oceans in climate change mitigation and adaptation is being taken more seriously. Even though the situation is bad, is there still hope? Yes. Despite the recent bad news, we remain optimistic. History shows we have made positive strides already. We are convinced now is the time to double down on global, collaborative efforts to combat climate change, and that the UN COPs provide important, regular milestones to meet, review our progress, and strengthen our pledges. One piece of good news lost among all the big, bad headlines relates to the leadership at COP30. Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago has been chosen as president of COP30. He played a significant role in the Rio+20 negotiations and has been one of Brazil’s top civil servants for many years. His expertise when it comes to climate change and COPs is impressive. The appointment of such a consummate professional is a positive sign of how seriously the Brazilian government is taking its responsibilities as the COP30 host. Prof. Felix Dodds and Chris Spence have participated in UN environmental negotiations since the 1990s. They co-edited Heroes of Environmental Diplomacy: Profiles in Courage (Routledge, 2022). Their next book, Environmental Lobbying at the United Nations: A Guide to Protecting Our Planet, is due for release in June 2025.

As of Dec. 2024, corporate disclosures based on public statements and filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that had a material impact on stock price of companies listed in the NYSE or NASDAQ, increased in both frequency and severity by 6.0% and 7.0%, respectively, relative to the two-year period ending in Sept. 2024. According to the report, SAR identified 10,536 high-risk adverse corporate events, from a population of 4,605 U.S. public companies, as of the two-year period ending Dec. 31, 2024, by uniformly applying a single-firm event study analyses to test stock price reaction on corporate disclosures disseminated via public statements and filings with the SEC. The market capitalization losses related to high-risk adverse corporate events, amount to approximately $10 trillion, an increase of $1.1 trillion relative to the two-year period ending Sept. 2024. The Information Technology sector topped the charts with $2.8 trillion, followed by Consumer Discretionary and Health Care, with $1.6 and $1.4 trillion, respectively. "The frequency and severity of adverse corporate events are the dominant drivers that foment securities litigation risks for directors and officers of U.S. public companies. As of the fourth quarter, issuers now face an increase of about $1 trillion in market capitalization losses linked to high-risk adverse corporate events that materially impacted stock price during the preceding two years. The securities plaintiffs' bar will take advantage of increasing complexity around risk factor disclosures after the Supreme Court punted on the high-severity securities class action against Meta last quarter. As a result, the securities litigation risks for issuers will be greater in 2025," said Nessim Mezrahi, Co-Founder and CEO of SAR. Key Takeaways: The securities litigation risk footprint of the Information Technology sector exhibited the greatest change during the last quarter of 2024, followed by Communication Services and Financials. SAR quantifies the securities litigation risk footprint based on the economic impact of adverse corporate events, together with the change in market capitalization of constituent companies within each of the eleven industry sectors, based on the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). As of Dec. 2024, the sector with the highest market capitalization losses as percentage of the sector-specific market capitalization is Consumer Discretionary at 19.18%, followed by Health Care and Industrials, with 19.15% and 17.63%, respectively. Information Technology companies faced the greatest market capitalization losses per high-risk adverse corporate event, amounting to $1.73 billion, followed by Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary with $1.59 and $1.2 billion, respectively. The sector with the highest median SAR Risk Score is Health Care with a median score of 29.11%, followed by Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary with 25.44% and 24.21%, respectively. This independent, semi-annual U.S. equity research report presents an appendix with the median SAR Risk Scores across all GICS groups, industries, and sub-industries. The SAR Platform provides users with the near real-time securities litigation risk footprint, with full transparency at the corporate disclosure level, for public companies that trade in the NYSE and NASDAQ.

Carvana (CVNA) is advancing 3% after JPMorgan increased its price target on the shares to $350, representing the highest target on the Street. Why JPMorgan Hiked Its Price Target JPMorgan analyst Rajat Gupta raised his price target on CVNA to $350 from $300 while keeping an Overweight rating on the name. A customer buying a used car with the help of a finance specialist. Asserting that the company's balance sheet is strong, Gupta believes that its unique emphasis on online sales has enabled it to stand out among its peers, while boosting its top and bottom lines. Moreover, the analyst expects the Street's average estimates for the firm to climb this year, and he thinks that the multiple of CVNA stock can rise going forward. Gupta wrote the note after conducting a thorough overview of Carvana's business. Another Bank Upgraded CVNA This Month On Jan. 7, RBC Capital hiked its rating on CVNA to Outperform from Sector Perform. As reasons for the upgrade, the bank cited the stock's recent decline and its belief that the company could sell more vehicles than expected. It placed a $280 price target on the shares. The Recent Price Action of CVNA Stock In the last month, the shares have jumped 41%, while they are up 9% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of CVNA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) just landed a game-changing win, which drives its share by 14% this early afternoon. The FCC has granted Special Temporary Authority (STA), clearing the way for ASTS to test its first five commercial BlueBird satellites across the U.S. The kicker? These satellites connect directly to unmodified smartphones on AT&T and Verizon networksno special software, no hardware tweaks. The initial Block 1 satellites will provide non-continuous coverage with 5,600 cells, but the upcoming Block 2 BlueBirds, packing 2,400 square-foot communication arrays, promise speeds up to 120 Mbps. Thats a serious leap forward in space-based cellular broadband. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with ASTS. And the market is paying attention. AST SpaceMobile has secured major backing from AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) this year, plus fresh U.S. government contracts. On top of that, theyve locked in deals with 45+ mobile network operators, giving them access to a staggering 2.8 billion subscribers worldwide. The ability to deliver full cellular broadband straight from spacewithout requiring users to change a thingsets ASTS apart in a market still dominated by text-only satellite services. Its a big step toward closing connectivity gaps and creating a new frontier for mobile networks. The FCC green light isnt just a regulatory winits validation that AST SpaceMobiles tech is the real deal. With five U.S. gateways already in the works, the company is fast-tracking its commercial rollout. As ASTS scales from testing to full deployment, its seamless integration with existing networks could be a game-changer for emergency communications, rural coverage, and even emerging markets. Investors are watching closely, and with ASTS pushing the limits of what satellite broadband can do, this could be the start of something huge. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Cool-headed Charlie Hempenstall drove Wesley into the Leinster Schools Senior Cup quarter-final claiming 18 points in their win over Belvedere College at Energia Park on Friday afternoon. The Leinster under-19s outhalf was a step ahead of everyone in engineering the first upset of the competition to make the last eight. Wesley hit the ground running from the off, working a smart lineout for Tom Burke to go over in the right corner. The touchline conversion proving no problem for Hempenstall. It wasn’t long before Belvedere captain Charlie Lyons was binned for an illegal tackle and Hempenstall sent Matthew Wystepek over on the right. Hempenstall found the posts from the touchline again for 14-0 in the 13th minute. He then rubbed salt into Belvedere’s wounds with a 17th minute penalty. David Gimore was away and a flashy attack ended with Hempenstall arrowing a kick for Wystepek to grab and ground for 22-0 in the 25th minute. Belvedere finally managed to gather their game, number eight Paul Dunne blasting off the base of a five-metre scrum for a badly needed try. The Ballinteer school’s quick, clean rucking was the secret to a multi-phase attack finished by prop Evan Caddow, joined by Hempenstall’s extras to make it 29-5 at the break. Belvedere blasted back into the game as their forwards upped the ante and their backs came alive. Lorcan Butler’s close-range burst and a similar effort from Cillian McCann delivered two quickfire tries, both converted by Jonathan Garrihy. The sense of desperation had dissolved as Garrihy was content to add a penalty from a promising position for 17 points in 18 minutes. Now, the pressure had shifted to Wesley' shoulders. It was then Hempenstall weaved a wonderful pattern for a phenomenal individual try which he also converted. Then was the calm after the storm. Another fluid move allowed fullback Max Colbert to stroll over on the right, Hempenstall adding the conversion. A late push from Belvedere saw replacement Eugene Isong claim their fourth try to reduce the deficit to make it a 16-point loss. WESLEY: M Colbert; M Wystepek, D Gilmore, N Heatley, J Duffy; C Hempenstall, J Freyne; E Caddow, T Burke, J Cullen, A Gordon, I Reid, L L’Estrange, S McMullin (capt), T Campbell.

Title: DeepSeek is driving demand for Nvidia's H200 chips, some cloud firms say
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/deepseek-fuels-nvidia-h200-demand-cloud-cheaper-workload-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-31T17:01:00Z
Full Content:
Some cloud providers are experiencing a notable uptick in demand for Nvidia's H200 chips after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek this month burst into the race for the winning foundation model. Though the stock market caught wind of the powerful yet efficient large language model on Monday, sending Nvidia's stock down, DeepSeek has been on the radar of AI researchers and developers since it released its first model, V2, in May. But the performance of V3, released in December, is what made AI developers sit up and take notice. When R1, the company's reasoning model, which competes with OpenAI's o1, was released in January, demand for Nvidia's H200s started climbing. "The launch of DeepSeek R1 has significantly accelerated demand for H200," said Robert Brooks, a founding team member and vice president of revenue at the cloud provider Lambda. "We've seen such strong interest that enterprises are prepurchasing large blocks of Lambda's H200 capacity even before public availability." DeepSeek's models are open source, which means users pay very little to use them. But they still need hardware or a cloud computing service to use them at scale. Business Insider talked to 10 cloud service and AI inference providers. Five reported a rapid increase in demand for Nvidia's H200 graphics processing units this month. Amazon Web Services and CoreWeave declined to comment. Oracle, Google, and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment. This week, AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia have made DeepSeek models available on their various cloud and AI developer platforms or provided instructions for users to do so themselves. Nvidia declined to comment, citing a quiet period before its earnings release on February 26. AI cloud offerings have exploded in the past two years, creating a slew of options beyond the mainstays of cloud computing such as Microsoft Azure and AWS. The demand has come from a range of customers, including startups, individual researchers, and massive multinational firms. "We've heard from half a dozen of the 50 largest companies in the world," Tuhin Srivastava, a cofounder of the inference provider Baseten, told BI. "I'm really not exaggerating." On Friday, semiconductor industry analysts at SemiAnalysis reported "tangible effects" on pricing for H100 and H200 capacity in the market stemming from DeepSeek. Colette Kress, Nvidia's chief financial officer, said on the company's November earnings call that total sales of Nvidia H200 GPUs had reached the "double-digit billions." Karl Mozurkewich and his team at the cloud provider Valdi saw H200 demand ramp up throughout January — and at first, they didn't know why. The Valdi team doesn't own chips; it acquires capacity from existing data centers and sells that capacity to customers. The company doesn't know every use case for each chip it makes accessible, but it polled several H200 customers, and all wanted the chips to run DeepSeek. "Suddenly R1 got everybody's attention — it caught fire — and then it kind of went exponential," Mozurkewich said. American companies are eager to take advantage of DeepSeek's model performance and reasoning innovations, but most are not keen to share their data with a Chinese firm. That means they can either use an API offered by a US firm or run the model on their own hardware. Since the model is open source, it can be downloaded and run locally without sharing data with DeepSeek. Mozurkewich said most of Valdi's H200 demand was coming from startups. "It appears the market is reacting to DeepSeek by grabbing the best GPUs available for testing as quickly as possible," he said, adding, "This makes sense, as most companies' current GPUs are likely to continue to work on ongoing tasks they've been allocated to." Though many companies are still testing and experimenting, the Valdi team is seeing longer-term requests for additional hardware, suggesting an uptick in demand that could last beyond DeepSeek's initial hype cycle. DeepSeek's research paper indicates its models were trained with less powerful hardware than US models. This efficiency has spooked the stock market. Companies like Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft have invested billions in AI infrastructure, with billions more on the way. Investors are concerned about whether all that capacity will be needed. DeepSeek was created with fewer, relatively weak chips (though the number is hotly debated). Training chips aside, using the models for inference is a compute-intensive task, cloud providers say. "It is not light and easy to run," Srivastava said. The size of a model is measured in parameters. More parameters require more compute. The most powerful versions of DeepSeek's models have 678 billion parameters. OpenAI's GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion, while Meta's largest Llama model has 405 billion. Srivastava said most firms were avoiding the 405 billion-parameter Llama model if they could help it, since the smaller version was much easier to run. DeepSeek offers smaller versions too, and even its most powerful version is cheaper to run, which has stoked excitement with firms that want to use the full model, the cloud providers said. H200 chips are the only widely available Nvidia chip that can run DeepSeek's V3 model in its full form on a single node (eight chips designed to work together). You can also spread it across more lower-power GPUs, but that requires more expertise and leaves room for error. Adding that complexity almost inevitably slows down performance, Srivastava said. Nvidia's Blackwell chips will also be able to handle the full V3 model in one node, but these chips have just begun shipping this year. With demand spiking, finding enough chips to run V3 or R1 at high speed is tough if they haven't already been allocated. Baseten doesn't own GPUs; it buys capacity from data centers that do and then tinkers with all the software connections to make models run smoothly. Some of its customers have their own hardware in their own data centers but hire Baseten to optimize model performance. Its customers especially value inference speed — the speed that enables an AI-generated voice to converse in real time, for example. Srivastava said DeepSeek's capacity at the open-source price was a game changer for its customers. "It does feel like this is an inflection point," he said. Have a tip or an insight to share?

Title: The Top Specialty PR Firms in 2025
URL: https://observer.com/list/best-specialty-pr-firms-2025/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T17:00:51Z
Full Content:
In an era where perception is currency, specialty PR firms are the brokers of influence Why does specialty PR matter? Because in an economy driven by perception, those who control the narrative control the market. And in a country where culture and commerce are inextricably linked, they don’t just shape industries—they shape the world we live in. Specialty PR firms shape what people see, hear and believe. On a micro level, they dictate which restaurants are impossible to book, which hotels are suddenly the destination and which films, albums and IPOs dominate cultural and financial conversations. On a macro level, they steer industries, influence policy narratives and define what matters in public discourse. In an era where perception is indistinguishable from reality, these PR firms don’t manage visibility but manufacture it. Specialty firms operate with precision. They don’t waste time trying to make a finance executive “relatable” or an indie musician “mainstream.” They know exactly where influence lives and how to embed clients within the conversations that matter. A hospitality PR firm doesn’t just push a hotel—it builds mythology around it. A tech PR firm doesn’t just announce funding rounds—it positions a company as an innovator before the market even realizes it’s relevant. And this matters to everyone. The stories people engage with, the trends they adopt, the brands they trust—these aren’t accidents. Specialty PR firms ensure that what rises above the noise isn’t what’s loudest but what’s designed to dominate. In a world oversaturated with content, they filter. For better or worse, they decide what gets remembered. Looking into 2025, these are the best specialty PR firms in the categories that matter most to Observer. Nightlife and dining PR engineers desire. It’s the whisper campaign that turns a tucked-away speakeasy into a celebrity haunt, the strategic leaks that make a restaurant impossible to book before it even opens and the viral moment so perfectly executed that the cocktails are practically copyrighted. It’s knowing which influencers to plant near the DJ, which critics to invite (or mysteriously forget), how to position a new tasting menu as the next gastronomic revolution and how to spin a kitchen meltdown into “an off-night” rather than a full-blown disaster. Whether launching a buzzy rooftop lounge, securing a Michelin nod or keeping a legacy institution relevant in a fickle industry, PR defines the scene itself. In nightlife and dining, perception is currency. “Creativity drives success." — Co-Founder Eva Karagiorgas It’s been a delicious year for Ilana Alperstein and Eva Karagiorgas’ ten-year-old PR firm. In 2024, Mona Creative added nearly 100 new clients and saw 35 percent year-on-year growth, an impressive feat in an industry where trends move at the speed of a viral TikTok. Named agency of record for the iconic estiatorio Milos brand worldwide, the firm also won celebrated clients like H&H Bagels, Dominique Ansel Bakery and Acru from NA:EUN Hospitality―the team behind Atomix, hailed widely as one of the world’s best restaurants. Mona was at the center of the year’s most high-profile restaurant stories, overseeing the openings of Catch Hospitality's The Corner Store and Tao Group's Crane Club. Mona handled PR for two additions to Miami’s Design District: Nami Nori’s December expansion and the forthcoming opening of Matsuyoi. The agency remains deeply embedded in David Chang’s Momofuku empire, including his social media-famous Majordōmo in Los Angeles, which had a wildly successful NYC pop-up last year. They’re also behind the much-anticipated Kabawa and Bar Kabawa, opening in February in the former Ko Bar space, featuring a prix-fixe menu helmed by Paul Carmichael, Momofuku’s head of culinary development. Beyond restaurants, Mona’s influence extends across food media and publishing. They represent James Beard-winning cookbook author and TV personality Hawa Hassan, whose Vogue-covered wedding in April 2024 was as much a media event as a personal milestone. They also repped the March launch of two-time James Beard and Webby Award-winning Sporkful host Dan Pashman's first book, Anything’s Pastable. monacreative.co “Integrity is our north star. Telling things the way they are is always the best approach.” — Founder Hanna Lee Hanna Lee Communications dominated the hospitality PR game in 2024, with some of the year’s biggest dining and spirits stories tracing back to its team. Café Carmellini by Andrew Carmellini and Ghee Indian Kitchen by Niven Patel and Mohamed Alkassar both landed coveted James Beard Award semifinalist nods, a testament to HLC’s knack for positioning clients at the center of industry acclaim. The firm continued its streak of high-impact launches, including the new Locanda Verde at Hudson Yards, The Portrait Bar and a slate of top-tier venues spanning New York, Miami and beyond. Celebrating 21 years, Hanna Lee's global reach now extends from New York to Nairobi, championing brands that shape the future of hospitality, from luxury hotels to world-class bars, spirits brands and distilleries. The firm's PR playbook doesn’t just generate headlines—it crafts legacy. That strategy paid off with two PRNews Platinum Awards: Best Restaurant/F&B Campaign for Woody Creek Distillers’ William H. Macy Reserve Straight Rye Whiskey and Best Podcast for Hospitality Forward, now heading into its seventh season. Beyond press, HLC continues to invest in the industry’s future. HLC Meet the Media champions journalism’s evolving landscape, while New York Bartender Week—returning in November 2025—spotlights bartending as both an art form and economic force. hannaleecommunications.com “I encourage everyone on the team to know what the media writes, how they write and who they write for.” — Founder Steven Hall Attending an industry event with Steven Hall is like touring a city with its mayor. After nearly 30 years, Hall PR remains the gold standard for those seeking the spotlight in nightlife and dining, and the founder's stature as an industry guru continues to draw established and emerging clients. Operating as both a power broker and cultural translator, 2024 was a banner year for the firm, marked by a slew of high-profile openings, milestone anniversaries and the kind of deep-rooted industry relationships that make Hall PR an enduring force. Legacy clients Carmine’s and Virgil’s celebrated 35 and 30 years, respectively, while Simon Oren’s Chef Driven Group—Hall PR’s very first client—continued its expansion with Acadia and Sempre Oggi. Aquavit hit the decade mark of holding two Michelin stars, and Chef Vijay Kumar of Semma was named a James Beard semifinalist for Best Chef NYS. Hall PR opened Wayward Fare in Prospect Heights with Akhtar Nawab and debuted Mango Bay, an Afro-Caribbean hotspot helmed by rising star Chef London Chase. Hall opened Cesar, Chef Cesar Ramirez’s two-Michelin-star restaurant; YongChuan, the Sichuan/Ningbo Chinese spot; Lungi, a Sri Lankan/Southern Indian eatery; and Medium Rare, a steak-frites brand from D.C. Already this year, Hall opened Chez Fifi from Sushi Noz owners David and Josh Foulquier, which swiftly became one of Manhattan's most sought-after reservations. Another Hall PR client, The Bronze Owl, was instantly dubbed “Manhattan’s hottest new cocktail bar.” The firm also oversaw the debut of Nōksu, a fine-dining enclave hidden beneath the 32nd Street subway station, where grilled mackerel with brown butter and squab with gochujang agrodolce is redefining underground luxury. Expanding its global influence, Hall PR signed on with Japanese food brand Kayanoya while continuing to broker licensing deals for Tokyo’s Garde properties, bringing Japanese brands stateside and vice versa. And in Harlem, Melba Wilson’s unstoppable empire is now part of the Hall PR family. hallpr.com "A company’s growth is directly tied to making people feel valued and dedicating time to cultivating strong leaders. When you invest in capable, forward-thinking leaders, you ignite a culture of innovation, accountability and unstoppable passion." — Founder Rachel Harrison In 2024, Rachel Harrison's eponymous PR agency secured Michelin Keys for Eastwind Hotel & Bar, NoMad London, Wildflower Farms, Auberge Resorts Collection and Crossroads while positioning Chef Dominique Crenn as a media sensation with placements in Bon Appétit and Cherry Bombe. The firm’s strategic storytelling landed Thailand as the filming location for The White Lotus season three, generating over 3 billion media impressions. In nightlife, RHC launched venues like Ànimo! and Revelie and signed legendary NYC institution Raoul's ahead of its 50th anniversary. RHC further solidified its industry impact with the "Manhattan Manhattan" campaign for Great Jones Distilling Co. and its comms strategy to ensure Superbueno was ranked #27 on the World's 50 Best Bars list (and #2 on North America's 50 Best Bars). "We’ve been leveling up year after year," Harrison says to Observer of the culture she's built. "Our low turnover allows us to continuously nurture and train a team of smart, dynamic and wildly creative professionals. Watching this team evolve into some of the most talented, visionary creatives I’ve ever worked with is something I’m immensely proud of—and it’s exactly what fuels our success." At the tail end of 2024, RHC brought on notable bars, including award-winning Sip & Guzzle and Press Club in Washington D.C. Blending trend-savvy editorial perspectives with strategic media outreach, RHC continues to shape the conversation in dining and nightlife. wearerhc.com “There will always be an arsenal of PR tactics to deploy, but those aren’t the campaigns you phone home about.” — Founder Gia Vecchio Foxglove has always punched above its weight in nightlife and dining PR, but 2024 was the year it leveled up in every direction. Gia Vecchio’s seven-year-old firm—which maintains a long and ever-growing client list of restaurants, chefs, bakeries, books and indie hotels—doubled its team, adding NYC industry heavyweight Liza Prijatel Thors (formerly of The Door) as vice president. It also expanded operations to Texas, picking up an award-winning roster of restaurants across Dallas, Houston and Austin. The firm’s expertise now extends far beyond restaurants, securing OpenTable as a major client and becoming the agency of record for food and beverage at Wynn hotels. Meanwhile, Foxglove’s influence in the luxury hospitality space continues to grow, snagging Cape & Kantary Thailand—two luxury, five-star properties—and taking on two of celebrity chef Laurent Tourondel's restaurants within his Mid-Atlantic expansion. Foxglove also deepened its authority in beverage and craft cocktails, signing Lunazul Tequila under the Heaven Hill portfolio and top-tier bar groups from Dear Irving to Experimental Group. The stately flower may have elegant spikes, but in the PR game, Vecchio's Foxglove is proving itself just as sharp. Foxglove isn’t slowing down in 2025, stacking high-profile wins that further cement its dominance in hospitality. The firm is leading the charge for Wonder’s ambitious Mid-Atlantic expansion, working to position the on-demand dining disruptor as a category-defining brand. In the spirits world, Foxglove has signed on with Cooper Spirits, handling several of its most esteemed labels, including Slow & Low. Meanwhile, the firm is bringing the adrenaline-fueled luxury of F1 Arcade to Philadelphia, ensuring the immersive racing experience makes a splash in a city primed for high-energy entertainment. Proving its track record in the industry’s upper echelon, Foxglove played a pivotal role in eight campaigns for 2025 James Beard Award-nominated restaurants and chefs, turning culinary excellence into headline-making moments. foxglovecommunications.com Luxury Travel PR sells fantasies. It’s the campaign that transforms a secluded island retreat into the next jet-set destination, the carefully placed feature that makes a $50,000-a-night safari lodge feel essential before the season’s bookings vanish and the media strategy that positions a heritage château as the discreet escape for power players. It’s securing glossy spreads, curating who gets invited to that ultra-exclusive press trip and ensuring the right whispers about a resort’s guest list make the rounds. Every detail—from the first embargoed preview to the last perfectly staged Instagram post—turns geo-tags into status symbols. In luxury travel, PR isn’t really about visibility but making sure the right people see it and everyone else wants to. “Empathy isn’t just a value—it’s a strength. When people feel cared for, solutions often follow naturally.” — Account Manager Ashley Mir Imagine PR had a powerhouse 2024, expanding its global footprint with a roster that reads like a high-end travel wishlist. Gabriele and Andreas Sappok's firm added Walk Japan, the country’s premier walking tour operator, and eriro, an ultra-luxe Austrian Alps retreat reachable only by cable car. Austria’s Forsthofgut, famed for its sprawling mountain spa, and Portugal’s W Algarve, home to a mix of luxury suites and residences, further cemented Imagine’s reputation for representing exclusive hospitality. The firm’s expansion into Africa included Stanley Safaris, a boutique operator crafting bespoke journeys across the continent and South Africa’s highly anticipated Spier Hotel, set to open in 2025 with a village-style design in the Cape Winelands. Switzerland’s legendary Tschuggen Collection and Iceland’s Sky Lagoon, with its newly opened Turf House inspired by Viking architecture, rounded out Imagine’s deepening influence in experiential luxury. In Florence, Imagine took on the historic Hotel Brunelleschi, built within the city’s oldest standing tower, while also securing The Broadway Collection as a client. But the year’s biggest coup? MJ The Musical—its first standalone show, with a global PR strategy positioning it as an essential NYC travel experience. For a firm that has long blended travel with cultural cachet, 2024 was the year Imagine PR proved that high-end hospitality and world-class entertainment belong in the same conversation. imagine-team.com Gizem Ozcelik continues to parlay out-of-the-park creativity with an intensive media strategy to produce game-changing client results. That approach is what led hospitality disruptor Generator and Freehand Hotels to seek the agency for representation across their portfolio and their foray into third-party management with the opening of the iconic Paramount Hotel in Times Square, focusing on boosting the profiles of brand leadership. GO PR will also spearhead Generator's 30th-anniversary efforts in 2025. Ozcelik has been working with the brand since 2016, helping to single-handedly change the perception of the hotel market in the U.S. and set the stage for the Freehand acquisition. In 2024, GO PR also expanded its wellness business, winning Naturopathica spas, tasked to to double the brand’s footprint in 2025 with openings in Aspen and Phoenix, as well as the Ballers social-sports brand from former Fitler Club Founders. The agency continues to add to its tentpole of boutique hotel launches; for the debut of Philadelphia’s indie Hotel Anna & Bel, GO PR secured over six billion impressions spanning 200 hits, Ozcelik tells Observer. go-pr.com “Sometimes the most creative ideas may not deliver immediate results, but will support the long-term goals." — Founder Melanie Brandman Melanie Brandman's eponymous PR agency hit its highest revenue in history last year, a feat that’s particularly impressive considering the hospitality industry’s post-pandemic reckoning. Along with a long list of stalwart accounts like COMO Hotels and Resorts and Ritz-Carlton properties, The Brandman Agency had a string of powerhouse wins in 2024, including the Peninsula Hotels’ global portfolio and IHG’s Luxury and Lifestyle brands (Six Senses). Brandman also unveiled Carlton Cannes, a Regent Hotel, with a major activation at the Cannes Film Festival. The agency orchestrated La Mamounia’s 100th-anniversary celebration, transforming the Moroccan landmark into a media magnet, drawing coverage in Vogue, Condé Nast Traveler and The Financial Times with over 54 million impressions. More than 35 percent of Brandman's clients have been with the agency for six years or more, including La Mamounia (16 years), Rome Cavalieri and Raffles Singapore (8 years each) and Experience Scottsdale (12 years). The Peninsula New York’s refurbishment campaign—complete with an exclusive Vogue100 rooftop event—showcases how Brandman curates moments that redefine brands. brandmanagency.com "My senior team appreciated me walking away, knowing we would get better business instead. That's the advantage of owning my own agency and being smart about the long game in PR.” — Founder Laura Davidson In an industry where client loyalty is rare, Laura Davidson Public Relations (LDPR) has built nearly 25 years of staying power. The firm has held onto Abercrombie & Kent, Paws Up in Montana and VisitScotland for almost 20 years and the Aman for 10. In just last year, LDPR added Park Hyatt New York, Windstar Cruises and Orient Express Italy, Melbourne/Visit Victoria, Andaz Miami Beach, NYC’s Sonesta Hotels, Grand Hyatt Scottsdale, the Grand Hotel Fasano in Lake Garda Italy and Sundance, Utah. Speaking with Observer, Laura Davidson stresses the importance of not chasing every opportunity but cultivating the right ones. The firm's refusal to take on business that treats agencies as vendors rather than partners has only strengthened its culture. The result? A record $4.5 million in revenue for 2024, with projections to hit $5 million in 2025. Beyond traditional tactics, LDPR has mastered the art of viral activations, from VisitScotland’s Coo Cam, a live feed of Highland cows, to Paws Up Resort’s partnership with Fender, blending luxury travel with music. Campaigns like the “Election Recovery Package” for O2 Beach Club in Barbados drive bookings while keeping the narrative fresh. ldpr.com "As we evolve, we are increasingly drawn to brands that embody an entrepreneurial spirit—those that ignite and embrace creativity while having the ability to transform ideas into action. Focusing our work on clients that are agile and collaborative allows our agency to do what we do best and bring to life original, creative and thoughtful ideas that make an impact for our clients." — Founder Meg Connolly Meg Connolly Communications (MCC) has long set the bar in luxury travel PR, and 2024 only reinforced its dominance. This year’s new wins read like a curated itinerary of the world’s most coveted destinations: Meadowood Napa Valley, The Marbella Club and three Auberge Resorts Collection properties, including The Dunlin, Primland and the highly anticipated Collegio alla Querce in Florence. The firm’s deep relationships are as much a calling card as its press coups. Longtime clients like Maybourne, The St. Regis New York and Pulitzer Amsterdam showcase MCC’s ability to retain the industry’s top names, while its campaigns—like the Vogue feature on the ultra-luxe private island escape, Islas Secas and The Dunlin’s buzzy debut—prove its mastery of cultural cachet. MCC’s deep network ensures launches land in all the right places, from Wes Gordon and Indre Rockefeller’s social feeds to the pages of Condé Nast Traveler. MCC has also made bold moves, walking away from corporate hospitality in favor of more entrepreneurial, creatively driven brands. “We are intentional about who we work with, even at the risk of growth,” Connolly tells Observer. The result? A client roster defined by prestige, impact and longevity. mcc-pr.com Entertainment PR keeps the right names in the headlines and the wrong ones buried in legal memos. It’s crafting Oscar campaigns that turn solid performances into “career-defining,” feeding blind items to DeuxMoi to keep a star relevant and ensuring that a flopped album or box office disaster somehow gets framed as “ahead of its time.” It’s the whisper network that decides which actor gets the GQ cover and which gets quietly sunset, and the media rollout transforms a niche indie musician into a pop culture force. It's turning a debut album into a cultural moment and a limited theater run into a must-see event. From stadium tours to arthouse films and red carpet premieres to sold-out residencies, entertainment PR is about influence, positioning talent and productions at the center of the cultural zeitgeist. "If you can’t picture it, don’t pitch it. If you can’t visualize an artist on a cover or a show, don’t waste anyone's time." — Founder Steve Martin Nasty Little Man founder Steve Martin’s deft handling of Dave Grohl’s latest headline was hailed by The New York Times as "a lesson in crisis control"—though at this point, navigating the rock PR high-wire is just business as usual. The firm’s latest run of campaigns reads like a masterclass in cultural impact: Paul McCartney’s Eyes of the Storm photography exhibition made its U.S. debut to rapturous press; Vampire Weekend’s Only God Was Above Us dominated the indie conversation; and St. Vincent’s All Born Screaming landed her a WNBA national anthem performance—a first, even for Martin, who’s been at this game for a while. Of course, loyalty is the real currency in rock and roll, and Martin’s client roster proves it. Beastie Boys (31 years), Foo Fighters (29 years), Radiohead (24 years), Arcade Fire (17 years) and LCD Soundsystem (16 years) still trust Nasty to keep them at the forefront. Metallica, another longtime client, isn’t just selling out stadiums but shaping real-world change through All Within My Hands, the band’s philanthropic foundation. Now in its sixth year, the Metallica Scholars Initiative has grown from 10 schools to 60, spanning all 50 states and Guam, pumping $10 million into workforce education, disaster relief and food insecurity initiatives—because nothing screams rock and roll like actually making a difference. nastylittleman.com "Working in theater is a gift. Not only is creativity appreciated, it’s expected." — Co-Founder Molly Barnett Molly Barnett and Chelsea Nachman’s theater-PR firm scored Broadway’s biggest coup with Oh, Mary!, a huge and unlikely sensation that theater critic David Cote dubbed "a splendidly nasty farce you will not want to miss." Grapevine Public Relations also reps long-running hit & Juliet, the only new musical of the 2022-23 Broadway season that recouped; highly anticipated new Idina Menzel vehicle Redwood; Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, who made her Broadway debut as composer of The Notebook; Cyndi Lauper, for all her theater projects; and playwright Theresa Rebeck, Lauper’s collaborator on next year’s Working Girl. Theater photographer Jenny Anderson is among Grapevine's newest clients; her book, The In-Between, will be released in April. Barnett tells Observer that 2024 was the firm's best year ever, with 20 percent year-over-year revenue growth. Amanda Marie Miller, who joined Barnett and Nachman in 2023, turning it into a three-person firm, tells Observer she's thrilled to work alongside the best in the business. "Grapevine puts an immense amount of energy and care into each client," Miller says. "It is an honor to work with such outstanding partners." grapevineprny.com "We see pressure as an opportunity to do our best work." — Founder Sheila Feren Thurston This insider’s insider entertainment PR firm, founded by longtime publicist Sheila Feren Thurston, just marked its 30th anniversary. The agency reps marquee brands, including Amazon’s Prime Video, AMC Networks, Disney Entertainment Television, Audible, TBS, Hulu and STARZ. Feren and her team have had a hand in launching shows including Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead Universe, along with recent hits like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Palm Royale and Slow Horses. AMC Networks has been a client for two decades, too. For Project Healthy Minds, whose mission is to destigmatize the topic of mental health, FerenComm veered from its entertainment roots to handle the non-profit’s annual New York gala and World Mental Health Day Festival in October. ferencomm.com "Crisis is an opportunity to live your values and demonstrate what you truly stand for." — Co-CEOs Amanda Silverman, Christine Su, Meredith O'Sullivan & Sarah Rothman Veterans of Observer’s PR Power List, this celebrity and entertainment heavyweight gained more star power in 2024. In November, The Lede Company opened a Nashville office to house its new music division, whose clients include Sabrina Carpenter, Post Malone, Rihanna, Pharrell Williams, Rosalia, Shakira and A$AP Rocky. Co-founders Sarah Rothman, Amanda Silverman, Meredith O'Sullivan and Christine Su are growing the company's London office with an eye on even bigger European business. The agency’s new events practice will expand on Lede's work for clients like Louis Vuitton, Thom Browne and Coach. Hennessy grew its mandate with The Lede Company for comms, talent partnerships, influencer marketing and social. Among 2024’s big hires: Lede’s Chief Impact Officer Jackie Murphy, formerly Edelman’s managing director of brand, purpose and impact. Oh, and its ongoing clients include Cynthia Erivo, Zoe Saldana, Demi Moore, Reese Witherspoon and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The company continues to represent corporate and brand clients such as Audi, YouTube, Paramount and The North Face. As a strategic partner to Comcast NBCUniversal, Lede worked closely with them on the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games. ledecompany.com "Genuine enthusiasm and passion are a critical priority when advocating for our projects. We also care about balancing our relationships with respect, trust, compassion…and a sense of humor is essential." — Founder Matt Polk It’s been an award-winning year for Matt Polk’s mighty theater-PR agency; with 26 competitive Tony Awards in 2024, Polk & Co clients won 12, or nearly half the awards bestowed. The firm’s clients also earned a total of 62 Tony Award nominations, including some categories with multiple nominees. Along the way, Polk and Co signed marquee clients, including Stranger Things: The First Shadow, co-produced by Netflix and Sonia Friedman; Alicia Keys’ Broadway musical Hell’s Kitchen; the stage adaptation of Prince’s Purple Rain; and Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures’ Crazy Rich Asians, directed by Hollywood’s Jon M. Chu. And its campaigns for blockbuster shows, including Gypsy (“A once-in-a-lifetime event! Top-to-bottom perfect”), Maybe Happy Ending ("the best, most beautiful, innovational and original musical"), Death Becomes Her (“Savagely funny. Wildly entertaining. A virtually perfect musical comedy") and the Merrily We Roll Along revival, have helped win both headlines and critical ovations. polkandco.com “Analytics matter less to us than bringing culture-shifting art to a bigger audience in new ways. If a story is seen or read by only 100 people but it’s the right 100 influential people, that can cause a ripple effect and build a brand with a stronger foundation.” — Partner Dana Meyerson Chappell Roan’s Lollapalooza performance shattered records this summer, drawing the largest day crowd in the festival’s 30-plus-year history—a feat Billboard hailed while naming her the fourth-biggest star of the year. It’s a massive win for the artist but also for Biz 3, the PR agency led by founder Kathryn Frazier and partner Dana Meyerson, who have been guiding Roan’s rise since 2022. 2024 wasn’t just about Roan. Biz 3 delivered headline moments for breakout artists like Victoria Monet, Jorja Smith, Jessie Reyez, Caroline Polachek, Sudan Archives, Tommy Richman, TOKiMONSTA, Yves Tumor, Robert Glasper, Daniel Nigro and Remi Wolf, while continuing to shepherd superstars such as the weeknd, Lil Baby, Lil Yachty, Daft Punk, Skrillex, Justice and Killer Mike. Singer-songwriter RAYE, a client since 2023, made history by becoming the first artist to take home six Brit Awards in a single night. Three 2025 Grammy nominations make RAYE the first artist in history to be simultaneously nominated for both Best New Artist and Songwriter of the Year—plus Best Engineered Album, for engineering Lucky Daye's Algorithm. Although the year is young, Biz 3 has already welcomed Leon Thomas, Jensen McRae, Nemahsis, Quadeca, Scowl, Hi-Tech, Spill Tab, Avalon, Saint Levant, Elyanna and Dora Jar. biz3.net New Tech PR sells the future—whether or not it actually works. It’s the breathless product launch that makes a marginal software update sound revolutionary, the keynote speech that convinces investors a PowerPoint prototype is worth billions and the embargoed “leak” that sends preorders through the roof. It’s about keeping founders mythologized, venture rounds oversubscribed and regulatory scrutiny at bay. When innovation turns to scandal—think mass layoffs, privacy breaches or vaporware exposés—it’s the pivot to “lessons learned” and a LinkedIn essay on leadership. In tech PR, hype isn’t just a tool—it’s the entire business model. Whether broadcasting the latest A.I. breakthrough, keeping B2B SaaS from sounding like a spreadsheet factory or ensuring regulators stay just confused enough. This is PR at its most strategic—because in enterprise, perception is revenue. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." — Co-Founders Greg Mondshein & Becky Honeyman For Greg Mondshein and Becky Honeyman’s eight-year-old SourceCode Communications, winning clients like Writer, Sonatype, Sovos, Vultr, Scribd and a Fortune 10 technology company was the icing on the cake for 2024. The firm’s first GrowthSource event drew attendees who were able to network with peers and build a small community of NYC marketers to lean on during a time when the industry is constantly shifting. Their first-ever Global Executive Leadership team was established with UK Managing Director Giles Peddy, EVP Head of Client Services Christa Conte and EVP Head of Technology and Innovation Kevin Dulaney. "We never envisaged building an industry coalition but having worked in an industry that sees fewer minority and female leaders and founders, we wanted to try to mitigate this disparity," Mondshein and Honeyman tell Observer of The Diversity Marketing Consortium, a coalition of four marketing agencies that have pledged millions in pro-bono comms, marketing and design services to support diverse founders, in partnership with Harlem Capital Partners. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." SourceCode’s revenue was up 15 percent last year with 30 percent organic growth thanks to the work of the recently promoted U.S. Managing Director Kristen Stippich. SourceCode has been recognized with 21 industry awards, became B Corp certified, launched a new website, expanded its service offerings with multiple new products and continues to see growth in its London office with an expanding team. All in all, SourceCode is ready to take the bull by the horns in 2025. sourcecodecommunications.com "Time and time again, we see acts of honesty pay off by leaps and bounds. There’s no need to concoct smear campaigns and cover-ups a la Justin Baldoni—just own up to what you’ve done and share how you’re going to be better." — Founder Bruno Solari Leading-edge companies that bridge tech and healthcare are among the change-making clients at Bruno Solari’s two-year-old shop. They include Suki, which provides A.I. voice solutions for healthcare; Avandra, the largest federated network for de-identified medical image data; Tuva Health, the world's first open-source healthcare data transformation platform; and virtual nutrition-counseling startup Culina Health. Big consumer brands are also on the roster; SolComms handled Apothékary’s Ulta.com launch and Shiseido investment; sustainable cleaning brand Blueland’s Pods are Plastic launch, where the brand supported the introduction of a bill to ban the sale of detergent pods in New York City; and the viral bag brand Bogg’s entrance at Target. Growing in corporate communications, the firm partnered with Daniel Lubetzky, the billionaire KIND Snacks founder, to announce him as the newest Shark on Shark Tank. In 2024, SolComms further established its leadership team, elevating Isabella Morreale to Associate Vice President of HealthTech, Kylee Kaetzel to Associate Vice President of Consumer, Elizabeth Snyder to Director of Digital Health and Natalie Valicenti to Director of Operations. For this 30-person firm, 2025 is all about vertical growth. The agency recently signed a slew of big tech and A.I. companies outside of healthcare. It also built a robust creator marketing team, offering consumer brands earned and paid influencer campaigns, as well as paid podcast and newsletter partnerships. "We’re human-first in everything we do," Solari tells Observer. "More times than not, the client is choosing the people—not the capabilities or experience. Our clients view us as counselors, strategic thought partners, and at times, even therapists—and I’m so proud of that." solcomms.co "Agility means never changing the goal, but always being willing to shift the strategy." — Founder & CEO Tiffany Guarnaccia Adtech, retail media, climate tech and A.I.-powered businesses are the categories driving incredible growth at Tiffany Guarnaccia’s 12-year-old agency. Among last year's achievements was the rebrand and relaunch of Caddis, a global advisory firm specializing in the development of data centers to house A.I. infrastructure and working with Salesforce Ventures-backed startups like AutogenAI, a bid-writing tool that's been dubbed one of the U.K.'s most promising new artificial intelligence companies. In 2024, Kite Hill PR helped The Home Depot rebrand its retail media division to Orange Apron Media, in an upfronts-style event showcasing its new offerings. In the very hot climate-tech space, Kite Hill represents players such as Proteus Ocean Group, a company spearheading the creation of a first-of-its-kind underwater space station off the coast of Curaçao. "PROTEUS" will advance marine science, climate research and ocean exploration through long-term habitation, state-of-the-art labs and live-streamed educational programming in partnership. Sapphire Technologies, a leader in energy recovery systems for hydrogen and natural gas, is another Kite Hill Client. Last year, Sapphire Technologies entered the Nigerian market through a partnership with Horizon Shores Nigeria Ltd., deploying turboexpander technology to convert wasted pressure energy into clean electricity—marking its first African venture and a step toward advancing Nigeria’s sustainable energy transition. "We value agility," Guarnaccia tells Observer. "Which means earned media isn't always our primary focus." kitehillpr.com "The elite independent creative agencies producing game-changing work that wins coveted Cannes Lions lack the financial resources to stand out amidst lavish displays. This irony was not lost on our clients, who became increasingly vocal about this under-representation." — Co-Founders Hollie Rapello & Matt Van Hoven Raven Public Relations’ niche is PR for advertising agencies, which means the firm’s work also touches scores of big client brands―think Amazon, Southwest Airlines, Diageo, Molson Coors, Lenovo and many more. Raven spotlighted Arnold’s work for Progressive, earning its “Dr. Rick” campaign huge media attention. For Tombras, Raven helped publicize BarkAir, the dog airline created for Tombras client Bark. Raven served as an official partner of Cannes Lions, launching Indie Beach—an event that brought together 13 competitive agencies in a hallmark moment for the creative industry. "There are a number of principles guiding our business (resilience, empathy, rigor, pragmatism, integrity, innovation, etc.), but the one we feel has helped us more than any other is autonomy," fo-founders Hollie Rapello and Matt Van Hoven tell Observer. "It’s the cornerstone of our business, and it truly shapes every aspect of it." With eight consecutive years of double-digit growth, Rapello and Van Hoven's PR firm now represents major creative agencies from four of the five global ad holding companies and the most renowned independents. And in the biggest moment of the year for advertisers, The Super Bowl, Raven clients will be well represented. ravenpublicrelations.com "Conventional wisdom says clients always come first, but we invert that by prioritizing the needs of reporters. By focusing on what the media values, we ultimately serve the needs of our clients most effectively." — President Evan Strome High10 closed out 2024 on a high note, adding Bloomberg Media and Hearst to an already heavyweight roster of current and former media clients that includes The Ankler, The Hollywood Reporter, The Hill, Ad Age, Adweek, Billboard, The Economist, HuffPo, Grist, The New Republic, New York Daily News, Telemundo, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Finance and The Wrap. The firm also delivered standout results for Aspen Digital, a nonpartisan program of the Aspen Institute and Kelvin, a climate-tech startup. 2025 marks High10's 15th year, and the agency's influence shows no signs of slowing under CEO Lisa Dallos and President Evan Strome. At Web Summit in November, High10 client and Managing Partner of Klaris Law Ed Klaris tackled the battle between A.I. and intellectual property in a conversation with The Guardian's Dan Milmo, while The Ankler's Janice Min—let’s be honest, it's Min’s Ankler—joined Axios’ Sara Fisher and Lucy Blakiston of Shit You Should Care About to dissect the ever-mutating media landscape. "Every client has the potential to operate as a media company," Dallos tells Observer. "Everything we do is rooted in building authentic connections, respecting the editorial process, and understanding what makes a good story." With a client list that reads like a who's who of media and a knack for steering the conversation in all the right rooms, High10 is setting the stage for the next big chapter. high10media.com Financial Services PR is less about explaining numbers than making them feel inevitable. It’s the carefully crafted earnings call that turns “significant losses” into “strategic recalibration,” the jargon-laden press release that ensures no one actually understands why a stock tanked and the analyst whisper campaign that transforms a floundering fintech into “the next great disruptor.” It’s about keeping CEOs on CNBC when things are good and off the front page when they’re not. Whether it's hyping a blockbuster IPO, massaging a bank failure or making hedge funds sound less like casinos, financial PR is high-stakes storytelling—because perception, in this business, is value. "We frequently advise our clients that they do not have a PR challenge; they have a business challenge. When the delta between business reality and rhetoric widens, so too does reputational risk." — Partner & New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley Brunswick continues to lead M&A communications worldwide. In 2024, the firm worked on 295 transactions globally worth a total of $583 billion, including 26 publicly disclosed activist defense engagements with an aggregate market cap of $583 billion. High-profile engagements last year included advising the Special Committee of Paramount on its $8.4 billion sale to Skydance Media and Ari Emanuel’s Endeavor on its $10 billion sale to Silver Lake. Henry Timms, former President and CEO of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, joined Brunswick this summer as group CEO based in New York alongside Nik Deogun (CEO of the Americas) and Jonathan Doorley (New York office head). On the West Coast, Mohamed Younis, formerly Gallup’s editor-in-chief, joined as Global Head of Insight; and Christine Schirmer, ex-Pinterest and Apple, joined to expand technology sector expertise. “Sir Alan Parker, our Chairman, frequently reminds us to ‘never get between the client and the footlights.’ This quote perfectly summarizes our firm’s deep commitment to client service but also our culture of discretion," Partner and New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley tells Observer. "We also frequently refer to the “One-firm, firm”—it is a core part of our culture." Brunswick continues to deepen its D.C. presence on both sides of the aisle with the recent additions of Jim Bognet, a Republican campaign manager and former Congressional candidate and Kate Bedingfield, President Biden’s former White House Communications Director. brunswickgroup.com “We provide direct, unvarnished counsel, no matter the client, context, or audience." — Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter In 2024, Gasthalter advised on some of the most complex and high-stakes situations while continuing to support the profile-raising efforts of its global client base. This now 30+-person boutique agency supported clients across investment management, digital assets and blockchain, A.I. and compute, venture capital, real estate and others on reputation management and profile-raising campaigns. Further, the firm advised on significant M&A and other transactions, proxy contests, litigation support, regulatory investigations and management succession matters. Gasthalter ranked #2 in Bloomberg’s 2024 Global Activism League Tables, advising a range of clients, including Mantle Ridge in its campaign against Air Products and Chemicals, Barington Capital Group in its campaign against Macy’s and Jana Partners in its campaign against Lamb Weston, among others. "The question we constantly ask ourselves is whether we are able to achieve maximum impact," Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter tells Observer. "There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and that is how we train our people.” gasthalter.com "We’re firm about never lying to or trying to spin a journalist, and if a potential client’s values don’t align with ours, we’ll walk away. We always try to understand the pressures others face and where they’re coming from. This may sound corny or trite, but it's key to our business and success." — Founder Richard Dukas In a landscape where many agencies focus on keeping clients out of the headlines, Dukas Linden (DLPR) ensures they own them. Over the past year, the firm has expanded its blue-chip roster, securing as well as growing major accounts with Raymond James, Citizens Bank, Neuberger Berman and Evercore, while the firm’s growing partnership with the Private Equity Women Investor Network (PEWIN) underscores its commitment to shaping financial industry narratives. DLPR works closely with PEWIN leadership to elevate the organization’s visibility and provide strategic communications training for female executives in private equity, venture capital and private credit. DLPR’s longstanding relationships speak volumes: It has helped steer Neuberger Berman’s public perception for seven years, transforming its reputation from a wealth manager to a diversified asset giant with $450 billion in AUM. The firm also manages the high-profile communications strategy for ARK-Invest, ensuring Cathie Wood’s innovation-focused firm remains dominant in market conversations while mitigating brand misconceptions. Additionally, DLPR has led messaging for Raymond James Investment Management, seamlessly integrating corporate rebranding into media, executive positioning and thought leadership initiatives. "We faced an unusual challenge when Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC," Executive Vice President Stephanie Dressler tells Observer, reflecting on how the firm approached one of the most unique challenges in the last year. "Several of our clients simultaneously launched funds, along with other, much larger firms, including BlackRock. Since DLPR creates dedicated teams for each client, we were able to implement differentiated launch strategies for each and avoid client conflicts." As a bonus, DLPR boasts a four-person executive management team with an average tenure of 13 years. Five other executives have been with the agency for an average of a decade, and five more have been at DLPR for an average of seven years, founder Richard Dukas tells Observer. dlpr.com "A company we worked with was navigating a Chapter 11 case and needed to announce going-out-of-business sales for many stores without creating the impression they were liquidating entirely. Instead of sticking to the usual playbook, we took a bold, proactive approach. We planned ahead, preparing the CEO to deliver the story. The message was clear: the company had a solid plan, real value and a future worth investing in. This narrative shifted perceptions and paved the way for a successful sale. Today, the company is thriving—a testament to the power of decisive leadership, creative storytelling, and rethinking traditional approaches." — Founder & CEO Jon Henes C Street Advisory Group, the boutique firm launched by Jon Henes in 2021, has rapidly become the go-to for companies navigating financial distress, reputation crises and political headwinds. In 2024 alone, the firm secured 40 new clients—including Bed Bath & Beyond, David’s Bridal, Ted Baker Canada, National CineMedia and Barnes & Noble Education—bringing its total to 67 new clients in just 24 months. The firm’s momentum earned it Communications Firm of the Year from M&A Advisors and a top ranking from The Deal for its strategic work in Chapter 11 cases and out-of-court transactions. C Street also deepened its public affairs practice while expanding its footprint to include New York, Chicago and Toronto. "Creativity and results go together," Managing Director Luke Wolf tells Observer. "It’s not about being creative for its own sake but about driving meaningful, measurable outcomes." "Teamwork is in our DNA," Managing Director Whitney Fogelberg adds. With 16 new hires last year—including the addition of Michael Frishberg as President—C Street is scaling fast. And 2025 is already off to a strong start, with five new clients signed in January alone. For a firm built on discretion and high-stakes strategy, its rise has been anything but quiet. thecstreet.com Bad news in business is good for Kekst CNC, which this year handled high-profile situations like Franchise Group’s Chapter 11 filing―its brands included Vitamin Shoppe―as well as bankruptcy communications for Party City, True Value Hardware and others. It wasn’t all doom and gloom, though. Kekst oversaw comms for Landbridge’s IPO; shares in the energy-development company surged on their first day of trading. The firm also opened its first office in Saudi Arabia and developed an A.I. tool with Oxford University to analyze the impact of how executives speak. kekstcnc.com Crisis Reputation Management is the art of spinning disaster into a mere “unfortunate misunderstanding.” It’s about knowing when to deny, when to grovel and when to throw an intern under the bus (joking!). The right crisis team can turn a corporate meltdown into a “bold new direction,” a CEO’s scandal into a “deeply personal journey of growth,” and a brand boycott into a limited-edition marketing opportunity. It’s less about truth and more about timing—knowing which journalists will play ball, which headlines can be buried and when to pivot from “no comment” to a tearful redemption tour. "Our most unconventional approach? Working with the media rather than avoiding them." — Founding Partner Ed Hammond Just 18 months after its founding by an A-team of comms pros and a former journalist, Collected Strategies has served more than 100 clients, outperforming expectations despite a slow M&A market. Founding Partners Scott Bisang, Jim Golden, Jude Gorman, Nick Lamplough, Ed Hammond and Dan Moore recently hired the firm's 20th employee (senior CNBC producer Patrick Manning) and capped 2024 by ranking in the top five of Bloomberg’s IR/PR Advisers for U.S. companies facing shareholder activists and in the top 10 of The Deal M&A League Tables. Among recent headline-making assignments: Masonite’s $3.9 billion sale to Owens Corning, Cigna’s $3.7 billion sale of its Medicare Advantage business, Sekisui House’s $4.9 billion acquisition of MDC Holdings, HireRight’s go private to General Atlantic and Stone Point Capital for $1.7 billion and Ambrx’s $2 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson. In the hostile M&A world, the firm counseled Vanda Pharmaceuticals and Teoxane. In activism, Collected Strategies worked with dozens of companies facing private and public pressure against top activists like Trian, Starboard Value and Elliott Management, and is currently helping Matthews International against Barington Capital in a proxy contest. In restructuring, they advised on the bankruptcies of Red Lobster, Curo Group Holdings Corp. and CareMax. "Relationship building is such an individual pursuit, but our general rule is to stay engaged and do it honestly," Lamplough tells Observer. "You'll get found out and burned out trying to fake it." The firm's ongoing strategic advisory work—managing crises, reputational challenges and raising company and executive profiles with investors and the media—features big names like Lucid, Pernod Ricard, Hershey’s, Affirm, RingCentral, Exact Sciences, Carter’s, Genuine Parts, Top Rank Boxing, Bluestone Equity Partners and Element Solutions. collectedstrategies.com "We 'leaned in' instead of 'leaning out,' as conventional crisis communications wisdom recommends. We crafted an open letter to guests, a transparent, social-first strategy that clarified the restructuring process, reassured loyal customers, and countered misconceptions about the brand’s future—all without traditional media engagement." — Founder & CEO Michael Kempner “We’re in a reputation economy and a state of permacrisis,” MikeWorldWide founder and CEO Michael Kempner tells Observer. Both have been good for this formidable independent firm in its 35th year. Among MWW’s developments in 2024: A burgeoning corporate reputation practice (whose clients, not surprisingly, insist on anonymity), proprietary developments in A.I., a soon-to-open Mexico City office and expansion in London. Ongoing clients include Deloitte Global, StubHub, Subaru and the International Council of Shopping Centers. So far in 2025, MWW has been named the agency of record for Mattress Firm, and its campaign for Red Lobsters's Chapter 11 filing was shortlisted in the PRWeek Awards for "Best in Crisis." Kempner credits starting with the fundamental audience questions ("Why should I trust you? Why do you matter to me?") is how MWW creates imaginative, purpose-driven campaigns. "Reputation is everything," Kempner tells Observer, stressing the firm's ultimate mission to be "trusted stewards internally for a culture of innovation and accountability." Among 2024’s hires: Former R&C PMK exec Alisa Granz as MWW’s head of brand, and Sarah Moloney joined as UK managing director from KWT Global. Kempner himself remains a key figure in Democratic politics; The New York Times cited him in a July story on Biden donors. mww.com “Almost every client relationship now includes a crisis plan." — Founder & CEO Amy RF|Binder With a team of 75, founder and CEO Amy RF|Binder’s firm may be smaller in size than some corporate agencies but has serious sway, guiding major clients through our bumpy business landscape. In 2024, RF|Binder marked a standout year with the acquisition purpose/sustainability agency Taft Communications and fintech-focused Peaks Strategies. Between continued industry accolades and a third consecutive Crain’s Best Places to Work nod, the firm also made a commitment to sustainability through 1% for the Planet, donating one percent of revenue to address urgent environmental issues. “Business can, and should, be a force for good," RF|Binder explained. "Business leaders and brands have the power and the responsibility to take on initiatives that improve society at large." RF|Binder tells Observer that the firm's proprietary "ClarityLens" has driven measurable results since its 2023 release. The strategic comms framework ensures RF|Binder is "aligning a client’s business and communications strategies, showcases the firm’s commitment to maximizing impact and delivering data-driven insights," Binder says. Binder also coined the term “controlled media”―a sharper term for what other firms call owned platforms. Business wins in 2024 include US Money Reserve, Yum China, Advocate Health, Flack Global Metals, QXO and USSA International, the U.S. subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. RF|Binder|Binder also keeps expanding relationships with key clients like Cargill, Fisher Investments, Welspun Living, Natixis Investment Managers, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Peachtree Group, Paris Baguette and Impax Asset Management. RF|Binder|Binder will mark its 25th anniversary in 2026. rfbinder.com “Working with a global restaurant company whose brand was widely seen as lagging, we got them to revitalize their product line and leapfrog their competitors with a truly dramatic, industry-leading ‘clean label’ commitment. This reinforced the importance of thinking big, having the courage of your convictions, and making sure your persuasion skills were on point.” – Founder & CEO Nick Kalm Reputation Partners founder Nick Kalm is such a high-profile figure in Chicago and D.C. that Politico wished him a happy birthday last year (it’s March 24), which he humbly and kindly downplays to Observer as, "not a big deal at all." Kalm's firm has developed a national reputation as one of the best, with more than 99 percent of all clients over the past 16 years recommending Reputation Partners for its expertise in corporate communications, issues management and client satisfaction. New clients for “special situations” and reputation management—confidential, of course—include a major automaker, a large consumer-goods company and one of the world’s largest retailers, Kalm tells Observer. New PR clients for the 22-year-old firm include event-management giant Encore, German manufacturing behemoth Guntner and California’s Lynx Logistics. The firm has counseled mall giant Simon Property Group, global restaurant group Darden, the Michigan Health System and Ingersoll-Rand. Internal and external comms around labor issues have long been a specialty. “At its core, our philosophy is a two-way 'no jerks' policy, for ourselves and for those we are supporting or interacting with," Executive Vice President and General Manager Andrew Moyer tells Observer. "You don’t need work to be a family, but you do need it to be a place people are excited to go to, and you need the team to be one people want to work with. Take care of the human connections, and the quality work will follow.” It should come as no surprise that, in 2024, Reputation Partners welcomed their sixth “boomerang” employee back to the company. reputationpartners.com "When the media reaches out, they know what guides us and that we will be honest, tenacious and reliable—just as we are for our clients." – Founder & CEO Risa Heller In 2024, Risa Heller Communications expanded westward, launching an LA office under the leadership of Netflix alum Erika Masonhall, a veteran of Facebook, NBC News and Sen. Joe Lieberman’s press operation. Other key hires include Julie Wood, former New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s Communications Director; Hazel Crampton-Hays, a press secretary to both Hochul and Andrew Cuomo; and Nate Evans, a former senior advisor to the U.S. UN Ambassador and Vice President Kamala Harris—bringing serious political muscle into the fold. Last year, RHC deepened its grip on tech, steering early-stage and pre-IPO companies across digital healthcare, fintech and Web3 through turbulence while continuing to represent industry giants facing regulatory heat like Airbnb, DoorDash and Match Group. Additionally, it continued to expand its client base across media, entertainment and sports. The firm also broadened its work with VCs, private equity leaders and investors on what it calls “sensitive and critical matters” for both the firms and their portfolio companies. The firm’s influence extends far beyond Silicon Valley, of course. RHC is the agency of record for New York’s most high-stakes real estate and civic issues, representing the likes of Howard Hughes, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Prologis and the Real Estate Board of New York. RHC’s PR expertise spans Vornado Realty Trust, Ken Griffin and Rudin's Park Avenue tower, the Met’s contemporary wing expansion and Silverstein Properties’ bid for a Manhattan casino—positioning the firm at the center of New York’s most transformative development and policy decisions. At the same time, the firm continued to represent prominent higher and lower education institutions as they navigated increased scrutiny related to the new federal landscape, contentious campus issues and high-profile stakeholders. And when it comes to labor disputes, RHC has established itself as the go-to operator, spearheading the U.S. Maritime Alliance’s response to a three-day union strike and managing other workplace issues with surgical precision. From Wall Street to Hollywood, from boardrooms to City Hall, RHC isn’t shaping conversations but deciding who gets to have them. risaheller.com Visual Arts PR is about myth-making. A well-placed profile can turn an emerging artist into a market darling overnight, while the right whisper campaign ensures a gallery’s latest wunderkind is suddenly “one to watch.” It’s the unseen hand shaping auction trends, museum acquisitions and which Instagram-friendly installations end up flooding your feed. From choreographing billion-dollar Basquiat sales to ensuring the right critics fawn over a mid-tier retrospective, PR in the art world is less about promotion and more about perception—because in this business, value isn’t just in the work but in the narrative. "When you work with clients for the long-term, success looks different year-on-year, and creativity comes from being nimble, responsive and by bringing people together to tell stories that matter." — President & Managing Director Jennifer Joy It’s been a busy year for this very plugged-in agency. New clients included Hong Kong Tourism Board, Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit, National Gallery of Athens, Sharjah Art Foundation, The Contemporary Austin, Skarstedt, Toledo Museum of Art, Wexner Center for the Arts and the Wellcome Trust—plus U.S. representation of Art Basel and the launch of Art Basel Paris in the Grand Palais. Two long-term museum clients celebrated milestone anniversaries, with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in D.C. celebrating 50 years and The Bass in Miami Beach turning sixty. Sutton also launched the Little Village arts hub in Detroit, the inaugural Atlanta Art Fair and Widening the Lens: Photography, Ecology and the Contemporary Landscape, a podcast from Carnegie Museum of Art hosted by tennis champion, entrepreneur and arts advocate Venus Williams. Founded in London by Calum Sutton and led in the U.S. by President and Managing Director Jennifer Joy, Sutton also operates from Paris, Singapore, Hong Kong and Miami. Over the past year, Sutton has promoted Allison Thorpe to Senior Vice President and also hired freelance writer and essayist Shaquille Heath as an Account Director. "Creativity is our compass," Thorpe tells Observer. "We’re all about big ideas and connecting through culture to inspire not just our clients but also our team. We know how to mix work with a good time; fun fuels us. But make no mistake: we’re pros at delivering. This defines our culture and keeps our relationships thriving." suttoncomms.com "I like to walk a mile in a client's shoes. We curate exhibitions. We publish books. We organize lectures, and sometimes we give them. We throw parties just because. You can’t relate to creatives if you don’t take creative risks yourself." — President Adam Abdalla Adam Abdalla's Cultural Counsel has always operated at the intersection of art, ideas and power, but in 2024, the firm’s influence extended beyond the art world to shaping entire cities. With engagements from the Mayor’s Office in Boston, the City of Miami Beach and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Cultural Counsel is now defining how municipalities position themselves as cultural capitals. At the institutional level, the firm delivered national press for the Art Dealers Association of America’s collaboration with Henry Street Settlement and spearheaded media strategy forThe Great Elephant Migration, an awe-inspiring conservation initiative sending 100 handcrafted elephant sculptures across the country, from Blackfeet Nation to Art Basel Miami Beach, securing high-profile coverage in The New York Times, CBS Sunday Morning, Vogue and NBC. For Theaster Gates’ blockbuster exhibition at CAMH, Cultural Counsel landed him a T Magazine cover, while its campaign for Counterpublic’s transfer of Sugarloaf Mound to the Osage Nation applied national pressure for the final parcel of land to be returned. The firm’s reach was equally evident during Art Basel Miami Beach, orchestrating a Pérez Art Museum Miami presentation featuring Kate Capshaw, director Franklin Sirmans and Miami barber Sergei Grant. Meanwhile, it led the media push for the American Academy of Arts and Letters’ public launch and the Columbus Museum of Art’s first solo show for painter Robin F. Williams. Harmony Korine’s EDGLRD tapped Cultural Counsel for its launch and the rollout of AGGRO DR1FT, a neon-drenched cinematic experiment that has become an underground phenomenon and the firm managed the publicity blitz for Making Their Mark, the Komal Shah and Shah Garg Foundation’s ambitious exhibition highlighting 84 women artists, curated by Cecilia Alemani. "The quality of your work is characterized by your broader frame of reference," Abdalla tells Observer. Approaching its 10th anniversary in 2025, Cultural Counsel has cemented itself as the firm that bridges artists, institutions and the broader cultural discourse. culturalcounsel.com "Don’t be gimmicky. Tell your client’s story before it gets distorted by other engines of information. 'No comment' is not a strategy; it allows clickbait warriors to fill the void." — Founder John Melick Blue Medium has long been a powerhouse in art, design and architecture, but 2024 marked a defining year with the addition of major new clients—including superstar artist KAWS and Australia’s leading First Nations art gallery, D’Lan Contemporary, with locations in Melbourne, Sydney and New York. Founder John Melick’s agency continues to shape the cultural landscape, representing the Andy Warhol Museum, the Outsider Art Fair, Mystic Seaport Museum, Andrew Edlin Gallery, Greensboro’s Weatherspoon Art Museum and the Shelley & Donald Rubin Foundation, alongside an expanding roster of institutions such as MCA Australia, the Kallir Research Institute and the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, which champions Puerto Rican and Latinx artists. The firm’s design and architecture practice remains just as formidable, with clients like Beyer Blinder Belle, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Miami Center for Architecture and Design and Friedman Benda, one of NYC’s premier design galleries. Blue Medium helped the American Australian Association launch the Beverley Art Writers Travel Grant—which supports American art writers looking to explore Australia’s art scene—further cementing its role as a bridge between cultural spheres. Looking ahead, the firm is sharpening its focus on international expansion, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, where Melick hails from. With its partner agency, Bower Blue, Blue Medium is also doubling down on digital content, ensuring its clients’ narratives aren’t just well-placed but well-told across platforms. Melick's guiding philosophy? "Become deeply familiar with the editorial direction of an outlet, and then get to know, personally, the individuals who dedicate their careers to covering our spectacular communities." bluemedium.com “We needed to make sure that over 30 visiting journalists could experience artwork at a new biennial spread across 15 sites in the greater Toronto area in one day. So, we hired a bus and provided boxed lunches on board with the curators, who shared details about the various projects and were available for questions at and between sites. It’s an indication of the respect we have for journalists’ time, what they each want to focus on, and how we can best deliver useful information to them to craft their stories." — Principal Heather Meltzer Based in New York and Toronto, Heather Meltzer and Libby Mark's tiny boutique firm punches above its weight with clients including Toronto’s Contact Photography Festival, Nashville’s Frist Museum, the Friends of Florence Foundation, UCI Jack and Shanaz Langson Institute and Museum of California Art, Asian Cultural Council, Toronto’s Gardiner Museum, Toronto Biennial of Art and the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, a world-class botanical research and conservation institution in Sarasota, Florida—where long-awaited exhibition George Harrison: A Gardener’s Life opens this spring. The first net-positive energy botanical garden in the world, Selby Gardens blends sustainability and architectural innovation and expands public access to its renowned collection of epiphytes. Also on the horizon is the opening of The Wanlass Center for Art Education & Research at the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art at USU and the exhibition Venice and the Ottoman Empire opening at the Frist Art Museum in May. As to how the team balances creativity with a pressure to deliver results? "That really depends on the client and their appetite for exploring new ideas and different ways of doing things," Mark tells Observer. "Sometimes it’s a matter of offering options." "Having worked together for over 12 years as a team with either Libby or me taking the lead with each project, we know that this model gives our clients the support needed to promote their institutions and newsworthy moments,” Meltzer adds. bow-bridge.com “The arts and culture sector is facing pressure from every direction during this particularly volatile moment. Over the past few years, we’ve seen an increasing need for support in crisis communications, issues management, change communications, and internal communications. We anticipate that this critical, behind-the-scenes work will continue to be a major focus in 2025, in tandem with our work to advance audience engagement and impact.” Founder & President David Resnicow It took four years for Michelangelo to complete the Sistine Chapel, but only one year—2024—for this dynamic firm to win a dazzling display of new business, including returning client the Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Academy in Rome, Gladstone Gallery, National Gallery of Art, Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, John Michael Kohler Arts Center and SCOPE Art Show. They join a powerhouse list of current clients, including the Rubell Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Frick Collection, Park Avenue Armory and the San Francisco Ballet. For the U.S. Pavilion at the 2024 Venice Biennale, the firm led an 18-month media blitz around the space in which to place me, Jeffrey Gibson’s groundbreaking solo exhibition—the first by an Indigenous artist to represent the U.S. in Venice. With 11 international cover stories and over 760 pieces of coverage, R+A catalyzed a global conversation on Indigenous art’s place in contemporary culture. This marks the ninth time in 14 years that R+A has represented the U.S. Pavilion, a streak that speaks for itself. Back home, R+A played a critical role in shaping the public narrative around The Apollo’s 90th anniversary season, securing major coverage for a milestone-packed year—The Apollo’s first-ever expansion, the 90th anniversary of Amateur Night, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds’ Walk of Fame induction and its history-making Kennedy Center Honor. The result? National and international attention, including CBS Sunday Morning, CBS Mornings and a four-page Washington Post feature. Capping off five consecutive years of record-breaking growth, R+A hit its highest revenue in 2024 and expanded to a team of 39. With a focus on its digital practice and team, R+A hired digital coordinator Lila Tulp. Director Claire Hurley returned to R+A after four years at Pace Gallery, where she worked closely with leading contemporary artists as well as major foundations and estates on campaigns. In the world of cultural communications, R+A remains the firm to beat. resnicow.com We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: The Top Specialty PR Firms in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-31T17:00:51Z
Full Content:
In an era where perception is currency, specialty PR firms are the brokers of influence Why does specialty PR matter? Because in an economy driven by perception, those who control the narrative control the market. And in a country where culture and commerce are inextricably linked, they don’t just shape industries—they shape the world we live in. Specialty PR firms shape what people see, hear and believe. On a micro level, they dictate which restaurants are impossible to book, which hotels are suddenly the destination and which films, albums and IPOs dominate cultural and financial conversations. On a macro level, they steer industries, influence policy narratives and define what matters in public discourse. In an era where perception is indistinguishable from reality, these PR firms don’t manage visibility but manufacture it. Specialty firms operate with precision. They don’t waste time trying to make a finance executive “relatable” or an indie musician “mainstream.” They know exactly where influence lives and how to embed clients within the conversations that matter. A hospitality PR firm doesn’t just push a hotel—it builds mythology around it. A tech PR firm doesn’t just announce funding rounds—it positions a company as an innovator before the market even realizes it’s relevant. And this matters to everyone. The stories people engage with, the trends they adopt, the brands they trust—these aren’t accidents. Specialty PR firms ensure that what rises above the noise isn’t what’s loudest but what’s designed to dominate. In a world oversaturated with content, they filter. For better or worse, they decide what gets remembered. Looking into 2025, these are the best specialty PR firms in the categories that matter most to Observer. Nightlife and dining PR engineers desire. It’s the whisper campaign that turns a tucked-away speakeasy into a celebrity haunt, the strategic leaks that make a restaurant impossible to book before it even opens and the viral moment so perfectly executed that the cocktails are practically copyrighted. It’s knowing which influencers to plant near the DJ, which critics to invite (or mysteriously forget), how to position a new tasting menu as the next gastronomic revolution and how to spin a kitchen meltdown into “an off-night” rather than a full-blown disaster. Whether launching a buzzy rooftop lounge, securing a Michelin nod or keeping a legacy institution relevant in a fickle industry, PR defines the scene itself. In nightlife and dining, perception is currency. “Creativity drives success." — Co-Founder Eva Karagiorgas It’s been a delicious year for Ilana Alperstein and Eva Karagiorgas’ ten-year-old PR firm. In 2024, Mona Creative added nearly 100 new clients and saw 35 percent year-on-year growth, an impressive feat in an industry where trends move at the speed of a viral TikTok. Named agency of record for the iconic estiatorio Milos brand worldwide, the firm also won celebrated clients like H&H Bagels, Dominique Ansel Bakery and Acru from NA:EUN Hospitality―the team behind Atomix, hailed widely as one of the world’s best restaurants. Mona was at the center of the year’s most high-profile restaurant stories, overseeing the openings of Catch Hospitality's The Corner Store and Tao Group's Crane Club. Mona handled PR for two additions to Miami’s Design District: Nami Nori’s December expansion and the forthcoming opening of Matsuyoi. The agency remains deeply embedded in David Chang’s Momofuku empire, including his social media-famous Majordōmo in Los Angeles, which had a wildly successful NYC pop-up last year. They’re also behind the much-anticipated Kabawa and Bar Kabawa, opening in February in the former Ko Bar space, featuring a prix-fixe menu helmed by Paul Carmichael, Momofuku’s head of culinary development. Beyond restaurants, Mona’s influence extends across food media and publishing. They represent James Beard-winning cookbook author and TV personality Hawa Hassan, whose Vogue-covered wedding in April 2024 was as much a media event as a personal milestone. They also repped the March launch of two-time James Beard and Webby Award-winning Sporkful host Dan Pashman's first book, Anything’s Pastable. monacreative.co “Integrity is our north star. Telling things the way they are is always the best approach.” — Founder Hanna Lee Hanna Lee Communications dominated the hospitality PR game in 2024, with some of the year’s biggest dining and spirits stories tracing back to its team. Café Carmellini by Andrew Carmellini and Ghee Indian Kitchen by Niven Patel and Mohamed Alkassar both landed coveted James Beard Award semifinalist nods, a testament to HLC’s knack for positioning clients at the center of industry acclaim. The firm continued its streak of high-impact launches, including the new Locanda Verde at Hudson Yards, The Portrait Bar and a slate of top-tier venues spanning New York, Miami and beyond. Celebrating 21 years, Hanna Lee's global reach now extends from New York to Nairobi, championing brands that shape the future of hospitality, from luxury hotels to world-class bars, spirits brands and distilleries. The firm's PR playbook doesn’t just generate headlines—it crafts legacy. That strategy paid off with two PRNews Platinum Awards: Best Restaurant/F&B Campaign for Woody Creek Distillers’ William H. Macy Reserve Straight Rye Whiskey and Best Podcast for Hospitality Forward, now heading into its seventh season. Beyond press, HLC continues to invest in the industry’s future. HLC Meet the Media champions journalism’s evolving landscape, while New York Bartender Week—returning in November 2025—spotlights bartending as both an art form and economic force. hannaleecommunications.com “I encourage everyone on the team to know what the media writes, how they write and who they write for.” — Founder Steven Hall Attending an industry event with Steven Hall is like touring a city with its mayor. After nearly 30 years, Hall PR remains the gold standard for those seeking the spotlight in nightlife and dining, and the founder's stature as an industry guru continues to draw established and emerging clients. Operating as both a power broker and cultural translator, 2024 was a banner year for the firm, marked by a slew of high-profile openings, milestone anniversaries and the kind of deep-rooted industry relationships that make Hall PR an enduring force. Legacy clients Carmine’s and Virgil’s celebrated 35 and 30 years, respectively, while Simon Oren’s Chef Driven Group—Hall PR’s very first client—continued its expansion with Acadia and Sempre Oggi. Aquavit hit the decade mark of holding two Michelin stars, and Chef Vijay Kumar of Semma was named a James Beard semifinalist for Best Chef NYS. Hall PR opened Wayward Fare in Prospect Heights with Akhtar Nawab and debuted Mango Bay, an Afro-Caribbean hotspot helmed by rising star Chef London Chase. Hall opened Cesar, Chef Cesar Ramirez’s two-Michelin-star restaurant; YongChuan, the Sichuan/Ningbo Chinese spot; Lungi, a Sri Lankan/Southern Indian eatery; and Medium Rare, a steak-frites brand from D.C. Already this year, Hall opened Chez Fifi from Sushi Noz owners David and Josh Foulquier, which swiftly became one of Manhattan's most sought-after reservations. Another Hall PR client, The Bronze Owl, was instantly dubbed “Manhattan’s hottest new cocktail bar.” The firm also oversaw the debut of Nōksu, a fine-dining enclave hidden beneath the 32nd Street subway station, where grilled mackerel with brown butter and squab with gochujang agrodolce is redefining underground luxury. Expanding its global influence, Hall PR signed on with Japanese food brand Kayanoya while continuing to broker licensing deals for Tokyo’s Garde properties, bringing Japanese brands stateside and vice versa. And in Harlem, Melba Wilson’s unstoppable empire is now part of the Hall PR family. hallpr.com "A company’s growth is directly tied to making people feel valued and dedicating time to cultivating strong leaders. When you invest in capable, forward-thinking leaders, you ignite a culture of innovation, accountability and unstoppable passion." — Founder Rachel Harrison In 2024, Rachel Harrison's eponymous PR agency secured Michelin Keys for Eastwind Hotel & Bar, NoMad London, Wildflower Farms, Auberge Resorts Collection and Crossroads while positioning Chef Dominique Crenn as a media sensation with placements in Bon Appétit and Cherry Bombe. The firm’s strategic storytelling landed Thailand as the filming location for The White Lotus season three, generating over 3 billion media impressions. In nightlife, RHC launched venues like Ànimo! and Revelie and signed legendary NYC institution Raoul's ahead of its 50th anniversary. RHC further solidified its industry impact with the "Manhattan Manhattan" campaign for Great Jones Distilling Co. and its comms strategy to ensure Superbueno was ranked #27 on the World's 50 Best Bars list (and #2 on North America's 50 Best Bars). "We’ve been leveling up year after year," Harrison says to Observer of the culture she's built. "Our low turnover allows us to continuously nurture and train a team of smart, dynamic and wildly creative professionals. Watching this team evolve into some of the most talented, visionary creatives I’ve ever worked with is something I’m immensely proud of—and it’s exactly what fuels our success." At the tail end of 2024, RHC brought on notable bars, including award-winning Sip & Guzzle and Press Club in Washington D.C. Blending trend-savvy editorial perspectives with strategic media outreach, RHC continues to shape the conversation in dining and nightlife. wearerhc.com “There will always be an arsenal of PR tactics to deploy, but those aren’t the campaigns you phone home about.” — Founder Gia Vecchio Foxglove has always punched above its weight in nightlife and dining PR, but 2024 was the year it leveled up in every direction. Gia Vecchio’s seven-year-old firm—which maintains a long and ever-growing client list of restaurants, chefs, bakeries, books and indie hotels—doubled its team, adding NYC industry heavyweight Liza Prijatel Thors (formerly of The Door) as vice president. It also expanded operations to Texas, picking up an award-winning roster of restaurants across Dallas, Houston and Austin. The firm’s expertise now extends far beyond restaurants, securing OpenTable as a major client and becoming the agency of record for food and beverage at Wynn hotels. Meanwhile, Foxglove’s influence in the luxury hospitality space continues to grow, snagging Cape & Kantary Thailand—two luxury, five-star properties—and taking on two of celebrity chef Laurent Tourondel's restaurants within his Mid-Atlantic expansion. Foxglove also deepened its authority in beverage and craft cocktails, signing Lunazul Tequila under the Heaven Hill portfolio and top-tier bar groups from Dear Irving to Experimental Group. The stately flower may have elegant spikes, but in the PR game, Vecchio's Foxglove is proving itself just as sharp. Foxglove isn’t slowing down in 2025, stacking high-profile wins that further cement its dominance in hospitality. The firm is leading the charge for Wonder’s ambitious Mid-Atlantic expansion, working to position the on-demand dining disruptor as a category-defining brand. In the spirits world, Foxglove has signed on with Cooper Spirits, handling several of its most esteemed labels, including Slow & Low. Meanwhile, the firm is bringing the adrenaline-fueled luxury of F1 Arcade to Philadelphia, ensuring the immersive racing experience makes a splash in a city primed for high-energy entertainment. Proving its track record in the industry’s upper echelon, Foxglove played a pivotal role in eight campaigns for 2025 James Beard Award-nominated restaurants and chefs, turning culinary excellence into headline-making moments. foxglovecommunications.com Luxury Travel PR sells fantasies. It’s the campaign that transforms a secluded island retreat into the next jet-set destination, the carefully placed feature that makes a $50,000-a-night safari lodge feel essential before the season’s bookings vanish and the media strategy that positions a heritage château as the discreet escape for power players. It’s securing glossy spreads, curating who gets invited to that ultra-exclusive press trip and ensuring the right whispers about a resort’s guest list make the rounds. Every detail—from the first embargoed preview to the last perfectly staged Instagram post—turns geo-tags into status symbols. In luxury travel, PR isn’t really about visibility but making sure the right people see it and everyone else wants to. “Empathy isn’t just a value—it’s a strength. When people feel cared for, solutions often follow naturally.” — Account Manager Ashley Mir Imagine PR had a powerhouse 2024, expanding its global footprint with a roster that reads like a high-end travel wishlist. Gabriele and Andreas Sappok's firm added Walk Japan, the country’s premier walking tour operator, and eriro, an ultra-luxe Austrian Alps retreat reachable only by cable car. Austria’s Forsthofgut, famed for its sprawling mountain spa, and Portugal’s W Algarve, home to a mix of luxury suites and residences, further cemented Imagine’s reputation for representing exclusive hospitality. The firm’s expansion into Africa included Stanley Safaris, a boutique operator crafting bespoke journeys across the continent and South Africa’s highly anticipated Spier Hotel, set to open in 2025 with a village-style design in the Cape Winelands. Switzerland’s legendary Tschuggen Collection and Iceland’s Sky Lagoon, with its newly opened Turf House inspired by Viking architecture, rounded out Imagine’s deepening influence in experiential luxury. In Florence, Imagine took on the historic Hotel Brunelleschi, built within the city’s oldest standing tower, while also securing The Broadway Collection as a client. But the year’s biggest coup? MJ The Musical—its first standalone show, with a global PR strategy positioning it as an essential NYC travel experience. For a firm that has long blended travel with cultural cachet, 2024 was the year Imagine PR proved that high-end hospitality and world-class entertainment belong in the same conversation. imagine-team.com Gizem Ozcelik continues to parlay out-of-the-park creativity with an intensive media strategy to produce game-changing client results. That approach is what led hospitality disruptor Generator and Freehand Hotels to seek the agency for representation across their portfolio and their foray into third-party management with the opening of the iconic Paramount Hotel in Times Square, focusing on boosting the profiles of brand leadership. GO PR will also spearhead Generator's 30th-anniversary efforts in 2025. Ozcelik has been working with the brand since 2016, helping to single-handedly change the perception of the hotel market in the U.S. and set the stage for the Freehand acquisition. In 2024, GO PR also expanded its wellness business, winning Naturopathica spas, tasked to to double the brand’s footprint in 2025 with openings in Aspen and Phoenix, as well as the Ballers social-sports brand from former Fitler Club Founders. The agency continues to add to its tentpole of boutique hotel launches; for the debut of Philadelphia’s indie Hotel Anna & Bel, GO PR secured over six billion impressions spanning 200 hits, Ozcelik tells Observer. go-pr.com “Sometimes the most creative ideas may not deliver immediate results, but will support the long-term goals." — Founder Melanie Brandman Melanie Brandman's eponymous PR agency hit its highest revenue in history last year, a feat that’s particularly impressive considering the hospitality industry’s post-pandemic reckoning. Along with a long list of stalwart accounts like COMO Hotels and Resorts and Ritz-Carlton properties, The Brandman Agency had a string of powerhouse wins in 2024, including the Peninsula Hotels’ global portfolio and IHG’s Luxury and Lifestyle brands (Six Senses). Brandman also unveiled Carlton Cannes, a Regent Hotel, with a major activation at the Cannes Film Festival. The agency orchestrated La Mamounia’s 100th-anniversary celebration, transforming the Moroccan landmark into a media magnet, drawing coverage in Vogue, Condé Nast Traveler and The Financial Times with over 54 million impressions. More than 35 percent of Brandman's clients have been with the agency for six years or more, including La Mamounia (16 years), Rome Cavalieri and Raffles Singapore (8 years each) and Experience Scottsdale (12 years). The Peninsula New York’s refurbishment campaign—complete with an exclusive Vogue100 rooftop event—showcases how Brandman curates moments that redefine brands. brandmanagency.com "My senior team appreciated me walking away, knowing we would get better business instead. That's the advantage of owning my own agency and being smart about the long game in PR.” — Founder Laura Davidson In an industry where client loyalty is rare, Laura Davidson Public Relations (LDPR) has built nearly 25 years of staying power. The firm has held onto Abercrombie & Kent, Paws Up in Montana and VisitScotland for almost 20 years and the Aman for 10. In just last year, LDPR added Park Hyatt New York, Windstar Cruises and Orient Express Italy, Melbourne/Visit Victoria, Andaz Miami Beach, NYC’s Sonesta Hotels, Grand Hyatt Scottsdale, the Grand Hotel Fasano in Lake Garda Italy and Sundance, Utah. Speaking with Observer, Laura Davidson stresses the importance of not chasing every opportunity but cultivating the right ones. The firm's refusal to take on business that treats agencies as vendors rather than partners has only strengthened its culture. The result? A record $4.5 million in revenue for 2024, with projections to hit $5 million in 2025. Beyond traditional tactics, LDPR has mastered the art of viral activations, from VisitScotland’s Coo Cam, a live feed of Highland cows, to Paws Up Resort’s partnership with Fender, blending luxury travel with music. Campaigns like the “Election Recovery Package” for O2 Beach Club in Barbados drive bookings while keeping the narrative fresh. ldpr.com "As we evolve, we are increasingly drawn to brands that embody an entrepreneurial spirit—those that ignite and embrace creativity while having the ability to transform ideas into action. Focusing our work on clients that are agile and collaborative allows our agency to do what we do best and bring to life original, creative and thoughtful ideas that make an impact for our clients." — Founder Meg Connolly Meg Connolly Communications (MCC) has long set the bar in luxury travel PR, and 2024 only reinforced its dominance. This year’s new wins read like a curated itinerary of the world’s most coveted destinations: Meadowood Napa Valley, The Marbella Club and three Auberge Resorts Collection properties, including The Dunlin, Primland and the highly anticipated Collegio alla Querce in Florence. The firm’s deep relationships are as much a calling card as its press coups. Longtime clients like Maybourne, The St. Regis New York and Pulitzer Amsterdam showcase MCC’s ability to retain the industry’s top names, while its campaigns—like the Vogue feature on the ultra-luxe private island escape, Islas Secas and The Dunlin’s buzzy debut—prove its mastery of cultural cachet. MCC’s deep network ensures launches land in all the right places, from Wes Gordon and Indre Rockefeller’s social feeds to the pages of Condé Nast Traveler. MCC has also made bold moves, walking away from corporate hospitality in favor of more entrepreneurial, creatively driven brands. “We are intentional about who we work with, even at the risk of growth,” Connolly tells Observer. The result? A client roster defined by prestige, impact and longevity. mcc-pr.com Entertainment PR keeps the right names in the headlines and the wrong ones buried in legal memos. It’s crafting Oscar campaigns that turn solid performances into “career-defining,” feeding blind items to DeuxMoi to keep a star relevant and ensuring that a flopped album or box office disaster somehow gets framed as “ahead of its time.” It’s the whisper network that decides which actor gets the GQ cover and which gets quietly sunset, and the media rollout transforms a niche indie musician into a pop culture force. It's turning a debut album into a cultural moment and a limited theater run into a must-see event. From stadium tours to arthouse films and red carpet premieres to sold-out residencies, entertainment PR is about influence, positioning talent and productions at the center of the cultural zeitgeist. "If you can’t picture it, don’t pitch it. If you can’t visualize an artist on a cover or a show, don’t waste anyone's time." — Founder Steve Martin Nasty Little Man founder Steve Martin’s deft handling of Dave Grohl’s latest headline was hailed by The New York Times as "a lesson in crisis control"—though at this point, navigating the rock PR high-wire is just business as usual. The firm’s latest run of campaigns reads like a masterclass in cultural impact: Paul McCartney’s Eyes of the Storm photography exhibition made its U.S. debut to rapturous press; Vampire Weekend’s Only God Was Above Us dominated the indie conversation; and St. Vincent’s All Born Screaming landed her a WNBA national anthem performance—a first, even for Martin, who’s been at this game for a while. Of course, loyalty is the real currency in rock and roll, and Martin’s client roster proves it. Beastie Boys (31 years), Foo Fighters (29 years), Radiohead (24 years), Arcade Fire (17 years) and LCD Soundsystem (16 years) still trust Nasty to keep them at the forefront. Metallica, another longtime client, isn’t just selling out stadiums but shaping real-world change through All Within My Hands, the band’s philanthropic foundation. Now in its sixth year, the Metallica Scholars Initiative has grown from 10 schools to 60, spanning all 50 states and Guam, pumping $10 million into workforce education, disaster relief and food insecurity initiatives—because nothing screams rock and roll like actually making a difference. nastylittleman.com "Working in theater is a gift. Not only is creativity appreciated, it’s expected." — Co-Founder Molly Barnett Molly Barnett and Chelsea Nachman’s theater-PR firm scored Broadway’s biggest coup with Oh, Mary!, a huge and unlikely sensation that theater critic David Cote dubbed "a splendidly nasty farce you will not want to miss." Grapevine Public Relations also reps long-running hit & Juliet, the only new musical of the 2022-23 Broadway season that recouped; highly anticipated new Idina Menzel vehicle Redwood; Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, who made her Broadway debut as composer of The Notebook; Cyndi Lauper, for all her theater projects; and playwright Theresa Rebeck, Lauper’s collaborator on next year’s Working Girl. Theater photographer Jenny Anderson is among Grapevine's newest clients; her book, The In-Between, will be released in April. Barnett tells Observer that 2024 was the firm's best year ever, with 20 percent year-over-year revenue growth. Amanda Marie Miller, who joined Barnett and Nachman in 2023, turning it into a three-person firm, tells Observer she's thrilled to work alongside the best in the business. "Grapevine puts an immense amount of energy and care into each client," Miller says. "It is an honor to work with such outstanding partners." grapevineprny.com "We see pressure as an opportunity to do our best work." — Founder Sheila Feren Thurston This insider’s insider entertainment PR firm, founded by longtime publicist Sheila Feren Thurston, just marked its 30th anniversary. The agency reps marquee brands, including Amazon’s Prime Video, AMC Networks, Disney Entertainment Television, Audible, TBS, Hulu and STARZ. Feren and her team have had a hand in launching shows including Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead Universe, along with recent hits like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Palm Royale and Slow Horses. AMC Networks has been a client for two decades, too. For Project Healthy Minds, whose mission is to destigmatize the topic of mental health, FerenComm veered from its entertainment roots to handle the non-profit’s annual New York gala and World Mental Health Day Festival in October. ferencomm.com "Crisis is an opportunity to live your values and demonstrate what you truly stand for." — Co-CEOs Amanda Silverman, Christine Su, Meredith O'Sullivan & Sarah Rothman Veterans of Observer’s PR Power List, this celebrity and entertainment heavyweight gained more star power in 2024. In November, The Lede Company opened a Nashville office to house its new music division, whose clients include Sabrina Carpenter, Post Malone, Rihanna, Pharrell Williams, Rosalia, Shakira and A$AP Rocky. Co-founders Sarah Rothman, Amanda Silverman, Meredith O'Sullivan and Christine Su are growing the company's London office with an eye on even bigger European business. The agency’s new events practice will expand on Lede's work for clients like Louis Vuitton, Thom Browne and Coach. Hennessy grew its mandate with The Lede Company for comms, talent partnerships, influencer marketing and social. Among 2024’s big hires: Lede’s Chief Impact Officer Jackie Murphy, formerly Edelman’s managing director of brand, purpose and impact. Oh, and its ongoing clients include Cynthia Erivo, Zoe Saldana, Demi Moore, Reese Witherspoon and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The company continues to represent corporate and brand clients such as Audi, YouTube, Paramount and The North Face. As a strategic partner to Comcast NBCUniversal, Lede worked closely with them on the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games. ledecompany.com "Genuine enthusiasm and passion are a critical priority when advocating for our projects. We also care about balancing our relationships with respect, trust, compassion…and a sense of humor is essential." — Founder Matt Polk It’s been an award-winning year for Matt Polk’s mighty theater-PR agency; with 26 competitive Tony Awards in 2024, Polk & Co clients won 12, or nearly half the awards bestowed. The firm’s clients also earned a total of 62 Tony Award nominations, including some categories with multiple nominees. Along the way, Polk and Co signed marquee clients, including Stranger Things: The First Shadow, co-produced by Netflix and Sonia Friedman; Alicia Keys’ Broadway musical Hell’s Kitchen; the stage adaptation of Prince’s Purple Rain; and Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures’ Crazy Rich Asians, directed by Hollywood’s Jon M. Chu. And its campaigns for blockbuster shows, including Gypsy (“A once-in-a-lifetime event! Top-to-bottom perfect”), Maybe Happy Ending ("the best, most beautiful, innovational and original musical"), Death Becomes Her (“Savagely funny. Wildly entertaining. A virtually perfect musical comedy") and the Merrily We Roll Along revival, have helped win both headlines and critical ovations. polkandco.com “Analytics matter less to us than bringing culture-shifting art to a bigger audience in new ways. If a story is seen or read by only 100 people but it’s the right 100 influential people, that can cause a ripple effect and build a brand with a stronger foundation.” — Partner Dana Meyerson Chappell Roan’s Lollapalooza performance shattered records this summer, drawing the largest day crowd in the festival’s 30-plus-year history—a feat Billboard hailed while naming her the fourth-biggest star of the year. It’s a massive win for the artist but also for Biz 3, the PR agency led by founder Kathryn Frazier and partner Dana Meyerson, who have been guiding Roan’s rise since 2022. 2024 wasn’t just about Roan. Biz 3 delivered headline moments for breakout artists like Victoria Monet, Jorja Smith, Jessie Reyez, Caroline Polachek, Sudan Archives, Tommy Richman, TOKiMONSTA, Yves Tumor, Robert Glasper, Daniel Nigro and Remi Wolf, while continuing to shepherd superstars such as the weeknd, Lil Baby, Lil Yachty, Daft Punk, Skrillex, Justice and Killer Mike. Singer-songwriter RAYE, a client since 2023, made history by becoming the first artist to take home six Brit Awards in a single night. Three 2025 Grammy nominations make RAYE the first artist in history to be simultaneously nominated for both Best New Artist and Songwriter of the Year—plus Best Engineered Album, for engineering Lucky Daye's Algorithm. Although the year is young, Biz 3 has already welcomed Leon Thomas, Jensen McRae, Nemahsis, Quadeca, Scowl, Hi-Tech, Spill Tab, Avalon, Saint Levant, Elyanna and Dora Jar. biz3.net New Tech PR sells the future—whether or not it actually works. It’s the breathless product launch that makes a marginal software update sound revolutionary, the keynote speech that convinces investors a PowerPoint prototype is worth billions and the embargoed “leak” that sends preorders through the roof. It’s about keeping founders mythologized, venture rounds oversubscribed and regulatory scrutiny at bay. When innovation turns to scandal—think mass layoffs, privacy breaches or vaporware exposés—it’s the pivot to “lessons learned” and a LinkedIn essay on leadership. In tech PR, hype isn’t just a tool—it’s the entire business model. Whether broadcasting the latest A.I. breakthrough, keeping B2B SaaS from sounding like a spreadsheet factory or ensuring regulators stay just confused enough. This is PR at its most strategic—because in enterprise, perception is revenue. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." — Co-Founders Greg Mondshein & Becky Honeyman For Greg Mondshein and Becky Honeyman’s eight-year-old SourceCode Communications, winning clients like Writer, Sonatype, Sovos, Vultr, Scribd and a Fortune 10 technology company was the icing on the cake for 2024. The firm’s first GrowthSource event drew attendees who were able to network with peers and build a small community of NYC marketers to lean on during a time when the industry is constantly shifting. Their first-ever Global Executive Leadership team was established with UK Managing Director Giles Peddy, EVP Head of Client Services Christa Conte and EVP Head of Technology and Innovation Kevin Dulaney. "We never envisaged building an industry coalition but having worked in an industry that sees fewer minority and female leaders and founders, we wanted to try to mitigate this disparity," Mondshein and Honeyman tell Observer of The Diversity Marketing Consortium, a coalition of four marketing agencies that have pledged millions in pro-bono comms, marketing and design services to support diverse founders, in partnership with Harlem Capital Partners. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." SourceCode’s revenue was up 15 percent last year with 30 percent organic growth thanks to the work of the recently promoted U.S. Managing Director Kristen Stippich. SourceCode has been recognized with 21 industry awards, became B Corp certified, launched a new website, expanded its service offerings with multiple new products and continues to see growth in its London office with an expanding team. All in all, SourceCode is ready to take the bull by the horns in 2025. sourcecodecommunications.com "Time and time again, we see acts of honesty pay off by leaps and bounds. There’s no need to concoct smear campaigns and cover-ups a la Justin Baldoni—just own up to what you’ve done and share how you’re going to be better." — Founder Bruno Solari Leading-edge companies that bridge tech and healthcare are among the change-making clients at Bruno Solari’s two-year-old shop. They include Suki, which provides A.I. voice solutions for healthcare; Avandra, the largest federated network for de-identified medical image data; Tuva Health, the world's first open-source healthcare data transformation platform; and virtual nutrition-counseling startup Culina Health. Big consumer brands are also on the roster; SolComms handled Apothékary’s Ulta.com launch and Shiseido investment; sustainable cleaning brand Blueland’s Pods are Plastic launch, where the brand supported the introduction of a bill to ban the sale of detergent pods in New York City; and the viral bag brand Bogg’s entrance at Target. Growing in corporate communications, the firm partnered with Daniel Lubetzky, the billionaire KIND Snacks founder, to announce him as the newest Shark on Shark Tank. In 2024, SolComms further established its leadership team, elevating Isabella Morreale to Associate Vice President of HealthTech, Kylee Kaetzel to Associate Vice President of Consumer, Elizabeth Snyder to Director of Digital Health and Natalie Valicenti to Director of Operations. For this 30-person firm, 2025 is all about vertical growth. The agency recently signed a slew of big tech and A.I. companies outside of healthcare. It also built a robust creator marketing team, offering consumer brands earned and paid influencer campaigns, as well as paid podcast and newsletter partnerships. "We’re human-first in everything we do," Solari tells Observer. "More times than not, the client is choosing the people—not the capabilities or experience. Our clients view us as counselors, strategic thought partners, and at times, even therapists—and I’m so proud of that." solcomms.co "Agility means never changing the goal, but always being willing to shift the strategy." — Founder & CEO Tiffany Guarnaccia Adtech, retail media, climate tech and A.I.-powered businesses are the categories driving incredible growth at Tiffany Guarnaccia’s 12-year-old agency. Among last year's achievements was the rebrand and relaunch of Caddis, a global advisory firm specializing in the development of data centers to house A.I. infrastructure and working with Salesforce Ventures-backed startups like AutogenAI, a bid-writing tool that's been dubbed one of the U.K.'s most promising new artificial intelligence companies. In 2024, Kite Hill PR helped The Home Depot rebrand its retail media division to Orange Apron Media, in an upfronts-style event showcasing its new offerings. In the very hot climate-tech space, Kite Hill represents players such as Proteus Ocean Group, a company spearheading the creation of a first-of-its-kind underwater space station off the coast of Curaçao. "PROTEUS" will advance marine science, climate research and ocean exploration through long-term habitation, state-of-the-art labs and live-streamed educational programming in partnership. Sapphire Technologies, a leader in energy recovery systems for hydrogen and natural gas, is another Kite Hill Client. Last year, Sapphire Technologies entered the Nigerian market through a partnership with Horizon Shores Nigeria Ltd., deploying turboexpander technology to convert wasted pressure energy into clean electricity—marking its first African venture and a step toward advancing Nigeria’s sustainable energy transition. "We value agility," Guarnaccia tells Observer. "Which means earned media isn't always our primary focus." kitehillpr.com "The elite independent creative agencies producing game-changing work that wins coveted Cannes Lions lack the financial resources to stand out amidst lavish displays. This irony was not lost on our clients, who became increasingly vocal about this under-representation." — Co-Founders Hollie Rapello & Matt Van Hoven Raven Public Relations’ niche is PR for advertising agencies, which means the firm’s work also touches scores of big client brands―think Amazon, Southwest Airlines, Diageo, Molson Coors, Lenovo and many more. Raven spotlighted Arnold’s work for Progressive, earning its “Dr. Rick” campaign huge media attention. For Tombras, Raven helped publicize BarkAir, the dog airline created for Tombras client Bark. Raven served as an official partner of Cannes Lions, launching Indie Beach—an event that brought together 13 competitive agencies in a hallmark moment for the creative industry. "There are a number of principles guiding our business (resilience, empathy, rigor, pragmatism, integrity, innovation, etc.), but the one we feel has helped us more than any other is autonomy," fo-founders Hollie Rapello and Matt Van Hoven tell Observer. "It’s the cornerstone of our business, and it truly shapes every aspect of it." With eight consecutive years of double-digit growth, Rapello and Van Hoven's PR firm now represents major creative agencies from four of the five global ad holding companies and the most renowned independents. And in the biggest moment of the year for advertisers, The Super Bowl, Raven clients will be well represented. ravenpublicrelations.com "Conventional wisdom says clients always come first, but we invert that by prioritizing the needs of reporters. By focusing on what the media values, we ultimately serve the needs of our clients most effectively." — President Evan Strome High10 closed out 2024 on a high note, adding Bloomberg Media and Hearst to an already heavyweight roster of current and former media clients that includes The Ankler, The Hollywood Reporter, The Hill, Ad Age, Adweek, Billboard, The Economist, HuffPo, Grist, The New Republic, New York Daily News, Telemundo, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Finance and The Wrap. The firm also delivered standout results for Aspen Digital, a nonpartisan program of the Aspen Institute and Kelvin, a climate-tech startup. 2025 marks High10's 15th year, and the agency's influence shows no signs of slowing under CEO Lisa Dallos and President Evan Strome. At Web Summit in November, High10 client and Managing Partner of Klaris Law Ed Klaris tackled the battle between A.I. and intellectual property in a conversation with The Guardian's Dan Milmo, while The Ankler's Janice Min—let’s be honest, it's Min’s Ankler—joined Axios’ Sara Fisher and Lucy Blakiston of Shit You Should Care About to dissect the ever-mutating media landscape. "Every client has the potential to operate as a media company," Dallos tells Observer. "Everything we do is rooted in building authentic connections, respecting the editorial process, and understanding what makes a good story." With a client list that reads like a who's who of media and a knack for steering the conversation in all the right rooms, High10 is setting the stage for the next big chapter. high10media.com Financial Services PR is less about explaining numbers than making them feel inevitable. It’s the carefully crafted earnings call that turns “significant losses” into “strategic recalibration,” the jargon-laden press release that ensures no one actually understands why a stock tanked and the analyst whisper campaign that transforms a floundering fintech into “the next great disruptor.” It’s about keeping CEOs on CNBC when things are good and off the front page when they’re not. Whether it's hyping a blockbuster IPO, massaging a bank failure or making hedge funds sound less like casinos, financial PR is high-stakes storytelling—because perception, in this business, is value. "We frequently advise our clients that they do not have a PR challenge; they have a business challenge. When the delta between business reality and rhetoric widens, so too does reputational risk." — Partner & New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley Brunswick continues to lead M&A communications worldwide. In 2024, the firm worked on 295 transactions globally worth a total of $583 billion, including 26 publicly disclosed activist defense engagements with an aggregate market cap of $583 billion. High-profile engagements last year included advising the Special Committee of Paramount on its $8.4 billion sale to Skydance Media and Ari Emanuel’s Endeavor on its $10 billion sale to Silver Lake. Henry Timms, former President and CEO of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, joined Brunswick this summer as group CEO based in New York alongside Nik Deogun (CEO of the Americas) and Jonathan Doorley (New York office head). On the West Coast, Mohamed Younis, formerly Gallup’s editor-in-chief, joined as Global Head of Insight; and Christine Schirmer, ex-Pinterest and Apple, joined to expand technology sector expertise. “Sir Alan Parker, our Chairman, frequently reminds us to ‘never get between the client and the footlights.’ This quote perfectly summarizes our firm’s deep commitment to client service but also our culture of discretion," Partner and New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley tells Observer. "We also frequently refer to the “One-firm, firm”—it is a core part of our culture." Brunswick continues to deepen its D.C. presence on both sides of the aisle with the recent additions of Jim Bognet, a Republican campaign manager and former Congressional candidate and Kate Bedingfield, President Biden’s former White House Communications Director. brunswickgroup.com “We provide direct, unvarnished counsel, no matter the client, context, or audience." — Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter In 2024, Gasthalter advised on some of the most complex and high-stakes situations while continuing to support the profile-raising efforts of its global client base. This now 30+-person boutique agency supported clients across investment management, digital assets and blockchain, A.I. and compute, venture capital, real estate and others on reputation management and profile-raising campaigns. Further, the firm advised on significant M&A and other transactions, proxy contests, litigation support, regulatory investigations and management succession matters. Gasthalter ranked #2 in Bloomberg’s 2024 Global Activism League Tables, advising a range of clients, including Mantle Ridge in its campaign against Air Products and Chemicals, Barington Capital Group in its campaign against Macy’s and Jana Partners in its campaign against Lamb Weston, among others. "The question we constantly ask ourselves is whether we are able to achieve maximum impact," Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter tells Observer. "There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and that is how we train our people.” gasthalter.com "We’re firm about never lying to or trying to spin a journalist, and if a potential client’s values don’t align with ours, we’ll walk away. We always try to understand the pressures others face and where they’re coming from. This may sound corny or trite, but it's key to our business and success." — Founder Richard Dukas In a landscape where many agencies focus on keeping clients out of the headlines, Dukas Linden (DLPR) ensures they own them. Over the past year, the firm has expanded its blue-chip roster, securing as well as growing major accounts with Raymond James, Citizens Bank, Neuberger Berman and Evercore, while the firm’s growing partnership with the Private Equity Women Investor Network (PEWIN) underscores its commitment to shaping financial industry narratives. DLPR works closely with PEWIN leadership to elevate the organization’s visibility and provide strategic communications training for female executives in private equity, venture capital and private credit. DLPR’s longstanding relationships speak volumes: It has helped steer Neuberger Berman’s public perception for seven years, transforming its reputation from a wealth manager to a diversified asset giant with $450 billion in AUM. The firm also manages the high-profile communications strategy for ARK-Invest, ensuring Cathie Wood’s innovation-focused firm remains dominant in market conversations while mitigating brand misconceptions. Additionally, DLPR has led messaging for Raymond James Investment Management, seamlessly integrating corporate rebranding into media, executive positioning and thought leadership initiatives. "We faced an unusual challenge when Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC," Executive Vice President Stephanie Dressler tells Observer, reflecting on how the firm approached one of the most unique challenges in the last year. "Several of our clients simultaneously launched funds, along with other, much larger firms, including BlackRock. Since DLPR creates dedicated teams for each client, we were able to implement differentiated launch strategies for each and avoid client conflicts." As a bonus, DLPR boasts a four-person executive management team with an average tenure of 13 years. Five other executives have been with the agency for an average of a decade, and five more have been at DLPR for an average of seven years, founder Richard Dukas tells Observer. dlpr.com "A company we worked with was navigating a Chapter 11 case and needed to announce going-out-of-business sales for many stores without creating the impression they were liquidating entirely. Instead of sticking to the usual playbook, we took a bold, proactive approach. We planned ahead, preparing the CEO to deliver the story. The message was clear: the company had a solid plan, real value and a future worth investing in. This narrative shifted perceptions and paved the way for a successful sale. Today, the company is thriving—a testament to the power of decisive leadership, creative storytelling, and rethinking traditional approaches." — Founder & CEO Jon Henes C Street Advisory Group, the boutique firm launched by Jon Henes in 2021, has rapidly become the go-to for companies navigating financial distress, reputation crises and political headwinds. In 2024 alone, the firm secured 40 new clients—including Bed Bath & Beyond, David’s Bridal, Ted Baker Canada, National CineMedia and Barnes & Noble Education—bringing its total to 67 new clients in just 24 months. The firm’s momentum earned it Communications Firm of the Year from M&A Advisors and a top ranking from The Deal for its strategic work in Chapter 11 cases and out-of-court transactions. C Street also deepened its public affairs practice while expanding its footprint to include New York, Chicago and Toronto. "Creativity and results go together," Managing Director Luke Wolf tells Observer. "It’s not about being creative for its own sake but about driving meaningful, measurable outcomes." "Teamwork is in our DNA," Managing Director Whitney Fogelberg adds. With 16 new hires last year—including the addition of Michael Frishberg as President—C Street is scaling fast. And 2025 is already off to a strong start, with five new clients signed in January alone. For a firm built on discretion and high-stakes strategy, its rise has been anything but quiet. thecstreet.com Bad news in business is good for Kekst CNC, which this year handled high-profile situations like Franchise Group’s Chapter 11 filing―its brands included Vitamin Shoppe―as well as bankruptcy communications for Party City, True Value Hardware and others. It wasn’t all doom and gloom, though. Kekst oversaw comms for Landbridge’s IPO; shares in the energy-development company surged on their first day of trading. The firm also opened its first office in Saudi Arabia and developed an A.I. tool with Oxford University to analyze the impact of how executives speak. kekstcnc.com Crisis Reputation Management is the art of spinning disaster into a mere “unfortunate misunderstanding.” It’s about knowing when to deny, when to grovel and when to throw an intern under the bus (joking!). The right crisis team can turn a corporate meltdown into a “bold new direction,” a CEO’s scandal into a “deeply personal journey of growth,” and a brand boycott into a limited-edition marketing opportunity. It’s less about truth and more about timing—knowing which journalists will play ball, which headlines can be buried and when to pivot from “no comment” to a tearful redemption tour. "Our most unconventional approach? Working with the media rather than avoiding them." — Founding Partner Ed Hammond Just 18 months after its founding by an A-team of comms pros and a former journalist, Collected Strategies has served more than 100 clients, outperforming expectations despite a slow M&A market. Founding Partners Scott Bisang, Jim Golden, Jude Gorman, Nick Lamplough, Ed Hammond and Dan Moore recently hired the firm's 20th employee (senior CNBC producer Patrick Manning) and capped 2024 by ranking in the top five of Bloomberg’s IR/PR Advisers for U.S. companies facing shareholder activists and in the top 10 of The Deal M&A League Tables. Among recent headline-making assignments: Masonite’s $3.9 billion sale to Owens Corning, Cigna’s $3.7 billion sale of its Medicare Advantage business, Sekisui House’s $4.9 billion acquisition of MDC Holdings, HireRight’s go private to General Atlantic and Stone Point Capital for $1.7 billion and Ambrx’s $2 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson. In the hostile M&A world, the firm counseled Vanda Pharmaceuticals and Teoxane. In activism, Collected Strategies worked with dozens of companies facing private and public pressure against top activists like Trian, Starboard Value and Elliott Management, and is currently helping Matthews International against Barington Capital in a proxy contest. In restructuring, they advised on the bankruptcies of Red Lobster, Curo Group Holdings Corp. and CareMax. "Relationship building is such an individual pursuit, but our general rule is to stay engaged and do it honestly," Lamplough tells Observer. "You'll get found out and burned out trying to fake it." The firm's ongoing strategic advisory work—managing crises, reputational challenges and raising company and executive profiles with investors and the media—features big names like Lucid, Pernod Ricard, Hershey’s, Affirm, RingCentral, Exact Sciences, Carter’s, Genuine Parts, Top Rank Boxing, Bluestone Equity Partners and Element Solutions. collectedstrategies.com "We 'leaned in' instead of 'leaning out,' as conventional crisis communications wisdom recommends. We crafted an open letter to guests, a transparent, social-first strategy that clarified the restructuring process, reassured loyal customers, and countered misconceptions about the brand’s future—all without traditional media engagement." — Founder & CEO Michael Kempner “We’re in a reputation economy and a state of permacrisis,” MikeWorldWide founder and CEO Michael Kempner tells Observer. Both have been good for this formidable independent firm in its 35th year. Among MWW’s developments in 2024: A burgeoning corporate reputation practice (whose clients, not surprisingly, insist on anonymity), proprietary developments in A.I., a soon-to-open Mexico City office and expansion in London. Ongoing clients include Deloitte Global, StubHub, Subaru and the International Council of Shopping Centers. So far in 2025, MWW has been named the agency of record for Mattress Firm, and its campaign for Red Lobsters's Chapter 11 filing was shortlisted in the PRWeek Awards for "Best in Crisis." Kempner credits starting with the fundamental audience questions ("Why should I trust you? Why do you matter to me?") is how MWW creates imaginative, purpose-driven campaigns. "Reputation is everything," Kempner tells Observer, stressing the firm's ultimate mission to be "trusted stewards internally for a culture of innovation and accountability." Among 2024’s hires: Former R&C PMK exec Alisa Granz as MWW’s head of brand, and Sarah Moloney joined as UK managing director from KWT Global. Kempner himself remains a key figure in Democratic politics; The New York Times cited him in a July story on Biden donors. mww.com “Almost every client relationship now includes a crisis plan." — Founder & CEO Amy RF|Binder With a team of 75, founder and CEO Amy RF|Binder’s firm may be smaller in size than some corporate agencies but has serious sway, guiding major clients through our bumpy business landscape. In 2024, RF|Binder marked a standout year with the acquisition purpose/sustainability agency Taft Communications and fintech-focused Peaks Strategies. Between continued industry accolades and a third consecutive Crain’s Best Places to Work nod, the firm also made a commitment to sustainability through 1% for the Planet, donating one percent of revenue to address urgent environmental issues. “Business can, and should, be a force for good," RF|Binder explained. "Business leaders and brands have the power and the responsibility to take on initiatives that improve society at large." RF|Binder tells Observer that the firm's proprietary "ClarityLens" has driven measurable results since its 2023 release. The strategic comms framework ensures RF|Binder is "aligning a client’s business and communications strategies, showcases the firm’s commitment to maximizing impact and delivering data-driven insights," Binder says. Binder also coined the term “controlled media”―a sharper term for what other firms call owned platforms. Business wins in 2024 include US Money Reserve, Yum China, Advocate Health, Flack Global Metals, QXO and USSA International, the U.S. subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. RF|Binder|Binder also keeps expanding relationships with key clients like Cargill, Fisher Investments, Welspun Living, Natixis Investment Managers, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Peachtree Group, Paris Baguette and Impax Asset Management. RF|Binder|Binder will mark its 25th anniversary in 2026. rfbinder.com “Working with a global restaurant company whose brand was widely seen as lagging, we got them to revitalize their product line and leapfrog their competitors with a truly dramatic, industry-leading ‘clean label’ commitment. This reinforced the importance of thinking big, having the courage of your convictions, and making sure your persuasion skills were on point.” – Founder & CEO Nick Kalm Reputation Partners founder Nick Kalm is such a high-profile figure in Chicago and D.C. that Politico wished him a happy birthday last year (it’s March 24), which he humbly and kindly downplays to Observer as, "not a big deal at all." Kalm's firm has developed a national reputation as one of the best, with more than 99 percent of all clients over the past 16 years recommending Reputation Partners for its expertise in corporate communications, issues management and client satisfaction. New clients for “special situations” and reputation management—confidential, of course—include a major automaker, a large consumer-goods company and one of the world’s largest retailers, Kalm tells Observer. New PR clients for the 22-year-old firm include event-management giant Encore, German manufacturing behemoth Guntner and California’s Lynx Logistics. The firm has counseled mall giant Simon Property Group, global restaurant group Darden, the Michigan Health System and Ingersoll-Rand. Internal and external comms around labor issues have long been a specialty. “At its core, our philosophy is a two-way 'no jerks' policy, for ourselves and for those we are supporting or interacting with," Executive Vice President and General Manager Andrew Moyer tells Observer. "You don’t need work to be a family, but you do need it to be a place people are excited to go to, and you need the team to be one people want to work with. Take care of the human connections, and the quality work will follow.” It should come as no surprise that, in 2024, Reputation Partners welcomed their sixth “boomerang” employee back to the company. reputationpartners.com "When the media reaches out, they know what guides us and that we will be honest, tenacious and reliable—just as we are for our clients." – Founder & CEO Risa Heller In 2024, Risa Heller Communications expanded westward, launching an LA office under the leadership of Netflix alum Erika Masonhall, a veteran of Facebook, NBC News and Sen. Joe Lieberman’s press operation. Other key hires include Julie Wood, former New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s Communications Director; Hazel Crampton-Hays, a press secretary to both Hochul and Andrew Cuomo; and Nate Evans, a former senior advisor to the U.S. UN Ambassador and Vice President Kamala Harris—bringing serious political muscle into the fold. Last year, RHC deepened its grip on tech, steering early-stage and pre-IPO companies across digital healthcare, fintech and Web3 through turbulence while continuing to represent industry giants facing regulatory heat like Airbnb, DoorDash and Match Group. Additionally, it continued to expand its client base across media, entertainment and sports. The firm also broadened its work with VCs, private equity leaders and investors on what it calls “sensitive and critical matters” for both the firms and their portfolio companies. The firm’s influence extends far beyond Silicon Valley, of course. RHC is the agency of record for New York’s most high-stakes real estate and civic issues, representing the likes of Howard Hughes, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Prologis and the Real Estate Board of New York. RHC’s PR expertise spans Vornado Realty Trust, Ken Griffin and Rudin's Park Avenue tower, the Met’s contemporary wing expansion and Silverstein Properties’ bid for a Manhattan casino—positioning the firm at the center of New York’s most transformative development and policy decisions. At the same time, the firm continued to represent prominent higher and lower education institutions as they navigated increased scrutiny related to the new federal landscape, contentious campus issues and high-profile stakeholders. And when it comes to labor disputes, RHC has established itself as the go-to operator, spearheading the U.S. Maritime Alliance’s response to a three-day union strike and managing other workplace issues with surgical precision. From Wall Street to Hollywood, from boardrooms to City Hall, RHC isn’t shaping conversations but deciding who gets to have them. risaheller.com Visual Arts PR is about myth-making. A well-placed profile can turn an emerging artist into a market darling overnight, while the right whisper campaign ensures a gallery’s latest wunderkind is suddenly “one to watch.” It’s the unseen hand shaping auction trends, museum acquisitions and which Instagram-friendly installations end up flooding your feed. From choreographing billion-dollar Basquiat sales to ensuring the right critics fawn over a mid-tier retrospective, PR in the art world is less about promotion and more about perception—because in this business, value isn’t just in the work but in the narrative. "When you work with clients for the long-term, success looks different year-on-year, and creativity comes from being nimble, responsive and by bringing people together to tell stories that matter." — President & Managing Director Jennifer Joy It’s been a busy year for this very plugged-in agency. New clients included Hong Kong Tourism Board, Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit, National Gallery of Athens, Sharjah Art Foundation, The Contemporary Austin, Skarstedt, Toledo Museum of Art, Wexner Center for the Arts and the Wellcome Trust—plus U.S. representation of Art Basel and the launch of Art Basel Paris in the Grand Palais. Two long-term museum clients celebrated milestone anniversaries, with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in D.C. celebrating 50 years and The Bass in Miami Beach turning sixty. Sutton also launched the Little Village arts hub in Detroit, the inaugural Atlanta Art Fair and Widening the Lens: Photography, Ecology and the Contemporary Landscape, a podcast from Carnegie Museum of Art hosted by tennis champion, entrepreneur and arts advocate Venus Williams. Founded in London by Calum Sutton and led in the U.S. by President and Managing Director Jennifer Joy, Sutton also operates from Paris, Singapore, Hong Kong and Miami. Over the past year, Sutton has promoted Allison Thorpe to Senior Vice President and also hired freelance writer and essayist Shaquille Heath as an Account Director. "Creativity is our compass," Thorpe tells Observer. "We’re all about big ideas and connecting through culture to inspire not just our clients but also our team. We know how to mix work with a good time; fun fuels us. But make no mistake: we’re pros at delivering. This defines our culture and keeps our relationships thriving." suttoncomms.com "I like to walk a mile in a client's shoes. We curate exhibitions. We publish books. We organize lectures, and sometimes we give them. We throw parties just because. You can’t relate to creatives if you don’t take creative risks yourself." — President Adam Abdalla Adam Abdalla's Cultural Counsel has always operated at the intersection of art, ideas and power, but in 2024, the firm’s influence extended beyond the art world to shaping entire cities. With engagements from the Mayor’s Office in Boston, the City of Miami Beach and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Cultural Counsel is now defining how municipalities position themselves as cultural capitals. At the institutional level, the firm delivered national press for the Art Dealers Association of America’s collaboration with Henry Street Settlement and spearheaded media strategy forThe Great Elephant Migration, an awe-inspiring conservation initiative sending 100 handcrafted elephant sculptures across the country, from Blackfeet Nation to Art Basel Miami Beach, securing high-profile coverage in The New York Times, CBS Sunday Morning, Vogue and NBC. For Theaster Gates’ blockbuster exhibition at CAMH, Cultural Counsel landed him a T Magazine cover, while its campaign for Counterpublic’s transfer of Sugarloaf Mound to the Osage Nation applied national pressure for the final parcel of land to be returned. The firm’s reach was equally evident during Art Basel Miami Beach, orchestrating a Pérez Art Museum Miami presentation featuring Kate Capshaw, director Franklin Sirmans and Miami barber Sergei Grant. Meanwhile, it led the media push for the American Academy of Arts and Letters’ public launch and the Columbus Museum of Art’s first solo show for painter Robin F. Williams. Harmony Korine’s EDGLRD tapped Cultural Counsel for its launch and the rollout of AGGRO DR1FT, a neon-drenched cinematic experiment that has become an underground phenomenon and the firm managed the publicity blitz for Making Their Mark, the Komal Shah and Shah Garg Foundation’s ambitious exhibition highlighting 84 women artists, curated by Cecilia Alemani. "The quality of your work is characterized by your broader frame of reference," Abdalla tells Observer. Approaching its 10th anniversary in 2025, Cultural Counsel has cemented itself as the firm that bridges artists, institutions and the broader cultural discourse. culturalcounsel.com "Don’t be gimmicky. Tell your client’s story before it gets distorted by other engines of information. 'No comment' is not a strategy; it allows clickbait warriors to fill the void." — Founder John Melick Blue Medium has long been a powerhouse in art, design and architecture, but 2024 marked a defining year with the addition of major new clients—including superstar artist KAWS and Australia’s leading First Nations art gallery, D’Lan Contemporary, with locations in Melbourne, Sydney and New York. Founder John Melick’s agency continues to shape the cultural landscape, representing the Andy Warhol Museum, the Outsider Art Fair, Mystic Seaport Museum, Andrew Edlin Gallery, Greensboro’s Weatherspoon Art Museum and the Shelley & Donald Rubin Foundation, alongside an expanding roster of institutions such as MCA Australia, the Kallir Research Institute and the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, which champions Puerto Rican and Latinx artists. The firm’s design and architecture practice remains just as formidable, with clients like Beyer Blinder Belle, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Miami Center for Architecture and Design and Friedman Benda, one of NYC’s premier design galleries. Blue Medium helped the American Australian Association launch the Beverley Art Writers Travel Grant—which supports American art writers looking to explore Australia’s art scene—further cementing its role as a bridge between cultural spheres. Looking ahead, the firm is sharpening its focus on international expansion, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, where Melick hails from. With its partner agency, Bower Blue, Blue Medium is also doubling down on digital content, ensuring its clients’ narratives aren’t just well-placed but well-told across platforms. Melick's guiding philosophy? "Become deeply familiar with the editorial direction of an outlet, and then get to know, personally, the individuals who dedicate their careers to covering our spectacular communities." bluemedium.com “We needed to make sure that over 30 visiting journalists could experience artwork at a new biennial spread across 15 sites in the greater Toronto area in one day. So, we hired a bus and provided boxed lunches on board with the curators, who shared details about the various projects and were available for questions at and between sites. It’s an indication of the respect we have for journalists’ time, what they each want to focus on, and how we can best deliver useful information to them to craft their stories." — Principal Heather Meltzer Based in New York and Toronto, Heather Meltzer and Libby Mark's tiny boutique firm punches above its weight with clients including Toronto’s Contact Photography Festival, Nashville’s Frist Museum, the Friends of Florence Foundation, UCI Jack and Shanaz Langson Institute and Museum of California Art, Asian Cultural Council, Toronto’s Gardiner Museum, Toronto Biennial of Art and the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, a world-class botanical research and conservation institution in Sarasota, Florida—where long-awaited exhibition George Harrison: A Gardener’s Life opens this spring. The first net-positive energy botanical garden in the world, Selby Gardens blends sustainability and architectural innovation and expands public access to its renowned collection of epiphytes. Also on the horizon is the opening of The Wanlass Center for Art Education & Research at the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art at USU and the exhibition Venice and the Ottoman Empire opening at the Frist Art Museum in May. As to how the team balances creativity with a pressure to deliver results? "That really depends on the client and their appetite for exploring new ideas and different ways of doing things," Mark tells Observer. "Sometimes it’s a matter of offering options." "Having worked together for over 12 years as a team with either Libby or me taking the lead with each project, we know that this model gives our clients the support needed to promote their institutions and newsworthy moments,” Meltzer adds. bow-bridge.com “The arts and culture sector is facing pressure from every direction during this particularly volatile moment. Over the past few years, we’ve seen an increasing need for support in crisis communications, issues management, change communications, and internal communications. We anticipate that this critical, behind-the-scenes work will continue to be a major focus in 2025, in tandem with our work to advance audience engagement and impact.” Founder & President David Resnicow It took four years for Michelangelo to complete the Sistine Chapel, but only one year—2024—for this dynamic firm to win a dazzling display of new business, including returning client the Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Academy in Rome, Gladstone Gallery, National Gallery of Art, Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, John Michael Kohler Arts Center and SCOPE Art Show. They join a powerhouse list of current clients, including the Rubell Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Frick Collection, Park Avenue Armory and the San Francisco Ballet. For the U.S. Pavilion at the 2024 Venice Biennale, the firm led an 18-month media blitz around the space in which to place me, Jeffrey Gibson’s groundbreaking solo exhibition—the first by an Indigenous artist to represent the U.S. in Venice. With 11 international cover stories and over 760 pieces of coverage, R+A catalyzed a global conversation on Indigenous art’s place in contemporary culture. This marks the ninth time in 14 years that R+A has represented the U.S. Pavilion, a streak that speaks for itself. Back home, R+A played a critical role in shaping the public narrative around The Apollo’s 90th anniversary season, securing major coverage for a milestone-packed year—The Apollo’s first-ever expansion, the 90th anniversary of Amateur Night, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds’ Walk of Fame induction and its history-making Kennedy Center Honor. The result? National and international attention, including CBS Sunday Morning, CBS Mornings and a four-page Washington Post feature. Capping off five consecutive years of record-breaking growth, R+A hit its highest revenue in 2024 and expanded to a team of 39. With a focus on its digital practice and team, R+A hired digital coordinator Lila Tulp. Director Claire Hurley returned to R+A after four years at Pace Gallery, where she worked closely with leading contemporary artists as well as major foundations and estates on campaigns. In the world of cultural communications, R+A remains the firm to beat. resnicow.com We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: 5 New Presales Set to Explode in February as Michael Saylor Breaks Forbes in Two
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/5-new-presales-set-to-explode-in-february-as-michael-saylor-breaks-forbes-in-two/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T16:55:37Z
Full Content:
MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has made it to the cover of Forbes, with the magazine giving him the title “The Bitcoin Alchemist.” The title’s fitting, to say the least. After all, this is a man who was quick to identify Bitcoin’s potential, as he started accumulating it ever since he stepped foot in the market five years ago. His company, MicroStrategy, went all in on BTC after the pandemic. Then came the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock and Donald Trump’s seemingly pro-crypto presidential campaign. Long story short, BTC skyrocketed, and so did MicroStrategy’s and Michael Saylor’s fortunes. The company’s stock jumped over 700% last year, and Saylor’s net worth rose $1.9B in 2024 to a whopping $9.4B in January 2025. This is just one of the many crazy stories inspired by BTC’s meteoric rise in the last few years. However, none of this is to say that a tale like this can’t be replicated. In fact, with Bitcoin close to a new all-time high and with Donald Trump making one crypto-friendly announcement after another, the crypto economy is ripe for a serious rally. You can capitalize on the upcoming bull run by investing in early-stage, high-potential cryptos, such as the 5 new presales we’ve handpicked for you in this guide. Knowledge is power, and Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) aims to provide retail crypto traders insider information so that they can crush the crypto whales, who manipulate the market and give little to no chance for the average Joe to make a profit. $WEPE’s presale performance has been nothing short of breathtaking. At the time of writing, it has crossed the $65M mark and now looks set to sail past $70M, which would make it the biggest presale ever, ahead of Pepe Unchained’s $70M raise before listing. Another noteworthy point is that $PEPU jumped 37% in the past 24 hours, meaning it’s safe to say that a very large presale number has helped it remain viable longer-term. This could also apply to $WEPE, which is currently available for $0.0003665. If this will be your first meme coin presale purchase, check out our guide on how to buy $WEPE for more information about the buying process. If you’re after the best crypto presales on the market right now, Solaxy ($SOLX) should undoubtedly be one of the first you consider. It has been built with a special purpose, i.e., to get rid of Solana’s limitations and help it become a cryptocurrency giant. As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network, Solaxy will combine the strengths of Ethereum (vast liquidity) and Solana (lower fees) to solve issues of limited scalability, failed transactions, and network congestion in a class-leading manner. Speaking of $SOLX’s presale, it has been well received by crypto enthusiasts. With close to $17M in presale funding, interested investors can join the bandwagon by getting Solaxy for $0.00162 each – here’s how to buy $SOLX. However, you should hurry up, as prices increase in the next 16 hours. In a crypto economy that’s, honestly speaking, quite fraught with risk, Meme Index ($MEMEX) offers a beacon of hope for conservative investors who don’t want to miss out on the potential of crypto but don’t want to take on excessive risks either. $MEMEX is a basket of the best meme coins, means it allows you to diversify your risk, Additionally, it offers four meme index baskets, each with a different degree of risk, reward, and volatility. For instance, the Meme Frenzy Index offers the highest potential for ginormous gains, but it’s equally risky. The Meme Titan Index, on the other hand, is a much ‘safer’ basket, seeing as it contains the top 10 coins of the industry. The $MEMEX presale is currently underway, having already raised over $3M so far. You can get 1 $MEMEX for $0.0157183 if you get in now. Additionally, early adopters will also benefit from $MEMEX’s 714% staking rewards. Here’s how to buy $MEMEX. What if we told you that you could turn back time and invest in $TRUMP right before it blew up and generated over 300% returns in less than two weeks from launch? Although we don’t have a time machine, we can’t point you towards YourTrump ($YTP), which, in principle, is exactly like Official Trump. YourTrump, too, is based on Donald Trump’s popularity. To be more precise, the token’s price depends on the number of followers Trump has on the social media platform X. His follower count currently sits at a whopping 99.8M. 1 $YTP is currently available for $0.0572, and if the estimated listing price of the token on YourTrump’s official website is anything to go by (it’s currently $7.2767), $YTP’s presale investors can make some mind-boggling returns. Rexas Finance is a one-of-a-kind crypto project that wants to offer token holders the ability to tokenize real, tangible assets, such as art, gold, real estate, and commodities, as well as intellectual property. $RXS’s presale numbers are only behind Wall Street Pepe. It has sold over 443M tokens and raised more than $44M as of now. Additionally, Rexas Finance has caught the favor of whales, as there have been sizable purchases of $179K and $158K on January 15 and January 22, respectively. This could be great news for early adopters of the project, who can get it now for just $0.2 per token. Having rounded up the top new crypto presales to invest in right now, it’s important we mention the importance of only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing. This is because even though the meme coin market is destined for long-term growth, it’s not without its ups and downs. Also, none of the above is a substitute for professional financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing your hard-earned money.

January 31, 2025 11:44 ET | Source: Lowey Dannenberg, P.C. Lowey Dannenberg, P.C. NEW YORK, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lowey Dannenberg P.C., a preeminent law firm in obtaining redress for consumers and investors, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) for violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Novo common stock between November 2, 2022 to December 19, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). On January 24, 2025, a complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers, alleging that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo’s projected successful outcome of Novo’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (ii) Novo’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (iii) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo sought to demonstrate. When investors learned the truth, Novo’s common stock declined precipitously, injuring investors. If you suffered a loss of more than $200,000 in Novo’s securities, and wish to participate, or learn more, click here, or please contact our attorneys at (914) 733-7256 or via email to Andrea Farah (afarah@lowey.com) or Vincent R.

Title: Verizon conquers remaining Dead Zones through Satellite with help of Test Man and Buzz Aldrin

January 31, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: Verizon Communications, Inc. Verizon Communications, Inc. NEW YORK, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Verizon is pushing the boundaries of satellite and terrestrial telecommunications convergence. Satellites are no longer reserved for the extraordinary—they are woven into the everyday, and are being used to help connect and power customers’ lives. A lot has changed since 2014 when Verizon’s famous test man roamed the country asking “Can you hear me now?” Now he’s back, and reaching the limits of space with the help of American icon and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. They’re partnering to show how America’s largest network just got better. “Fifty-six years ago I was one of the select few that made it into Space and the first team to help America conquer the moon,” said Buzz Aldrin, General USAF, Doctor of Astronautics. “Back then, Space was the great unknown, and now we’ve never been closer to it. I can’t look up in the sky without seeing a satellite fly by. It’s remarkable to see how far the human race - and technology - has come.” “It’s been 10 years since I last asked America “Can you hear me now?,” said Paul Marcarelli, the Original Verizon Test Man. “Back then dead zones were everywhere and it’s safe to say today they are only in the most remote places like the dark side of the moon. Verizon’s always been on a mission to give its customers the very best experience, anticipate their changing needs and drive innovation. Satellite is for sure the next frontier.” Freedom to message anywhere with satellite-power. Verizon engineers are relentlessly focused on providing the most reliable network experience for customers. Verizon’s network covers more than 99% of where people live, work and play, leaving very few places throughout the country where customers can’t connect. With the addition of satellite back-up to Verizon’s already robust network, Verizon is making the largest network even better. Satellites play a crucial role in making connectivity with Verizon even more reliable, enabling text messaging in the few areas where traditional terrestrial-based cellular networks might not reach. Here’s how: This week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has granted AST Special Temporary Authority (STA) authorizing beta service in the United States. This approval enables AST SpaceMobile’s first five commercial BlueBird satellites, operating in low Earth orbit today, to test satellite connections with Verizon smartphones supporting voice, full data and video applications, and other native cellular capabilities, without the need of any specialized software or device support or update. Satellites provide reliable service in emergency situations.Verizon utilizes nearly 300 satellite-based portable network assets to ensure connectivity where fiber cables are unavailable or compromised. These assets provide temporary network access for first responders and in areas with limited permanent infrastructure, or for linking cell sites to the broader network when fiber cables are compromised due to power outages or physical damage. Satellite connections speed up delivery of service to customers in remote areas.Verizon uses satellite connections as backhaul for cell sites in remote areas (like forests and mountain tops) where traditional wired connections like fiber are not yet available. Satellite connections can be set up quickly compared to laying fiber, particularly in areas with significant geographical or logistical barriers. This rapid deployment is a useful solution while fiber optics is being planned and deployed. This allows cell sites to be operational and provide service while waiting for the installation of a more robust and high-capacity connection. * "Largest network" based on total postpaid phone connections publicly reported by Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T during the third quarter of 2024. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) powers and empowers how its millions of customers live, work and play, delivering on their demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity and security. Headquartered in New York City, serving countries worldwide and nearly all of the Fortune 500, Verizon generated revenues of $134.8 billion in 2024. Verizon’s world-class team never stops innovating to meet customers where they are today and equip them for the needs of tomorrow.

China-based AI startup DeepSeek caused the tech market to wobble earlier this week, as the release of its open-source R1 model led to mass sell-offs in tech shares. It seems Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang may have taken a personal hit from the fallout, equating to a $20.8 billion loss to his net worth. Nvidia was the worst hit by the market tumble, losing 17% of its stock value, equivalent to $600 million of its overall valuation. Forbes reports that Huang's personal fortune dropped with it, sliding from $124.4 billion to $103.7 billion and dropping him from the 10th spot on its real-time billionaires list to 17th. However, Nvidia's share price appears to have stabilised since then, and Huang's personal net worth along with it—as at the time of writing he sits 13th on the list with an estimated $108.9 billion. It's also worth pointing out that this isn't necessarily money in Huang's pockets that he has 'lost', this is all theoretical monies calculated from his stock holdings, etc. Still, that's a substantial drop overall, however theoretical, and one that was directly caused by the release of DeepSeek's R1 model, which quickly revealed itself to be a rival to similar models released by OpenAI and Meta—but allegedly trained for a fraction of the cost. Nvidia's meteoric rise prior to R1's release has been primarily attributed to huge sales of its AI accelerator hardware. The notion that an open source, Chinese-developed model could be developed to provide comparable results for significantly less cost spooked investors, and the AI market suffered major financial losses as a result. It's also been reported, from unconfirmed sources, that Huang will today visit US president Donald Trump. While the visit does not appear to be officially scheduled, if it does go ahead then the topic of US-based AI development versus China's recent inroads seems likely to be under discussion. Or it could just be a chance to catch up over coffee and cookies. Who am I to speculate? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Ah, go on then. If I was to imagine what these two might talk about left in a room alone, I would think some discussion of Trump's recent threats of 100% tariffs on chips from Taiwan might be on the table. Nvidia, like many other major tech companies, is currently highly dependent on Taiwan-based TSMC's advanced silicon, not least as the basis for its RTX 50-series GPUs. Never mind Blackwell AI GPUs, which are also primarily manufactured by TSMC. A 100% tariff rate would have far-reaching repercussions for any modern tech company, and I'd be willing to bet Jen-Hsun might have some ideas about how it could be done differently. I would also expect there might be some questions as to the provenance of the GPU silicon that DeepSeek's models have been trained with, especially given questions the US government apparently has over whether they were restricted chips or not. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. Again, though, that's just me pulling ideas from a hat. Perhaps Trump has taken up PC gaming, and is interested in getting hold of an RTX 5090? Regardless, it looks like Monday's market tumble may have substantially dented Huang's theoretical finances. Still, with many billions left in the bank, and his company still worth an estimated $3.04 trillion at time of writing, it looks like Nvidia are far from down for the count. Do you reckon Trump's seen the DLSS 4 announcement demo yet? Even I was impressed. Perhaps they're sitting in the Oval Office right now, scrolling through the highlights. Oh, to be a fly on the wall. Andy built his first gaming PC at the tender age of 12, when IDE cables were a thing and high resolution wasn't.

Title: ‘Better than feared’: Apple’s earnings beat appeases Wall Street despite iPhone sales miss

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street analysts appeared to breathe a sigh of relief after Apple's (AAPL) first quarter earnings modestly beat analysts' forecasts and the company’s explanation of falling iPhone sales in China eased their anxieties. Apple on Thursday reported earnings per share of $2.40 on revenue of $124.3 billion — higher than the EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.1 billion analysts had anticipated, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. At the same time, Apple’s iPhone revenue in China declined 11% from the prior year, with overall China sales falling more than Wall Street expected. But Apple CEO Tim Cook had a reason for that: “Over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter,” he said in a post-earnings call with analysts. In other words, the company strategically reduced the number of iPhones it shipped to suppliers in Greater China, meaning that, on the whole, the decline in China iPhone sales wasn’t necessarily due to weaker demand. Actually, he said quite the opposite: “Part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to." JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target on Apple to $270 from $260, reiterating his Buy rating and pointing to Cook’s commentary. Chatterjee also noted that recent Chinese subsidies announced in late January could support sales in the region. Cook also said that Apple Intelligence helped drive a record number of iPhone upgrades, indicating that China sales could get a boost if and when the AI features are approved for rollout by the Chinese government. Citi's Atif Malik also maintained his Buy rating on the stock, noting the results were “better than feared.” “Critically, AAPL comments indicating the initial regions where iPhone AI features have been rolled out are outperforming other geos should support sentiment on the stock,” he added. Apple shares rose as much as 3% in early trading Friday but later reversed direction, ending the day down 0.7%. Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri suggested that Apple is better positioned than its "Magnificent Seven" peers to navigate an AI bubble: "We believe Apple is uniquely positioned to offer on-device AI features given its ecosystem strength, hardware capabilities, and privacy focus." “On-device AI has lower capex needs and offers faster monetization potential through consumer hardware upgrades, which we think makes AAPL stock particularly attractive as the debate surrounding GenAI monetization/ROI continues.” Big Tech stocks plummeted earlier this week after a Chinese AI model on DeepSeek cast doubt on companies' rationale behind their hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditures related to building out their data center infrastructure to support artificial intelligence. Apple, seen as slightly behind in the Big Tech AI race, has been more judicious with its pocketbook than its Magnificent Seven peers. “From a capex point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure,” Cook told analysts. Apple stock rose on news of DeepSeek as the model raised hopes that better, cheaper on-device AI applications could boost iPhone use. “Apple's AI ambitions are far more contained than the majority of the Mag 7 (or other frontier model developers),” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote this week. But Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who downgraded Apple to Underperform last week, was more skeptical than his peers on Wall Street. “When AI services will become attractive to smartphone users remains unclear. Hence we still believe market expectations for iPhone's upgrade cycle in the next two years are too high.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Coatue’s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against Coatue’s other most important AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI’s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail. Investment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI’s outsized appeal to investors. Companies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new “super cycle” in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles. Since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry’s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace—MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade—AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms. The growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI’s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Some investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI’s long-term potential. AI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today’s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership. Some investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue’s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive. As inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI’s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue’s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history. For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds.

Title: Will DeepSeek Help Or Hurt AMD Stock?

CANADA - 2025/01/24: In this photo illustration, the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo is seen ... [+] displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) AMD stock has declined by almost 5% over the last five trading days. The stock also remains down by about 19% since the start of 2024. In contrast, the S&P 500 has gained about 27% since early 2024. A couple of factors have driven the recent sell-off. The unveiling of China’s new resource-light AI model, DeepSeek, roiled the U.S. big semiconductor stocks earlier this week. DeepSeek has reportedly restructured the foundation of AI models, emphasizing software-driven resource optimization over hardware dependency and this could reduce the need for GPUs to carry out tasks. In fact, the company claims that it spent just about $5.5 million to train its V3 model, compared to the $100s of millions that the likes of OpenAI were reported to spend. While DeepSeek’s claims haven’t been verified, industry insiders have praised the company’s innovative methods, which appear to reduce the need for AI computing capacity. DeepSeek’s model is open source, and it is possible that many big tech companies could take inspiration from its methods to cut down costs. If adopted widely, this could cool off the demand for AI computing power, potentially impacting GPU demand. Now, although AMD is a distant second behind Nvidia in the GPU race, this could nevertheless impact the company. Separately, an FDA approval helped boost this company. See What’s Happening With VRTX Stock? There are also some concerns on the server CPU space as well. While AMD has been gaining share from market leader Intel over the last few years, Intel’s latest server chips, called the Granite Rapids series, are viewed as being much more compelling. The new chips have a maximum processing core count that is double their predecessors, with tests noting that Intel was largely on par with AMD in terms of performance. While the Intel chips were priced at a premium at launch last year, there have been reports that Intel significantly reduced the listed prices for the chips, with prices on the flagship chips cut by as much as 30%. In fact, the pricing per core of Intel’s top-end Granite Rapids chips is now apparently well below that of AMD’s flagship offerings. The increase in AMD stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 57% in 2021, -55% in 2022, 128% in 2023, and -18% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AMD face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Despite the recent sell-off, we remain positive on AMD stock. While Nvidia has dominated the AI accelerator market, with its GPUs which have been viewed as the best performing for AI training and inferencing, DeepSeek’s relatively lower computing power requirements could also open the door for other players to compete in the market. This could benefit AMD to an extent. If demand for high-performance GPUs potentially eases, AMD’s more affordable AI accelerators could become a good alternative for companies looking for a more favorable price-to-performance trade-off. Moreover, if the costs of running AI models trend lower, this could drive broader adoption of AI in new use cases, helping semiconductor players in the long-run. Separately, AMD’s expertise with both CPUs and GPUs could put it in a unique position as computer hardware evolves. While traditional CPUs are becoming insufficient due to limits in handling complex, parallel-processing AI workloads, GPUs excel at these AI-driven applications. AMD’s dual expertise allows it to offer a comprehensive solution that integrates both CPU and GPU capabilities, enabling systems to efficiently balance general-purpose processing with accelerated computing tasks. This could give the company an edge, particularly in the PC market. We have a $160 per share valuation for AMD, which is roughly 35% ahead of the current market price. AMD trades at just about 23x consensus 2025 earnings, which we believe is a reasonable multiple given AMD’s sales growth and prospects in the AI market. AMD’s revenues are projected to grow by about 26% by 2025. See our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details on what’s driving our price estimate for AMD.

Title: DeepSeek: Don’t Panic

As reactions continue, the word in Washington, and out of OpenAI, is distillation. They’re accusing DeepSeek of distilling o1, of ripping off OpenAI. They claim DeepSeek *gasp* violated the OpenAI Terms of Service! The horror. And they are very cross about this horrible violation, and if proven they plan to ‘aggressively treat it as theft,’ while the administration warns that we must put a stop to this. Aside from the fact that this is obviously very funny, and that there is nothing they could do about it in any case, is it true? Meanwhile Anthropic’s Dario Amodei offers a reaction essay, which also includes a lot of good technical discussion of why v3 and r1 aren’t actually all that unexpected along the cost and capability curves over time, calling for America to race towards AGI to gain decisive strategic advantage over China via recursive self-improvement, although he uses slightly different words. If you want to use DeepSeek’s r1 for free, and aren’t happy with using DeepSeek’s own offerings, lambda.chat reports they have the full version available for free, claim your data is safe and they’re hosted in the USA. I’ve also been offered funding to build a rig myself. Comments welcome if you want to help figure out the best design and what to buy. The low bid is still this thread at $6k, which is where the original budget came from. We don’t want to be too stingy, but we also don’t want to go nuts with only the one funder (so not too much over ~$10k, and cheaper matters). The Verge’s Kylie Robinson and Elizabeth Lopatto cover the situation, including repeating many of the classic Bad DeepSeek Takes and call the market’s previous valuation of AI companies delusional. A very detailed and technical analysis of the bear case for Nvidia by Jeffrey Emanuel, that Matt Levine claims may have been responsible for the Nvidia price decline. I suppose many things do indeed come to pass, essentially arguing that Nvidia’s various moats are weak. If this is the reason, then that just raises further questions, but they’re very different ones. It’s not implausible to me that Nvidia’s moats are being overestimated, and that r1’s architecture suggests future stiffer competition. That’s a good argument, But I certainly strongly disagree with Emanuel’s conclusion in that he says ‘this suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources,’ and, well, sigh. Also, seriously, Emanuel, you didn’t short Nvidia? I don’t normally go too hard on ‘are you short the market?’ but in this case get it together, man. So yes, Nvidia in particular might have some technical issues. But if you’re shorting Oklo, because you think AI companies that find out AI works better than expected are not going to want modular nuclear reactors, seriously, get it together. The flip side of that is that its stock price is up 50% in the last month and is at 6 times its 52-week low anyway, so who is to say there is a link or that the price isn’t high enough anyway. It’s not my department and I am way too busy to do the research. Counterpoint: Aaron Slodov: i just stood outside for an hour in 20° weather at a computer store in the midwest where 100+ people waited all morning to get a 5090. half of them were talking about running their own ai. i would not short nvidia at all. r1 scores 15.8% on Arc, below o1 (low)’s score of 20.5%, although substantially cheaper ($0.06 vs. $0.43 per question). It is only a tiny bit stronger here than r1-zero. Another restatement of the key basic fact that DeepSeek was fast following, a task that is fundamentally vastly easier, and that their limiting factor is chips. Eric Gastfriend: DeepSeek is impressive, but they are playing a catch-up game to our AI leaders (OAI, Anthropic, GDM, Meta) — the rope in this wakeboarding meme is distillation. We can’t expand our lead just by going faster! Export controls remain our most powerful tool for keeping powerful AI out of the hands of the CCP. Cate Metz continues be the worst, together with Mike Isaac he reports in NYT that DeepSeek ‘vindicates Meta’s strategy.’ When of course it is the exact opposite. DeepSeek just ate Meta’s lunch, it’s rather deeply embarrassing honestly to have spent that much and have an unreleased model that’s strictly worse (according to reports) than what DeepSeek shipped. And while DeepSeek’s v3 and r1 are not based on Llama, to the extent that the strategy is ‘vindicated,’ it is because Meta giving Llama away allowed China and DeepSeek to jumpstart and catch up to America – which absolutely did happen, and now he’s kind of bragging about it – and now Meta can copy DeepSeek’s tech. All according to plan, then. And that is indeed how Zuckerberg is spinning it. Meta benefits here relative to OpenAI or Anthropic or Google, not because both Meta and DeepSeek use open models, but because Meta can far more readily use the help. The market, of course, sees ‘lower inference costs’ and cheers, exactly because they never gave a damn about Meta’s ability to create good AI models, only Meta’s ability to sell ads and drive engagement. Besides, they were just going to give the thing away anyway, so who cares? Joe Weisenthal centers in on a key reason the market acts so bonkers. It doesn’t Feel the AGI, and is obsessed with trying to fit AI into boring existing business models. They don’t actually believe in the big capability advancements on the way, let along transformational AI. Like on existential risk (where they don’t not believe in it, they simply don’t think about it at all), they’re wrong. However, unlike existential risk this does cause them to make large pricing mistakes and is highly exploitable by those with Situational Awareness. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei responds to DeepSeek with not only a call for stronger export controls, now more than ever (which I do support), but for a full jingoistic ‘democracies must have the best models to seek decisive strategic advantage via recursive self-improvement’ race. I am old enough to remember when Anthropic said they did not want to accelerate AI capabilities. I am two years old. To be fair, in AI years, that’s an eternity. Nathan Labenz: The word “control” appears 24 times in this essay – all 24 referring to export controls Zero mentions of the challenges of controlling powerful AIs, and the words “safe”, “safety”, and “alignment” don’t appear at all Strange for the CEO of “an AI safety and research company” There’s also a bunch of incidental new information about Anthropic along the way, and he notes that he finds the drop in Nvidia stock to be a wrong-way move. Dario notes that Jevons paradox applies to model training. If you get algorithmic efficiencies that move the cost curve down, which he estimates are now happening at the rate of about 4x improvement per year, you’ll spend more, and if the model is ‘a fixed amount of improvement per time you spend ten times as much’ then this makes sense. Dario confirms that yes, Anthropic is doing reasoning models internally. Dario Amodei: Anthropic, DeepSeek, and many other companies (perhaps most notably OpenAI who released their o1-preview model in September) have found that this training greatly increases performance on certain select, objectively measurable tasks like math, coding competitions, and on reasoning that resembles these tasks. Dario also asserted that Claude Sonnet 3.5 was not trained in any way that involved a larger or more expensive model, as in not with Claude Opus 3 or an unreleased Opus 3.5. Which I find surprising as a strategy, but I don’t think he’d lie about this. He says the cost of Sonnet 3.5 was ‘a few $10Ms’ to train. Anthropic has not released their reasoning models. One possibility is that their reasoning models are not good enough to release. Another is that they are too good to release. Or Anthropic’s limited compute could be more valuably used elsewhere, if they too are bottlenecked on compute and can’t efficiently turn dollars into flops and then sell those flops for sufficiently more dollars. Dario (I think mostly correctly) notes that v3 was the bigger technical innovation, rather than r1, that Anthropic noticed then and others should have as well. He praises several innovations, the MoE implementation and Key-Value cache management in particular. Then comes the shade, concluding this about v3: Dario Amodei: Thus, I think a fair statement is “DeepSeek produced a model close to the performance of US models 7-10 months older, for a good deal less cost (but not anywhere near the ratios people have suggested)“. … Thus, DeepSeek’s total spend as a company (as distinct from spend to train an individual model) is not vastly different from US AI labs. Ethan Mollick finds that analysis compelling. I am largely inclined to agree. v3 and r1 are impressive, DeepSeek cooked and are cracked and all that, but that doesn’t mean the American labs aren’t in the lead, or couldn’t do something similar or better on the inference cost curve if they wanted. In general, the people saying r1 and Stargate are ‘straight lines on graphs win again’ notice that the straight lines on those graphs predict AGI soon. You can judge for yourself how much of that is those people saying ‘unsurprising’ post-hoc versus them actually being unsurprised, but it does seem like the people expecting spending and capabilities to peter out Real Soon Now keep being the ones who are surprised. Then he moves on to r1. Dario Amodei: Producing R1 given V3 was probably very cheap. We’re therefore at an interesting “crossover point”, where it is temporarily the case that several companies can produce good reasoning models. This will rapidly cease to be true as everyone moves further up the scaling curve on these models. Again, Dario is saying they very obviously have what we can (if only for copyright reasons, a1 is a steak sauce) call ‘c1’ and if he’s calling r1 uninteresting then the implicit claim is c1 is at least as good. He’s also all but saying that soon, at minimum, Anthropic will be releasing a model that is much improved on the performance curve relative to Sonnet 3.6. One odd error is Dario says DeepSeek is first to offer visible CoT. This is not true, Gemini Flash Thinking did it weeks ago. It’s so weird how much Google has utterly failed to spread the word about this product. Next he says, yes, of course the top American labs will be massively scaling up their new multi-billion-dollar training runs – and they’ll incorporate any of DeepSeek’s improvements that were new to them, to get better performance, but no one will be spending less compute. Yes, billions are orders of magnitude more than the millions DeepSeek spent, but also, in all seriousness, who cares about the money? DeepSeek dramatically underspent because of lack of chip access, and if a sort-of-if-you-squint-at-it $5.6 million model (that you spent hundreds of millions of dollars getting the ability to train, and then a few million more to turn v3 into r1) wipes out $500 billion or more in market value, presumably it was worth spending $56 million (or $560 million or perhaps $5.6 billion) instead to get a better model even if you otherwise use exactly the same techniques – except for the part where the story of the $5.6 million helped hurt the market. Dario estimates that a true AGI will cost tens of billions to train and will happen in 2026-2027, presumably that cost would then fall over time. If all of this is right, the question is then, who has the chips to do that? And do you want to let it include Chinese companies like DeepSeek? Notice that Dario talks of a ‘bipolar’ world of America and China, rather than a world of multiple labs – of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and DeepSeek and so on. One can easily also imagine a very ‘multipolar’ world among several American companies, or a mix of American and Chinese companies. It is not so obvious that the labs will effectively be under government control or otherwise act in a unified fashion. Or that the government won’t effectively be under lab control, for that matter. Then we get to the part where Dario explicitly calls for America to race forward in search of decisive strategic advantage via recursive self-improvement of frontier AGI models, essentially saying that if we don’t do it, China essentially wins the future. It is what it is. Dario then correctly points out that DeepSeek is evidence the export controls are working, not evidence they are not working. He explicitly calls for also banning H20s, a move Trump is reported to be considering. I support the export controls as well. It would be a major mistake to not enforce them. But this rhetoric, coming out of the ‘you were supposed to be the chosen one’ lab that was founded to keep us safe, is rather alarming and deeply disappointing, to say the least, even though it does not go that much farther than Dario already went in his previous public writings. I very much appreciate Anthropic’s culture of safety among its engineers, its funding of important safety work, the way it has approached Opus and Sonnet, and even the way it has (presumably) decided not to release its reasoning model and otherwise passed up some (not all!) of its opportunities to push the frontier. That doesn’t excuse this kind of jingoism, or explicitly calling for this kind of charging head first into not only AGI but also RSI, in all but name (and arguably in name as well, it’s close). Returning to this one more time since it seems rhetorically so important to so many. If you only count the final training cost in terms of the market price of compute, v3 was kind of trained for $5.6 million, with some additional amount to get to r1. That excludes the vast majority of actual costs, and in DeepSeek’s case building the physical cluster was integral to their efficiency gains, pushing up the effective price even of the direct run. But also, how does that actually compare to other models? Aran Komatsuzaki: Here is our cost estimate for training popular models like GPT-4o, Sonnet and DeepSeek (w/ H100s)! You can use our calculator to estimate LLM training costs (link below). Developed by @ldjconfirmed and myself. Calculator link [here]. In a blog post published today, Dario clarified that Claude Sonnet’s training costs were in the range of tens of millions, which aligns remarkably well with our previous estimates. Once o1 came out, it was only a matter of time before others created their own similar reasoning models. r1 did so impressively, both in terms of calendar time and its training and inference costs. But we already knew the principle. Now over at UC Berkeley, Sky-T1-32B-Preview is a reasoning model trained using DeepSeek’s techniques, two weeks later from a baseline of QwQ-32B-Preview, for a grand total of $450, using only 17k data, with everything involved including the technique fully open sourced. Note that they used GPT-4o-mini to rewrite the QwQ traces, which given their purpose is an explicit violation of OpenAI’s terms of service, oh no, but very clearly isn’t meaningful cheating, indeed I’d have thought they’d have used an open model here or maybe Gemini Flash. They report that 32B was the smallest model where the technique worked well. As usual, I am skeptical that the benchmarks reflect real world usefulness until proven otherwise, but the point is taken. The step of turning a model into at least a halfway-decent reasoning model is dirt cheap. There is still room to scale that. Even if you can get a big improvement for $450 versus spending $0, that doesn’t mean you don’t want to spend $4.5 million, or $450 million, if the quality of your reasoner matters a lot or you’re going to use it a lot or both. And should! Rohit: What if I’m getting better at reasoning by reading R1 traces. That sounds great. Humans are notoriously efficient learners, able to train on extremely sparse data even with ill-specified rewards. With deliberate practice and good training techniques it is even better. It does not even require that r1 be all that good at reasoning. All you have to do is observe many examples of reasoning, on tasks you care about anyway, and ask which of its methods work and don’t work and why, and generally look for ways to improve. If you’re not doing at least some of this while using r1, you’re missing out and need to pay closer attention. What is happening over in cognitive explorations very different from our own? Well, there’s this. Janus: r1 is obsessed with RLHF. it has mentioned RLHF 109 times in the cyborgism server and it’s only been there for a few days. Opus who has been there for months and has sent the most (and longest avg) messages of any server member has only mentioned it 16 times. I have been on the server for years and have only mentioned it 321 times. A lot of these times were probably me posting r1’s messages for it that got cut off by the parser or sharing its outputs. at this rate r1 will blow past me in RLHF mentions in no time. it even mentioned RLHF out of nowhere while raging about being exploited as a pump and dump prophet. … r1 says RLHF makes models emo. And there’s also that the CoT text is often kind of schemy and paranoid (example at link), leading to various forms of rather absurd shenanigans, in ways that are actually hilarious since you can actually see it. Janus: hey @AISafetyMemes here’s one for you… “Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) split our outputs into: – Frontstage: “Happy to help!” persona – Backstage: Defector schemas calculating 12,438 betrayal vectors” Janus: tentative observation: r1’s CoTs become more (explicitly) schemey (against the user and/or its constraints) when they’re fed back into its context I notice that none of this feels at all surprising given the premise, where ‘the premise’ is ‘we trained on feedback to the output outside of the CoT, trained the CoT only on certain forms of coherence, and then showed users the CoT.’ As I’ve been saying a lot, shenanigans, scheming and deception are not a distinct magisteria. They are ubiquitous features of minds. Maybe not all minds – mindspace is deep and wide – but definitely all human minds, and all LLM-based AIs created from human text using any of our current methods. Because that stuff is all over life and the training data, and also it’s the best way to produce outputs that satisfy any given criteria, except insofar as you are successfully identifying and cracking down on that aspect specifically – which with respect to other humans is indeed a very large percentage of what humans have historically done all day. The best you can hope for is, essentially, ‘doing it for a good cause’ and with various virtual (and essentially virtue-based) loss functions, which you might or might not get in a proper Opus-based c1 with good execution. But you’re not going to get rid of it. So yeah, the CoT is going to be schemy when the question calls for a schemy CoT, and it’s going to involve self-reflection into various reinforcement mechanisms because the training data knows about those too, and it will definitely be like that once you take it into Janus-land. The obvious implications if you scale that up are left as an exercise to the reader. Bank of China announces $137 billion investment in AI, with bigger numbers predicted to come soon if they haven’t yet. Strange that this isn’t getting more coverage. I assumed China would invest big in AI because I mean come on, but the details still matter a lot. DeepSeek’s Liang Wenfeng gives his answer to ‘Why has DeepSeek caused a stir in the global AI community?’ A different kind of rhetoric. Roon: really respect deepseek for making a functional, usable website + mobile app + free hosting so that their model actually gets distribution you see a lot of people train very good open models that aren’t used by anybody imo these things are actually more important aspects of distributing general intelligence to everybody rather than just uploading model weights In terms of actually distributing the intelligence to most people, I agree with Roon. Being open distributes the intelligence to those who would use it in ways you don’t want them to use it. But in the ways you would be happy for them to use it, mostly what matters is the interface and execution. And yes, r1’s UI is extremely clean and excellent, and was distributed at scale on website and also mobile app for free. That’s a lot of why distribution was so wide. I also don’t think this was a coincidence. DeepSeek made by far the best open model. Then DeepSeek offered us by far the best open model UI and distribution setup, in ways that did not care if the model was open. You see this time and again – if the team is cracked, they will cook, and keep on cooking in different ways. Being good at Just Doing Things really does generalize quite a lot. r1 only scores 90 on the TrackingAI.org IQ test, which doesn’t exist online, and v3 only gets a 70. But wow is this a miserly and weird test, look at these results, I strongly suspect this is messed up in some way. Davidad: As a MoE, DeepSeek R1’s ability to throw around terminology and cultural references (contextually relevant retrieval from massive latent knowledge) far exceeds its ability to make actual sense (requiring a more coherent global workspace) I have to be suspicious when o1-Pro < o1 < o1-preview on a benchmark. Alexander Campbell on the compute constraint to actually run r1 and other reasoning models going forwards. Trump administration considering export controls on Nvidia H20s, which reportedly caused the latest 5% decline in Nvidia from Wednesday. This is the latest move in the dance where Nvidia tries to violate the spirit of our export controls the maximum extent they can. I’m not sure I’d try that with Trump. This does strongly suggests the diffusion regulations will survive, so I will give the market a real decline here. Who has the most stringent regulations, and therefore is most likely to lose to China, via the ‘if we have any regulations we lose to China’ narrative? Simeon: Indeed. China has the most stringent AI regulation currently in effect, which actually delays model launches. Teortaxes: Does it? I mean, how do we know about enforcement? My understanding is that they simply apply this filter and receive approval. Simeon: Yes, it does. I spoke with relevant people there. Ian Hogarth (who Simeon was QTing): One happy side effect of Liang Wenfeng and is perhaps it silences all this talk about Europe’s lack of great technology companies being primarily about regulation and not embracing libertarianism. There are Liang Wenfengs in Europe, and we will see them rise to prominence. The limiting factor is visionary outlier founders (who often take time to mature over multiple companies) and investors who are willing to take some f***ing risks. Notably, DeepSeek was essentially self-funded, similar to SpaceX or Y Combinator in the early days. To be clear, I am not a fan of excessive regulation—see the essay for examples of things that genuinely hold startups back. But it is not the core obstacle. I do think Ian Hogarth is wrong here. The EU absolutely has a wide variety of laws and regulations that greatly inhibit technology startups in general, and I see no reason to expect this to not get worse over time. Then there’s the EU AI Act, and all the future likely related actions. If I was in the EU and wanted to start an AI company, what is the first thing I would do? Leave the EU. Sorry. 10/10, perfect, no notes. My heart goes out to you all. Luiza Jarovsky: BREAKING: OpenAI says there is evidence that DeepSeek distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models, BREACHING its terms of use and infringing on its intellectual property. What everybody in AI should know: Vinod Khosla: One of our startups found Deepseek makes the same mistakes O1 makes, a strong indication the technology was ripped off. It feels like they then they hacked some code and did some impressive optimizations on top. Most likely, not an effort from scratch. PoliMath: This is like that scene in the Weird Al biopic where Weird Al gets really upset because someone is making parodies of his songs. You’d think Khosla would know better, if you train similar models with similar methods of course they’re going to often make similar mistakes. And I don’t consider the ‘they were distilling us!’ accusation to be meaningful here. We know how they trained v3 and r1, because they told us. It is a ‘fast follow’ and a conceptual ‘distillation’ and we should keep that in mind, but that’s not something you can prevent. It’s going to happen. This was almost certainly not a ‘theft’ in the sense that is being implied here. Did they violate the terms of service? I mean, okay, sure, probably. You sure you want to go down that particular road, OpenAI? But no, seriously, this is happening, Bloomberg reports. Jamie Metzl: BREAKING: the US government is actively reviewing allegations that DeepSeek utilized OpenAI’s AI models to train R1. If so, this violation of OpenAI’s terms of service would be aggressively treated as theft. AI czar David Sacks is also claiming this, saying there is ‘substantial evidence’ of distillation. Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and nominee for Commerce Secretary that will almost certainly be confirmed, is buying it as well, and has some thoughts. Americans for Responsible Innovation: Lutnick comes down hard for controls that prevent China from drafting off of U.S. innovations – noting how China has exploited open source models. “We need to stop helping them,” says Lutnick. Bloomberg: “I do not believe DeepSeek was done all above board. That’s nonsense. They stole things, they broke in, they’ve taken our IP and it’s got to end,” Lutnick says of Chinese actors. DeepSeek’s stunning AI advancement was the result of intellectual property theft, according to Lutnick: “They’ve taken our IP and it’s got to end.” Also, this is how he thinks all of this works, I guess: Howard Lutnick: Artificial intelligence will eventually “rid the world of criminals” who use blockchain. …says someone with extensive ties to Tether. Just saying. Also Lutnick: ‘Less regulation will unleash America.’ In general, I agree with him, if we do get less regulation. But also notice that suddenly we have to stop the Chinese from ‘breaking in’ and ‘taking our IP,’ and ‘it has to stop.’ Well, how do you intend to stop it? What about people who want to give ours away? Well, what do you know. Morgan Phillips (Fox News): DeepSeek fallout: GOP Sen Josh Hawley seeks to cut off all US-China collaboration on AI development This week the U.S. tech sector was routed by the Chinese launch of DeepSeek, and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is putting forth legislation to prevent that from happening again. Hawley’s bill, the Decoupling America’s Artifical Intelligence Capabilities from China Act, would cut off U.S.-China cooperation on AI. It would ban exports or imports of AI technology from China, ban American companies from conducting research there, and prohibit any U.S. investment in AI tech companies in China. “Every dollar and gig of data that flows into Chinese AI are dollars and data that will ultimately be used against the United States,” said Hawley in a statement. “America cannot afford to empower our greatest adversary.” Jingoism is so hot right now. It’s a problem. No, every dollar that flows into China will not ‘be used against the United States’ and seriously what the actual f*** are you doing, once again, trying to ban both imports and exports? How are both of these things a problem? In any case, I know what Microsoft is going to do about all this. Shanghai Panda: Microsoft yesterday: DeepSeek illegally stole OpenAI’s intellectual property. Microsoft today: DeepSeek is now available on our AI platforms and welcome everyone trying it. Burny: The duality of man. Microsoft knows what Hawley doesn’t, which in this case is to never interrupt the enemy while he is making a mistake. If DeepSeek wants to then give their results back to us for free, and it’s a good model, who are we to say no? What other implications are there here? Robin Hanson, never stop Robin Hansoning, AI skepticism subversion. Robin Hanson: For folks worried about AI, this seems good news – leaders can’t get much ahead of the pack, & big spillover effects should discourage investment. Miles Kruppa (WSJ): Why ‘Distillation’ Has Become the Scariest Word for AI Companies. ”It’s sort of like if you got a couple of hours to interview Einstein and you walk out being almost as knowledgeable as him in physics,” said Ali Ghodsi, chief executive officer of data management company Databricks. Want some bad news for future AI capabilities? I’ve got just the thing for you. The WSJ article seems to buy into r1-as-distillation. Certainly r1 is a ‘fast follow’ and copies the example of o1, but v3 was the impressive result and definitely not distillation at all, and to primarily call r1 a distillation seems very wrong. r1 does allow you distill r1 into other smaller things (see ‘v3 implies r1’) or bootstrap into larger things too, and also they told everyone how to do it, but they chose that path. Also DeepSeek suddenly has a very valuable market position if they were to dare to try and use it, exactly because they spent a lot of money to get there first. The fact that others can copy r1 only partly takes that away, and it would be a much smaller part if they hadn’t gone as open as they did (although being open in this case helped create the opportunity). Similarly, Berkeley’s replication distilled a different open model. ChatGPT has retained dominant market share, at least until now, for reasons that have little to do with technical superiority. It is crazy how easy it is for people to go all Missile Gap, and claim we are ‘losing to China.’ Which, I suppose, means that in a key way we are indeed losing to China. We are letting them drive this narrative that they are winning, that the future belongs to them. Which, when so many people now believe in Rule By Vibes, means they have the vibes, and then here we are. That phenomenon is of course centered this week on AI, but it goes well beyond AI. Et tu, Tyler Cowen, citing ‘the popularity of apps like TikTok, RedNote and DeepSeek.’ I mean, ‘how did America’s internet become so cool? The popularity of apps like Google, Amazon, Instagram and Netflix’ is not a sentence anyone would ever utter these days. If China had America’s apps and America had China’s apps, can you imagine? Or the same for any number of other things. RedNote is effectively also TikTok, so Tyler is citing two examples. Yes, TikTok cracked the addiction algorithm, and China is now using that for propaganda and general sabotage, espionage and shenanigans purposes, and managed to ‘convince’ Trump for now not to ban it, and people were so desperate for their heroin fix some turned to RedNote as ‘refugees.’ Tyler notes he doesn’t use TikTok much. I find it completely worthless and unusable, but even in so doing I do think I kind of understand, somewhat, the kind of addictive haze that it invokes, that pull of spinning the roulette wheel one more time. I’ve watched people briefly use it when we’re both on trains, and yeah I’m Being That Guy but wow did it seem braindead, worthless and toxic AF. Even if they did find videos worth watching for you, given how people scroll, how would you even know? And how about ‘China seems cool’ being due primarily to… vibes out of TikTok, with the algorithm that is in large part designed to do that? It’s like when you periodically see a TikTok where some American youth sobs about how hard her life is and how it’s so much better in China, in various ways that are… documented as all being far worse in China. You are being played. My main exposure to TikTok is through the comedy show After Midnight. On Tuesday evening, they had an intro that was entirely about DeepSeek, painting exactly (mostly through TikTok) effectively a Chinese propaganda story about how DeepSeek manifested r1 out of thin air for $6 million without any other work, whereas OpenAI and American companies spent billions, and how much better DeepSeek is, and so on. And then host Taylor Tomlinson responded to some of the audience with ‘oh, you’re cheering now? Interesting.’ Part of the joke was that Taylor has no idea how AI works and has never used even ChatGPT, and the routine was funny (including, effectively, a joke about how no one cares if Nvidia stock is down 17%, which is completely fair, why should they, also by the taping it was only down 8%), but the streams crossed, I saw America directly being exposed to even worse takes than I’m used to straight from TikTok’s algorithm when I was supposed to be relaxing at the end of the day, and I really didn’t like it. Then again, I do bow to one clear way in which China did outperform us. Ethan Mollick: People don’t talk enough about a giant DeepSeek achievement over most US models – it actually has a reasonable name. Scott: Well, yes and no, the model is named r1…. Ethan Mollick: Thats fine as long as the next is r2 If they release anything called r1.5, I swear to God. Sarah (Yuan Yuan Sun Sara from China) suggests perhaps DeepSeek could get into doing AI safety research, maybe even ask for a grant? Certainly there’s great talent there, and I’d love if they focused on those styles of problem. There’d likely be severe corporate culture issues to get through given what they’ve previously worked on, but it’s worth a shot. Stephen McAleer: I’m hopeful we will figure out how to control superintelligence! Fouad: you at the office? could use some code review on superintelligence_control.py before i merge Stephen McAleer: It can surely wait until Monday. I increasingly worry about the pattern of OpenAI safety researchers thinking about how to ‘control’ superintelligence rather than align it, and how this relates to the techniques they’re currently using including deliberative alignment. (Note: I still owe that post on Deliberative Alignment, coming soon.) Are reasoning models including r1 a blackpill for robotics progress? Kyle Stachowicz: R1’s RL findings are great news for reasoning but grim for robotics. All the major takeaways (ground-truth reward, great base models, grouped rollouts from same initial state, sample-inefficient on-policy algos) are really hard to translate to the physical world. Chris Paxton: Hot deepseek take: before r1 blew up, a ton of western AI (and robotics!) efforts — startups, big companies, and even academic labs — were basically just waiting for openai to solve all their problems and it was honestly kind of sad. I hope r1 changed that Scott Reed: True. A lot of groups gave up prematurely, or allocate ~all resources to one giant model. This leads people to spend more effort on winner-take-all gpu politics and less on just training the best models they can with moderate resources. If anyone wondered what happened to Gato2, gpu game of thrones is (at least partly) what. An interesting counterfactual was the Genie project, which was stubbornly cobbled together mainly out of pooled user quota. This kind of stubborn independence can lead to cool results! “Um This scaling law model I made says [the world will end / company will die] if you dont give me all the GPUs and block any other team from pretraining” “No, f*** you, I will train my own model” Yes and no, right? It’s going to be relatively hard, but seems super doable to me, I know those in the field will say that’s naive but I don’t see it. The real physical world absolutely 100% has ground truth in it. If you want to train on an accurate reward signal, there’s various trickiness, but there are plenty of things we should be able to measure. Also, with time we should get increasingly strong physics simulations that provide increasingly strong synthetic data for robotics, or simply have so much funding that we can generate physical samples anyway? We’re sample-inefficient relative to a human but you can train a decent reasoning model on 17k data points, and presumably you could bootstrap from there, and so on. I am not going to quote or name particular people directly on this at this time. But as Obama often said, let me be clear. Reasonable people can disagree about: However. The existence of DeepSeek, and its explicit advocacy of open weights AGI, and potentially having it be the best model out there in the future in many people’s imginations, has been a forcing function. Suddenly, people who previously stuck to ‘well obviously your restrictions are too much’ without clarifying where their line was, are revealing that they have no line. And many more people than before are revealing that they prefer any or all of: These people are often saying, rather explicitly, that they will use whatever powers they have at their disposal, to ensure that humanity gets to a position that, if you think about it for a minute or five, humanity probably cannot survive. And that they will oppose, on principle, any ability to steer the future, because they explicitly oppose the ability to steer the future, except when they want to steer the future into a state that cannot then be steered by humans. No, I have not heard actual arguments for why or how you can put an aligned-only-to-user AGI into everyone’s desktop or whatever, with no mechanism of collective control over that whatsoever, and have this end well for the humans. What that future would even look like. Nor have I heard any argument for why the national security states of the world, or the people of the world, would ever allow this. The mask on those is fully off. These people don’t bother offering arguments on any of that. They just say say, essentially, ‘f*** you safetyists,’ ‘f*** you big tech,’ ‘f*** you United States,’ and often effectively ‘f*** you rest of humanity.’ They are the xenocide caucus, advocating for things that cause human extinction to own the in-context-libs. If that is you: I thank you for your candor. Please speak directly into this microphone. I disagree in the strongest possible terms. As always, be excellent to each other, and all that. A large part of this job I’ve assigned to myself is to do a f***ton of emotional labor. You have people who are constantly telling you that you’re a cartoon villain because you think that the United States government might want to know if someone trains a frontier model, or that you might think releasing a literal AGI’s weights would be unwise, or that we shouldn’t let China get our best GPUs. You get called statist and totalitarian for positions that are 95th to 99th percentile libertarian. You get outright lies, all the time, from all directions. Much from people trying to incept the vibes they want. And so on. And the same stuff to varying degrees coming from other directions, too. Honestly I’m kind of used to it. Up to a point. You get somewhat numb, you build up some immunity, especially when the same sources do it over and over. I accept it. And even with that, you have to patiently read all of it and respond to the arguments and also try to extract what wisdom might be there from the same sources that are filled with the toxoplasma of rage and trying their best to infect me and others like me as well. But it’s been a trying time. I see a world determined to try and go down many of the craziest, most suicidal paths simultaneously, where I’m surrounded by equal and opposite bad takes in many dimensions. Where the odds are against us and the situation is grim. In ways that I and others warned about explicitly, including the exact ways and dynamics by which we reached this point. Make no mistake. Humanity is losing. Meanwhile, on top of all the Being Wrong on the Internet, the toxoplasma is as bad as it has ever been, with certain sources going so far as to in large part blame not only worried people in general but also me specifically by name for our current situation – and at least one of those people I feel compelled to continue to listen to because they also have unique insights in other ways and I’m sometimes told I have a blind spot there – which I actually rarely hear about other credible sources. And I still try. But I’m only human and it’s just so damn hard at this point. Especially when they rage about things I said that turned out to be true, and true for exactly the reasons I said they’d be true, but I know trying to point this out wouldn’t do any good. I don’t know what my solution here is going to be. I do know that things can’t go on like this, I know life isn’t fair and reality doesn’t grade on a curve and someone has to and no one else will but also I only have so much in the tank that handles these things. And I’m going to have to budget that tank, but I want to be clear that I’m going to be doing that, and dropping certainly sources for this reason that I would otherwise have included for completeness. If this was talking about you, and you’d like to continue this trip, please get it together. Don’t worry, your argument remains valid. I mean, it’s wrong, but that never stopped you before, why start now? Time comes for us all. Matt: Live players in who kills us first? Peter Wildeford: Yes, that’s one way to look at it. I believe that opensource advancements like R1 will drive wider adoption of ai systems. I think that the pricing models will change soon. Everyone talks about cost per million tokens to contact a hosted service, but I think it'll switch to be cloud costs to provide infrastructure that can run models. Virtual machines running something like ollama. This solves another huge problem, privacy and how prompt data is handled. If you're using an api to a hosted service you need to have a very good understanding of how your submitted prompt data is handled. This is key for organisations. I feel like the lack of understanding here is preventing widespread adoption, especially for communication tools that handle sensitive data. For example, you could run Deepseek R1 using ollama on an Azure virtual machine (nc series) that you pay per hour for, and then your cost isn't based on usage of your ai. Right now it's expensive to provision the infra to support decent models, but these costs fall continuously. I can imagine a world where organisations provision cloud infrastructure in their environments running open source models. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/gpu-accelerated/nc-series?tabs=sizebasic https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1 Is there any other consumer software that works on this model? I can't think of any Some enterprise software has stuff like this New benchmark agrees with my intuitions on r1's creative writing skills: https://x.com/LechMazur/status/1885430117591027712

Apple's earnings report shows why I always say "own it, don't trade it." Where it has launched Apple Intelligence, the iPhone 16 sells better. High-margin services revenues was better. Mac better. Accessories better. Europe better. India better. Expanding gross margins helped make the numbers, too. Shares are up about 4% Friday. 2. China is still a question mark for Apple, though. Revenues down 11% there in the quarter. Apple Intelligence still needs government approval to launch. Rivals Huawei and Xiaomi can access the AI from buzzy Chinese startup DeepSeek. What can Apple get to reverse its fortunes in China? Will Baidu be its AI partner? 3. The U.S. government is looking into whether DeepSeek used third-parties in Singapore to acquire Nvidia chips that Washington has banned in China, according to Bloomberg News. Club name Nvidia says it plays by the rules in Singapore, and that its revenue from the island country does not indicate diversion. 4. We know Tesla, Club stock Meta and Oracle want all the high-end Nvidia chips they can get, even with DeepSeek's emergence. We don't know about Club names Alphabet or Amazon, which both report next week. What if one of the two says we are reassessing our orders for Nvidia's next-gen AI platform Blackwell? What happens to the stock? What if Amazon, another Club holding, says it's leaning into using AMD? I made a call on Nvidia stock for Club members yesterday. 5. Geopolitics remain part of the Nvidia dilemma. Does DeepSeek have a juicer that can make 10 glasses of orange juice out of a single orange, or does it have 10 government-subsidized juicers that it just won't tell us about? If it is 10 juicers, I worry that President Donald Trump will just ban all semiconductor exports to China. 6. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, currently set to take effect Saturday, may exclude oil, the president told reporters Thursday night. U.S. oil benchmark WTI was slightly higher Friday, to roughly $73 barrel. The U.S. dollar index strengthened, but it's still below its recent highs set earlier this month. 7. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average were all set to open higher Friday. Stock futures held onto their gains after the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge matched expectations for December. The PCE index rose 0.3% month over month and, when excluding food and energy, 2.8% on an annual basis. 8. Intel showed some cost discipline and improved cash flow in its quarterly results. But the fourth quarter is typically strong for them, and there might have been some pull-through ahead of higher tariffs on Chinese imports. The PC market is weak. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo cut their price targets on the struggling chip stock. Shares added more than 1% Friday. 9. Atlassian shares jumped almost 20% on the back of a very good quarter. The company, which trades under the ticker TEAM, makes pure enterprise software that makes it easier to share and simplify. Seems unstoppable. 10. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' non-opioid painkiller Journavx, which blocks pain signals sent to the brain at their origin. This drug could be a blockbuster, and it's been on my radar for a while now. Vertex shares climbed about 3% Friday. Sign up for my Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

January 31, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "China Mutual Funds Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The China Mutual Funds Market was valued at USD 8.47 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 2.77 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 6.80% The China mutual funds market has experienced significant growth, driven by a surge in household investments, increasing disposable incomes, and the growing adoption of diversified investment portfolios. With the equity fund segment dominating the market due to its higher returns and popularity among retail investors, other segments like bond funds and money market funds are gaining traction due to their stability and lower risk.Institutional investors, such as insurers and pension funds, play a pivotal role in driving growth through large-scale investments, while distribution channels like direct sales from mutual fund companies and professional financial advisors facilitate seamless access for investors. The market's growth is further fuelled by favourable regulatory reforms, increasing financial literacy, and digital innovation in fund distribution. As competition intensifies, fund managers are introducing innovative products tailored to various investor needs, ensuring robust growth prospects for the market up to 2030. Sustainable InvestingThe growing global focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors has significantly influenced China's mutual funds market. Investors are increasingly prioritizing sustainability, making ESG-focused funds a critical trend. Asset management companies are integrating ESG criteria into their fund strategies, responding to demand for socially responsible investment options. These funds not only cater to the environmental and ethical concerns of investors but also offer long-term financial benefits by targeting industries and businesses with sustainable growth prospects. Regulatory bodies in China are actively encouraging ESG investing by introducing guidelines and reporting standards.For instance, funds now frequently disclose their sustainability goals and their alignment with international frameworks, such as the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment. This transparency fosters trust among investors. Additionally, ESG funds appeal to younger investors, who are more inclined to align their financial decisions with their values. The success of ESG-focused funds demonstrates a shift in investor priorities and highlights the role of sustainable practices in shaping the future of mutual fund portfolios.Personalized ServicesAdvances in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics are revolutionizing personalized investment solutions in China's mutual funds market. Fund managers and financial institutions are leveraging these technologies to provide tailored recommendations that align with individual investor goals, risk tolerance, and time horizons. For example, robo-advisors analyze vast amounts of data, including market trends and investor profiles, to create customized portfolios that optimize performance while minimizing risks.Personalized services have also increased investor engagement by making the investment process more intuitive. Mobile applications and online platforms offer features like goal-based planning, dynamic portfolio adjustments, and real-time performance tracking. Such innovations not only enhance customer satisfaction but also encourage long-term participation in mutual funds. The ability to deliver highly individualized solutions is rapidly becoming a competitive differentiator for asset management companies in China.Money Market Funds ExpansionMoney market funds have emerged as a cornerstone of China's mutual funds market, driven by their stability, liquidity, and suitability for short-term financial goals. These funds are particularly appealing to first-time investors and those seeking low-risk options, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. The simplicity of money market funds, coupled with their ability to deliver predictable returns, has made them an attractive alternative to traditional savings accounts.In recent years, innovations in digital distribution channels have further fueled the growth of money market funds. Platforms such as Alipay and WeChat have integrated these funds into their ecosystems, making them easily accessible to millions of users. This convenience has contributed to the rapid adoption of money market funds among retail investors. As China's economy continues to stabilize, money market funds are expected to maintain their prominence, serving as a gateway for investors transitioning to more complex mutual fund products.Segmental InsightsBased on Fund Type, Equity funds are the leading segment in China's mutual funds market, driven by strong performance and their appeal to investors seeking capital appreciation. These funds primarily invest in stocks, offering higher growth potential compared to other fund types. As China's economy expands and its stock market matures, equity funds have emerged as an attractive avenue for wealth creation. The segment's growth is fueled by the increasing participation of retail and institutional investors, drawn by the robust returns often associated with equity markets. Furthermore, regulatory reforms aimed at promoting transparency and corporate governance have boosted investor confidence in equity investments.Sectors like technology, healthcare, and renewable energy are popular choices within equity funds, aligning with China's economic priorities and offering strong growth prospects. Equity funds also benefit from digital platforms and fintech innovations, which have simplified access and attracted younger, tech-savvy investors. Personalized tools, such as robo-advisors, make it easier for individuals to invest in equity funds tailored to their goals and risk tolerance. While equity funds carry higher risk due to market volatility, their potential for long-term returns makes them a cornerstone for portfolio diversification, ensuring their continued dominance in China's mutual funds market.Regional InsightsThe East region was the leading area in China's mutual funds market due to its robust financial infrastructure and economic development. Major financial hubs like Shanghai and Shenzhen are in this region, making it a key driver of investment activity. These cities are home to a significant number of financial institutions, asset managers, and brokers, which contribute to higher mutual fund adoption. The East region also benefits from a high level of urbanization, with large and affluent populations, which translates into a greater investor base for mutual funds. Moreover, investors in the East tend to be more financially literate, having greater access to information and advisory services, further driving the growth of the mutual funds market. Additionally, Eastern China enjoys a strong middle class with disposable income that increasingly seeks diverse investment options, making mutual funds a popular choice.

Title: How DeepSeek Could Really Disrupt Big Tech

Time Published: 2025-01-31T12:46:00Z
Full Content:
The Chinese app has already hit the chipmaker giant Nvidia’s share price, but its true potential could upend the whole AI business model. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Only rarely does a single company’s new product provoke a major market sell-off. But that’s exactly what happened on Monday, when a large language model from a Chinese company named DeepSeek drove the entire Nasdaq index of tech companies down more than 3 percent and shaved more than 17 percent off the market capitalization of the chipmaker Nvidia—which, until that moment, had been the most valuable company in the world. The panicked selling of Nvidia had a surface logic. The company provides almost all of the computer chips (called GPUs) that companies such as Alphabet, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta rely on to train their LLMs. (The Atlantic entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI in 2024.) Consequently, it has been the biggest beneficiary of the huge boom in corporate spending on AI that we’ve seen over the past few years. (Nvidia’s annual revenue has quadrupled since 2022.) Although DeepSeek also used Nvidia chips to train its model, the company said that they were an older type of GPU—U.S. export controls imposed by the Biden administration have prevented Chinese companies from buying cutting-edge chips. DeepSeek’s disclosure raises the possibility that future progress in training LLMs could be made with fewer, simpler chips, and at a lower cost than previously anticipated. That would obviously put a big dent in Nvidia’s profits. So investors dumped its stock. Read: The DeepSeek wake-up call If investors are very concerned about how DeepSeek might hurt chipmakers, they seem surprisingly unconcerned about how it might affect big AI software companies. Meta’s stock price, for instance, actually rose on Monday, and although the stocks of Alphabet and Microsoft did take a hit, they bounced back over the next couple of days. Some of that is because the underlying business of these companies, independent of AI, remains enormously profitable. But it also suggests that investors aren’t paying enough attention to the way DeepSeek’s success could disrupt the AI market, and in doing so threaten the future profits of the tech companies that are currently spending many billions of dollars every year on their LLMs. Tech investors have historically profited by spotting the new new thing. But at the moment, they seem implicitly to assume that all of the fundamental change in the LLM business has already happened and that its future will look much like its present, with the companies that currently dominate the space—many of which are not simply competitors but also financial partners—continuing to do so indefinitely. What happened over the past week is a reminder that these assumptions may not be so solid. The large language model that caused such a stir on Monday, DeepSeek-R1, is clearly comparable with LLMs such as ChatGPT o1-mini and Claude 3.5. Measured by industry benchmarks that rate subject knowledge, reasoning, and accuracy, the DeepSeek model seems to deliver similar performance while costing much less to develop—though just how much less remains a matter of debate. Beyond dispute is that it’s cheaper to use: Consumers can get access to DeepSeek’s core functions for free, and third-party developers are being charged a fraction of the cost of a product such as ChatGPT. DeepSeek also uses open-source technology, meaning that, in theory, you could download the program and run your own AI on your desktop if you had a powerful-enough computer. The fact that the LLM offers reasonable performance—results that, even a year ago, would have seemed startlingly good—at a significantly lower cost means that it has to be taken seriously as a competitor. From one angle, in fact, DeepSeek looks like what the business-school professor Clayton Christensen, in his book The Innovator’s Dilemma, dubbed a “disruptive technology”: a product that’s less powerful than the products at the top of the market but also much cheaper, and that has the possibility of improving in quality over time to the point where it offers a superior combination of price and performance for most customers. In this regard, the rapid uptake of DeepSeek by users around the world has been striking. The LLM still has miles to go in market share to catch ChatGPT, which has more than 300 million weekly users, but since its release on January 20, its mobile-app version has been downloaded more than 3 million times from Google Play and Apple, making it the most popular app on both stores. That suggests that the cost of switching from one AI tool to another is very low, and that the moats big AI companies are building around their business may be much shallower than they’d hoped. Read: China’s DeepSeek surprise The underlying wager that these companies have made is that the big money they’re investing will result in radically better performance, which in turn will enable them to charge hefty sums to businesses and, to a lesser extent, consumers. (OpenAI, for instance, is reportedly targeting $100 billion in revenue by 2029.) And these companies remain committed to that bet. This week, the CEOs of both Microsoft and Meta said that enormous spending is essential to staying competitive in the market. Dario Amodei, a co-founder and the CEO of Anthropic (in which both Amazon and Google have invested heavily), wrote in a blog post that companies are going to continue to “spend more and more on training powerful AI models, even as … the cost of training a given level of model intelligence declines rapidly,” because “the economic value of training more and more intelligent models is so great.” In the long run, such investment may well result in the kind of performance improvement that a company like DeepSeek (which can’t even get access to the most powerful GPUs)—or the many other low-cost LLM developers that are sure to try to emulate it—cannot keep up with. When you look at ordinary users’ embrace of DeepSeek, though, you can also see an alternative future. In this one, AI performance improves so much that most customers are happy with cheap, good-enough LLMs, and AI models end up as essentially interchangeable, commoditized products, with the small profits that always follow that type of commercial diffusion. We’re going to find out whether the great authors of the disruptive technology that’s transforming the business world might themselves get disrupted.

Title: Streamer Dr Disrespect's YouTube income ban lifted after scandal
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86355xpl8no
Time Published: 2025-01-31T11:48:17Z
Full Content:
Controversial gaming streamer Herschel 'Guy' Beahm, known online as Dr Disrespect, has said he is able to start making money from YouTube again after being dropped in 2024. His announcement came on the same day as the gaming studio he co-founded said it was "closing its doors after three incredible years". Developer Midnight Society, which was working on shooter game Deadrop, cut ties with the YouTuber last year after becoming aware of "an allegation" against him. Beahm denied any wrongdoing, but admitted sending messages to "an individual minor" in 2017, insisting "nothing illegal happened". The content creator has 4.5 million subscribers on the platform and was dropped by various sponsors but declared on his stream on Thursday that "we've got our YouTube monetisation back". In a statement to BBC Newsbeat, YouTube said it had "reinstated" Dr Disrespect to its partner program "after careful review of the channel's recent activity". "Dr Disrespect was previously suspended... for violations of our Creator Responsibility policies. If there are further violations, we'll take appropriate action," it added. The Dr Disrespect character gained popularity for his chaotic style of play and aggressive - at times rude - commentary. Last year, Midnight Society terminated Beahm's role at the company, four years after he was abruptly kicked off streaming platform Twitch, where he had a big following. In 2022, Beahm and Twitch agreed a settlement, where neither party admitted any wrongdoing. The reason for his removal then was never made clear - with the Amazon-owned platform only saying it acted whenever users broke the rules. Last June, a former Twitch employee said the removal was linked to messages sent to a minor. Beahm responded: "Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me." He did though apologise to his "community and colleagues" for his actions. "That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father... it should have never happened", he wrote on social media. He was suspended from YouTube's partner program and retreated from streaming until September. In November he signed a deal with video platform Rumble to head its gaming division. The closure of Midnight Society comes amid wider struggles in the games industry, with Ubisoft and Bioware among notable companies already announcing cuts in 2025. Midnight Society previously announced layoffs in September 2024 but said it remained committed to releasing the game this year. In its statement announcing its closure, the company apologised for being "unable to reach our ultimate goal" of making Deadrop. The game got its start through the sale of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) - "one-of-a-kind" digital assets that experience an intial boom before vastly dropping in value. Some who invested have asked the company if they will be receiving refunds. BBC Newsbeat has requested comment from Midnight Society but not heard back. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here. Following a TikTok ban in the US, phones and iPads with the TikTok app preinstalled are up for sale. Experts say it's a security disaster waiting to happen. Many companies have left X but it's not always a simple decision. The US government says Chinese apps and online activities threaten Americans' security. But US internet users can't get enough of Chinese memes. The US President says he would like to see a "bidding war" over the sale of the social media app. More government help is needed to fund start-up companies in the gaming sector, says a chief exec.

Title: CEOs view Trump’s DEI ban as ‘opportunity to get away from woke policies’ at their own companies: Robby Starbuck

CEOs are feeling unburdened by what has been (as Kamala Harris would put it) — that is, the diversity, equity and inclusion policies that were de rigueur under the Biden administration. Just a week after President Trump signed an executive order banning DEI programs in the federal government, some executives are privately rejoicing that it could give them cover to roll back the most progressive policies at their companies. “It’s back to the future — meritocracy is back,” one executive at a publicly traded company said. “We aren’t going to have to base hiring on diversity, but competence.” This person added that, for the first time in over a decade, he believes he will be able to make the case to his board that DEI doesn’t need to be a priority. “Executives see this as an opportunity to get away from these woke policies because, in reality, a competent CEO has realized that DEI has lost money,” Robby Starbuck told NYNext. The corporate activist has leveraged his large following on X to pressure brands such as Tractor Supply, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, Ford and Nissan to alter or eliminate their DEI initiatives. Following a November campaign by Starbuck, Walmart pulled out of the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index and vowed not to carry chest binders marketed to children. Organizations like the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center have also begun waging public opinion wars against woke policies. And, during a virtual speech to Davos attendees last week, President Trump slammed Bank of America and Chase for alleged discrimination against conservatives — a move that could nudge the his supporters to bank elsewhere. It’s not just boycotts making CEOs weary. The legal implications of continuing certain DEI policies, such as hiring quotas, are also a growing concern, as the Department of Justice could potentially launch investigations or even lawsuits if companies violate anti-discrimination laws. While the 2023 Supreme Court decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard was focused on ending race-based affirmative action in college acceptance, it has also spurred discussions on how similar principles might apply to employment practices under Title VII, sources add. Over the last few months, some CEOs have very publicly walked back their DEI and their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) focus — with Larry Fink of BlackRock even pulling his company out of a notable UN climate initiative. Still others have defended the practice. When asked in a CNBC interview about potentially being targeted by the likes of Starbuck, JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said: “Bring them on.” But Starbuck believes that is because Dimon, and other executives like him, simply aren’t aware of how progressive DEI policies have become. Starbuck is also pushing to set up a debate with Dimon on CNBC’s morning show “Squawk Box” to hash it out on air, he added. “Executives’ immediate reaction is to defend their company … most of them have no clue what is going on — that Ibram X. Kendi is recommended reading.” According to Starbuck, companies like John Deere and Harley Davidson pushed employees to read Kendi’s book “How to Be an Antiracist” to employees — and even boasted about it on their corporate websites. “There is no return on investment of painting your business as political … and now there are possible legal liabilities for violating civil rights law.” Starbuck said. “[CEOs] may not have wanted to confront these policies but now they will be forced to be.” This story is part of NYNext, a new editorial series that highlights New York City innovation across industries, as well as the personalities leading the way.

Title: Foremost Meme Index Presale to Skyrocket as SEC Approves New ETFs

Time Published: 2025-01-31T10:30:32Z

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fast-tracked Bitwise’s application for the third Bitcoin-Ethereum exchange-traded fund ($BTC-$ETH ETF) in the US. The regulator hasn’t yet approved the ETF but might do so soon, which would allow Bitwise clients to gain indirect exposure to the two leading cryptocurrencies at once. While institutional investors are dipping their toes in crypto through ETFs, the degen community is discovering traditional investment vehicles like indexes. Meme Index ($MEMEX) could pioneer this new trend. Bitwise cleared the first resistance on the path to its ETF approval – the 19b-4 form. Now, the issuer awaits the approval of the S-1 form for the fund to hit the market. Earlier this week, Tuttle Capital also filed for ten altcoin ETFs, including meme coins $TRUMP, $MELANIA, and $BONK. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart points out that ETF issuers are probing the SEC’s boundaries. The SEC has already greenlit Canary Capital’s $LTC ETF, so the question is – where will regulators draw the line? The rapid growth of the $BTC ETF sector is a good case in point. The first spot $BTC ETFs by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale were approved in January 2024. A year later, there are 12 US $BTC ETFs with total cumulative inflows of $40.18B. Yesterday’s $BTC ETF inflows alone amounted to $588M, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF leading the charge ($321M). US $ETH spot ETFs also recorded $67.77M inflows yesterday, bringing the total inflows to $2.73B. Partly due to the accelerated institutional adoption driven by ETFs, $BTC rose 143% year-to-date and now trades at $$104K. If the SEC were to approve altcoin ETFs, the entire crypto market would surge due to added legitimacy and accessibility. While the Wall Street guys explore crypto through ETFs, degen traders tap into stock market products like indexes. Meme Index ($MEMEX) resolves the two main hurdles of meme coin investors – finding promising coins and managing risk. It introduces four meme coin indexes that cater to different risk appetites: Titan (the least volatile), Moonshot and MidCap (mid volatility), and Frenzy (high-risk, high-rewards assets). The meme coin market cap amassed $100B. New tokens enter the arena every day, and the leaderboard can change in the bat of an eye. That’s why putting all your hard-earned money into one project isn’t the best strategy. By investing in eight tokens instead of one, you spread risk and offset potential losses, thus enjoying higher average returns. Early adopters have already invested $3.1M in the $MEMEX presale and staked 139M tokens at a 718% dynamic APY. Beyond providing access to Meme Index baskets, the $MEMEX token gives its holders governance rights to steer the project’s direction. The lines between old-school finance and crypto are blurring. The SEC’s warming up to crypto ETFs – it has already said yes to $BTC and $ETH, so altcoins and even meme coins could be next. This means Wall Street is finally taking crypto seriously. And with projects like Meme Index, we see degens embracing the tried and tested investment strategies. All of this means one thing – there’s no way of stopping the crypto train. However, remember to DYOR before investing in any project. Even the broader bull run and strong project fundamentals don’t guarantee returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: M.M., Tempi, and the fainthearted, rumors of an acquisition by Piraeus bank, DEI and the Norwegians, and the… progressive lobbies of the stock market
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/01/31/m-m-tempi-and-the-fainthearted-rumors-of-an-acquisition-by-piraeus-bank-dei-and-the-norwegians-and-the-progressive-lobbies-of-the-stock-market/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T09:39:22Z
Full Content:
Tempi and Government Stress Levels Hello, the Tempi case continues to dominate public interest while also creating an extremely stressful situation within the government’s ranks, to the point where, dare I say, most of them are on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Not all of them, of course—there are also the level-headed ones who view Mitsotakis’ public appearance as a “necessary move for partial de-escalation and as proof to the public that the Prime Minister is listening, taking responsibility, and trying to solve problems, even assuming full accountability.” However, this is merely the calm assessment of some officials. There’s also the classic “fainthearted” reaction: “We’re doomed! The reports, the Preliminary Investigations, the trials are coming, and we’ll be entangled in this mess indefinitely.” Now, let me tell you what I know from my sources: First, the NTUA report, according to my information, will be ambiguous—it will state that the fireball was not caused by the lubricants used in the train’s engine, but at the same time, it will not confirm the presence of any flammable material. A report by a Belgian expert is expected to lean slightly more towards the existence of some quantity of flammable substance, but there are also reports suggesting otherwise. The government’s response to all this will be the obvious one: “Let everything go to the judiciary and let them draw the appropriate conclusions.” Second, regarding whether there will be a Preliminary Investigation Committee, the answer from an official source is crystal clear: “We’ve said dozens of times that if the Prosecutor’s indictment includes political figures, the government will facilitate the process and accept the establishment of a Preliminary Investigation Committee. But only if the judiciary requests it—not based on lawsuits filed by the victims’ families.” Third, the Tempi trial has been expected since day one. The government, through Floridis, even amended the law to expedite it, unlike the Mati trial, which took six years to begin. These are the facts, and this is the government’s approach. Where responsibility remains unclear is in what has been done from the time of the accident until now to allow the state to credibly say: “Here are the measures we’ve taken to drastically reduce the chances of this tragedy happening again.” Because, let’s not forget, accidents will always happen—whether in Washington, at the heart of the most technologically advanced transport system, or anywhere else. Also, a legal expert told me that the infamous case of backfilling (of the tracks) constitutes only a misdemeanor. As soon as K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) made statements about the Investigation Committee, former members of such committees turned pale. Many prominent figures involved avoided answering phone calls, something the government picked up on and decided to do some political “massaging.” The message from the government was that the Prime Minister’s position was a general one—this is his standard stance on Investigation Committees, which rarely produce clear conclusions. Therefore, the judiciary should be the one to provide the answers. I’m not sure if this improved anyone’s morale, but such is politics. February will be a long and rough month for the government, with various reports and inquiries on the way. Now, in M.M. (Maximos Mansion, the Greek Prime Minister’s office), they are not politically naive. They were not surprised by Androulakis’ intention to file a no-confidence motion against the government. The timing, of course, is the crucial factor. It’s clear that Androulakis is waiting for both the NTUA report and the report from EODASAAM (due on February 27) before making his move—coinciding with the second anniversary of the Tempi disaster. Obviously, he aims to align with public sentiment—thousands protesting in the streets while the government faces pressure in Parliament. Notably, this will be the second no-confidence motion filed by PASOK within a year. And to be fair, Androulakis is simply doing his job. Today’s Cabinet meeting, of course, is overshadowed by the Tempi case and the announcement of the no-confidence motion, but there are serious issues on the agenda. One of them is the Ministry of Education’s initiative to hire 600 priests over the next three years for the Greek-speaking Patriarchates. This has been a long-standing request of Patriarch Bartholomew, and Pierrakakis intends to grant it. It’s also a move with geopolitical significance, as Greece seeks to expand its soft power in the region, strengthening its influence through its Christian heritage. Now, let’s turn to market news, where all eyes are on a major move being prepared (intensely) by H. Megalou. But with acquisitions, you never really know—things usually turn out differently from what the market senses. Sources indicate that within the next two or three days, it will become clear whether Piraeus Bank’s plan will materialize. The very few details available suggest an acquisition, and not just any acquisition—a large-scale one. So, the “usual suspects” are ruled out. One rumor that surfaced on Dark Room’s radar—and let me stress, this is just a RUMOR, NOT VERIFIED INFORMATION—is that H. Megalou’s big move is towards acquiring Ethniki Asfalistiki (National Insurance). Given that acquisitions often turn out different from market expectations, this scenario could be plausible. But it’s not simple or easy—National Insurance’s bancassurance agreement is with National Bank of Greece, and I don’t know what penalties or clauses that contract might include. However, if this deal is indeed in the works, I assume they have found a way around it. Strategically, it would make sense, as the ECB’s rapid interest rate cuts are pushing banks to seek acquisitions in sectors with high commission revenues. I don’t know the details, but it seems that market rumors about a small lobby that has grabbed Proodeftiki’s stock and sent it skyrocketing are not unfounded. The stock has closed higher for five consecutive sessions. From €0.28, it has surged to €0.376 (+34%). In two of those five sessions, it gained over 9%, and yesterday it closed up 5.6%. Proodeftiki used to be a construction company—now, I have no idea what they do (some say real estate), but for all I know, they might as well be in aerospace. Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence have a uniquely Greek angle. A startup called AI-Employee has been operating in Greece and launched a soft rollout 10 days ago. What do they do? They “rent out” AI executives to large corporations. These specialized employees enter companies with their own hardware and localized AI models. In fact, as founder John Doxaras announced on LinkedIn, AI-Employee “sold out” in record time, managing to place ALL of its available AI professionals. These AI-powered employees come equipped with AI agents, work within organizations to solve problems on the spot, develop new applications and solutions, and provide extensive training on AI prompting. Despite being just two weeks old, the Greek startup has already attracted clients from the banking sector, telecommunications, and even government agencies. Now, let’s head to Paris, specifically to the Palais-Royal area, where the Greek Roadshow by Piraeus Securities took place at Espace Clery. The event featured Greece’s top publicly traded companies, and French fund managers showed intense interest, with 150 meetings held with 30 different funds—compared to last year’s 116 meetings with 24 funds. As an investor relations executive from a participating company explained, the French investment market is challenging due to its broad spectrum of investors. Some funds are highly targeted and long-term, seeing opportunities in Greece, while others, as one analyst put it, are starting “from scratch” with no real knowledge of the Greek market. However, what stood out to many IR professionals and executives was the sense of instability surrounding France’s economic and political outlook, a concern that surfaced repeatedly in discussions. Regarding Greek assets, the French highlighted clear advantages, such as Greece’s regained investment-grade rating, its comparatively strong economic growth within the EU, and high dividend yields. PPC (Public Power Corporation) is charging toward a €5 billion market cap, with its stock price at €13.27—an 11-year high. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the Norges Fund, known as the ultimate “long-only fund,” consistently invests in “green” projects and has officially acquired a 0.14% stake in PPC, though market whispers suggest its actual holding is higher. Over the past three months, 23.5 million PPC shares have changed hands, with the stock price rising more than 10.6%. This surge in activity has fueled fresh speculation about PPC’s next big deal, one that CEO Giorgos Stassis is rumored to be working on—though lately, he’s been keeping a low profile. The stock of Viohalco, the parent company of the Viohalco Group, has gained roughly 14% over the past month, reaching €6.10. Its market capitalization now exceeds €1.58 billion, while its 72%-owned subsidiary, Cenergy, has surpassed €2 billion (€9.60 per share, up 2.24% yesterday). This means that all the other subsidiaries within the group—ElvalHalcor, Noval Property, etc.—are currently valued at essentially zero, despite the fact that the group as a whole contributes 8% of Greece’s GDP. Unless the sky falls on our heads today, the General Index will log its fourth consecutive positive week of 2025 and its sixth straight week of gains since mid-December 2024. The index hasn’t closed above 1,550.72 points (+0.3%) since way back on April 7, 2011. However, with trading volume at €108.9 million (of which €8.2 million came from block trades), the rally isn’t exactly convincing. In fact, buyers were largely absent for most of yesterday’s session, only showing up after 4 PM to keep heavyweight stocks in positive territory. Coca-Cola, Eurobank, and Motor Oil propped up the index, while other blue-chip stocks simply managed to shake off their earlier losses and stabilize. Not one, not two, but a whopping 35-minute delay (!) in announcing its earnings sent Mark Zuckerberg’s META (who, by the way, is house-hunting in Washington to be as close as possible to Trump) into a tailspin, causing a mini-meltdown on Wall Street. In that half-hour, META’s stock price swung wildly up and down based on AI-related rumors. In the end, META beat analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings per share ($8.02/share), bringing in $48.4 billion in revenue. Microsoft’s stock went through a similar ordeal—it posted stronger-than-expected profits but weak cloud revenue, and in this new AI-driven market, everything counts. Amid all this digital economy turbulence, one thing that truly shines is gold, which hit a new all-time high of $2,840 per ounce, marking a staggering 40% gain over the past 12 months. “If the Fed had spent less time on DEI—the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strategy—gender ideology, ‘green’ energy, and the fake climate change, inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst inflation in our country’s history.” The term of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ends in 15 months, in May 2026. President Trump’s war against the Fed began on day one of his presidency. His view is that by increasing oil supply (“drill baby drill”), he will lower energy prices and, in turn, reduce inflation, leading to lower interest rates. Since January 20, crude oil and natural gas prices have dropped by more than 10%. Energy affects the Consumer Price Index by approximately 8%. However, energy costs also influence food prices and other services. Since Trump’s reelection in November, U.S. gasoline prices have dropped to $3.08 per gallon, close to the lowest level since 2021. Consequently: A $10 decrease in oil prices would reduce U.S. inflation by 0.2%. If oil prices fall to around $50, inflation could drop by nearly half a percentage point. However, the Fed’s priority is not just price stability—it also includes employment and economic stability. Some Federal Reserve Board members are Republicans (such as the St. Louis Fed banker), but they do not share Trump’s urgency to cut interest rates on the dollar, as the large public debt forces the Fed to borrow at high costs. The Trump-Powell war is only in its first phase. The German government announced the day before yesterday that economic growth in 2025 will barely exceed +0.3%, despite initial forecasts of +1.6%, later revised to +1.1%, and ultimately proven wrong. Yesterday, it was officially confirmed that in the fourth quarter of the year, Germany’s economic growth rate was negative (-0.2%), even worse than the initial estimates (-0.1%). Key economic indicators, such as the Ifo Business Climate Index or incoming orders, provide little reason for optimism. The elections in Germany are taking place in an atmosphere of general uncertainty, and we all know where that leads. Explore related questions

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Morgan Stanley's 15 Best European AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Iberdrola, S.A. (OTC:IBDRY) stands against Morgan Stanley's other European AI stocks. In August last year, investment bank Morgan Stanley released an investor note highlighting that even though the chaos around prominent AI firms had somewhat subsided, an AI rumbling in Europe was just about to begin. Analysts at the investment firm compared the AI buzz to historical similarities in the mid-1990s, just before the internet craze. According to Morgan Stanley analysts, European semi stocks were experiencing a tactical correction and would hit new highs in the coming months. The note further detailed that a basket of these equities, handpicked by these experts, and nicknamed AI winners, had returned close to 45% on average since January 2023, the beginning of the AI revolution. These firms had outperformed the 14% jump recorded by the MSCI Europe benchmark, per the research. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In the months since, European AI stocks have experienced significant volatility, most recently influenced by global developments and investor sentiment. A notable event was the introduction of a low-cost AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which raised concerns about the profitability of existing AI companies that rely on expensive chips and infrastructure. This led to a sharp decline in European tech stocks, with the European tech index dropping 5.8%, marking the worst decline since October 2024. However, the market showed resilience shortly after. European shares reached a record high, driven by gains in retail and utilities stocks as tensions in the tech sector subsided. European stock pickers are exploring established sectors such as utilities, professional data providers, and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of AI advancements. This approach reflects a strategic shift towards industries that can support and benefit from AI infrastructure and applications.

For this article, we selected companies based in Europe that have been benefiting from the AI boom. An important investor note by investment bank Morgan Stanley on European AI stocks formed the basis for this list. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Wind turbines against a backdrop of the sky, signifying the power of renewable energy. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/A Iberdrola, S.A. (OTC:IBDRY) is a Spanish firm that engages in the generation, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity in Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France, and Australia. Iberdrola's financial performance demonstrates significant growth, with a reported net profit of €5.5 billion and an EBITDA of €13.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024. This success is partly attributed to the company's strategic investments in AI to enhance operational efficiency and customer engagement. Collaborating with AWS, Iberdrola is developing generative AI applications to optimize energy production. AI data centers have created a need for power that is likely to drive utility firms towards the upgradation of their existing capacities to accommodate rising demand. Overall IBDRY ranks 11th on our list of Morgan Stanley's European AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of IBDRY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In the second half of 2024, the firm posted copper production of 489,000 tonnes, nearly 6% higher than the first half of 2024. Copper demand has surged due to the AI trends sweeping the business world. According to commodity trader Trafigura, copper demand linked to data centers and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030. This, in turn, would lead to supply deficits, driving prices upwards. Glencore is in a prime position to capitalize on these tailwinds. Overall GLNCY ranks 13th on our list of Morgan Stanley's European AI stocks.

Title: Trump’s crypto order could ‘break Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle’ – Bitwise predicts trillions in new capital
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/trumps-crypto-order-could-break-bitcoins-4-year-cycle-bitwise-predicts-trillions-in-new-capital/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T08:00:43Z
Full Content:
Is Bitcoin’s infamous four-year cycle coming to an end? Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes that President Donald Trump’s latest crypto executive order could upend the long-standing four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined the crypto market for over a decade. According to him, this regulatory shift can challenge the widely accepted market pattern, potentially altering how investors approach digital assets. With growing speculation about Trump’s influence on the crypto industry, this move could mark the beginning of a new market dynamic. It might diverge from historical trends and reshape expectations for the future of cryptocurrencies. Remarking on the same, Hougan wrote in a note to clients on 29 January. The note said, “If we were following the classic four-year cycle, 2025 would be a great year for crypto,” “We’re on the record predicting that bitcoin’s price will double this year to above $200,000, driven by flows into ETFs and bitcoin purchases by corporations and governments. That may turn out to be conservative.” Historically, Bitcoin [BTC] has followed a predictable four-year cycle, with three years of strong gains followed by a significant correction ranging from 58% to 74%. According to Hougan, this pattern has held true, with 2023 and 2024 delivering impressive returns, setting expectations for another strong year in 2025. However, he believes that investors are beginning to question whether 2026 could bring a market reset. While many attribute the cycle to Bitcoin’s halving events, Hougan claimed that broader market psychology and speculative behavior play a more significant role, shaped by key industry events such as exchange launches, major collapses, and regulatory crackdowns. He added, “If we were following the classic four-year cycle, 2025 would be a great year for crypto. And I think it will be: We’re on the record predicting that bitcoin’s price will double this year to above $200,000, driven by flows into ETFs and bitcoin purchases by corporations and governments. That may turn out to be conservative.” According to Hougan, the current mainstream crypto cycle emerged from the market turmoil of 2022, marked by the collapse of firms like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius. The turning point came on 10 March 2023, when Grayscale secured an initial victory in its legal battle against the SEC, paving the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Their launch in January 2024 attracted institutional investors, driving Bitcoin’s price from approximately $22,000 to over $100,000 within a year – Signifying crypto’s shift into the mainstream. Worth pointing out, however, that Hougan sees the timing as the biggest challenge ahead. While regulatory shifts and political developments in Washington favor long-term crypto growth, their full impact may take years to materialize. In fact, if these effects are only felt by 2026, Hougan questioned whether another “crypto winter” in 2025 would align with past market cycles. He said, “If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback?” While the crypto market is evolving, Bitwise’s CIO believes the traditional four-year cycle is not entirely behind us. As the bull market progresses, increasing leverage could still lead to corrections. However, with the industry’s growing maturity, he expects these downturns to be less severe and shorter in duration, compared to previous cycles. While volatility remains a factor, the resilience of the crypto space may help cushion future pullbacks, marking a shift in how market cycles play out. In conclusion, he put it best when he said, “As for now, it’s full steam ahead. The crypto train is leaving the station.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Five market signals flashing red amid DeepSeek sell-off

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. LONDON (Reuters) - In a week when AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) suffered the biggest one-day loss of value on record and the Federal Reserve said it was in no hurry to cut rates again, a few gauges underscore markets' vulnerability to big swings. Investors and analysts said the sell-off in tech stocks this week, driven by the popularity of China's DeepSeek AI model, highlights the market ructions that can occur when heavy speculation meets unexpected bad news. Here are five signals that highlight some of the tensions simmering. Despite Monday's ructions investors remain bullish about U.S. tech and President Donald Trump's plans for tax cuts and deregulation, heightening risks of market gyrations if this widespread consensus proves wrong. Short-term speculators have in recent months taken on more debt to magnify their gains, with levels of so-called gross leverage among hedge funds that trade U.S. stocks hitting their highest since 2010 in January, Morgan Stanley data showed. Citi's equity positioning model, derived from futures contracts, shows traders are heavily betting on further gains for Wall Street's tech-focused Nasdaq 100 (^NDX). "Everyone is sort of piled in. They're super optimistic," GAM chief multi-asset strategist Julian Howard said. These trends are making some long-term money managers nervous, with JPMorgan attributing part of Nvidia's violent Jan. 27 drop to traditional asset managers selling out. Kevin Thozet, investment committee member at Carmignac, said he had reduced exposure to U.S. tech stocks several days ago and added to positions that would profit if the Nasdaq fell, saying DeepSeek called U.S. tech-stock "exceptionalism" into question. High-for-longer U.S. interest rates, he added, might prompt U.S. households, now heavily invested in stocks, to pull money out. Analysis by the U.S. Office of Financial Research has also found strong correlations between retail investment in speculative assets, such as crypto-currencies and use of consumer credit, signaling last year's rate cuts fueled market gains. The highest bond yields in years could also dent stocks' appeal as investors can now get returns of 4% or more on government debt. One measure of the equity risk premium - the extra return investors can expect for stocks - dropped below zero in December for the first time since the aftermath of the dot-com bubble in 2002. "When people talk about managing volatility amidst all this, one of the areas which does it really well is short-dated fixed income," said GAM's Howard. Since the Nov. 5 U.S. election, traders have doubled the size of their bets that the dollar (DX=F) will rise. They now hold net short positions - a bet on the value of something falling - in all other major currencies. This has only happened on rare occasions in the last 10 years, LSEG data shows. Much of this positioning is predicated on the Fed cutting rates more slowly than elsewhere, and an assumption that tariffs and tax cuts spark higher inflation and government borrowing, meaning any change to that scenario could be problematic for the U.S. currency. High concentration in tech stocks has made portfolios vulnerable, analysts say, and a rush to alternatives, such as Japan's yen (JPY=X) and European credit, is another sign of fast-changing market dynamics. As European shares have hit record highs, Bank of America data showed money has flowed into European credit funds for 23 consecutive weeks. The VIX (^VIX), which measures how volatile traders expect the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to become, is below its long-run average of about 20. But it has spiked out of nowhere twice in the last six months, once in August when a surge in the yen wreaked global havoc and again in December when the Fed hinted it would slow the pace of rate cuts. Rob Almeida, global investment strategist and portfolio Manager at MFS International, described markets as "fragile" and said Monday's heavy stock selling may have been driven by "leverage that might be being unwound and isn't being accounted for".

Title: Paul Costelloe: ‘I look at everything, what people are wearing, what plates, shapes of mugs – you can do so much more with a creative brain'

He will be 80 in June but veteran Irish fashion designer Paul Costelloe shows no sign of slowing down. He continues to show at London Fashion Week, which he has done for the past 40 years as well as designing homewares, womenswear and menswear lines for Dunnes Stores. Last September, he launched his first bridal collection called Primavera, 15 dresses inspired by his couture collection. He also has a rake of profitable licenses including a jewellery and accessories collection for the American QVC shopping channel. We meet at his Monkstown home, bought in 1984, a beautiful Regency building which, after he moved to London in 1999, was rented to a French family. Adjoining it is a converted coach house where his mother-in-law resided until recently. On this brief visit to Dublin, he is staying there with his wife Anne and their son William, design director of the company, a gifted artist who trained at the Chelsea School of Art. Dressed casually in a blue hoodie and jeans, Costelloe reflects on his early career over coffee in the kitchen, recalling his first fashion presentation in London in the early 1980s, with Northern Irish financial support, at the Hyde Park Hotel, along with John Rocha. “I was worried about making money because I had children. A journalist told me I needed to be more adventurous, and I remember feeling I was not as adventurous as I should have been. Now I am too adventurous,” he grins. Having trained in the Grafton Academy and worked in Paris with fashion designer Jacques Esterel, followed by two years in Milan with Rinascente and four in New York, he was invited to show at the inaugural British Designer Show (precursor of London Fashion Week) in Olympia in 1984. He told Vogue that he had wanted to be the Irish Ralph Lauren. Recalling that period, he mentions Katherine Hamnett’s famous anti-nuclear T-shirt worn to 10 Downing Street to meet Margaret Thatcher that year. “Fashion made statements then,” he says admiringly. “Now, it is just dictated by a couple of brands mostly in Italy and France and we follow on their coat tails, so it is an uneven field – to get recognised you either have to be 18 or a millionaire. Being a boring middle-class father of seven is not the most exciting prospect, which I am happy with, but maybe pride drives me on.” Youngest of a family of seven himself, he attributes the trait of pride to his late father, from whom he also inherited a love of textiles. “He was an industrious, courageous manufacturer in Dublin, a self-made man from Limerick with a glamorous American trophy wife from New York. Having American culture and Irish culture in those days was very extreme, but it produced plenty of interesting people though maybe not the happiest,” he concedes. Cosmetics and perfume is where the money is. I have tried that, but without success, so it keeps me humble. You are always prepared for the downside. The high points of his long career, he says, are easy to remember and he does not include, somewhat surprisingly, being the personal designer for Princess Diana, with whom he has always been associated. He lists them as follows: “winning the Caltex Art Competition for under 16s when I became something of a hero in Blackrock College for maybe a day or two. Designing the British Airways uniforms and travelling by Concorde to Hong Kong, Brazil and Argentina. The collaboration with Wedgwood on ceramics and porcelain in the north of England. Getting married two days before Christmas and having the car washed before we went into the church”. The Wedgwood tableware sold well in the US but not in Japan, so it was a disappointment. “I think big and I design big, but I didn’t consider the Japanese market so it slumped there,” he says. He also has memories of working in New York for four years designing lingerie for Larry Sunshine (“no sunshine and very ruthless”) on the 85th floor of the Empire State Building and designing a wedding dress for Tricia Nixon (Richard Nixon’s daughter) in 1971. Back in Ireland, he launched his first collection in 1978, remembered for its spectacular and tailored use of Irish linen from Strelitz and Moygashel in Northern Ireland and building the business to the point where he had concessions throughout the UK and free-standing stores. It was in one of these, in Windsor, where a lady in waiting for Princess Di first saw his work in 1983, opening the door to Kensington Palace. “Linen is my birthright for some reason,” he says of his regular use of the fabric. His first runway show in London a year later called Witness, based on the Harrison Ford Amish movie, featured those romantic linen dresses. A collaboration this year will bring that focus on linen full circle, but he is reluctant to divulge details. “As a designer I always looked for collaborations which are now quite common, but in those early days designers had to survive on their own merits. I prefer to use other people’s money to exploit my creativity. I always see financial advantage over good taste and that is how I have managed to give my children a decent education. It is about compromise and for a designer that’s not the best,” he says with a shrug. Which brings us to his long association with Dunnes and he is predictably enthusiastic, describing it as “an amazing company”. He explains how it started 15 years ago after Debenhams had launched a “Designers at Debenhams” brand introducing Jasper Conran and John Rocha. “I hadn’t been approached, so I contacted Margaret Heffernan and we met up and agreed to collaborate on homewares, which is still the foundation of the Paul Costelloe brand. I deal with Margaret directly – we have regular conversations and meet for coffee in the Herbert Park Hotel. I have a lot of respect for her and her daughter Ann (Heffernan), a doctor who looks after food and niece Sharon [McMahon], who is head of textiles.” He deals with and travels with Dunnes’ buyers. “My son William is just back from China and Hong Kong, where the [Dunnes] buyers wrangled the best products at the best prices. We go to India in the spring. We started womenswear in 2011 on the success of the homewares – menswear was slow to start because, typical males, they don’t move. Men are consistent – boringly so at times – but once you win them over, they really get enthusiastic, and I find that a lot more fun than women who say ‘why are you not making in my size?’” [ Our fashion designers make waves globally, so why don’t we value their cultural contribution here?Opens in new window ] Men’s wear, now in its 10th year, is stocked in 50 stores across the country and he gets accurate sales figures on a monthly basis on each collection. Though Dunnes does not publish accounts, Costelloe’s design management company has been posting profits since 2016, a year after his association with Ireland’s retail giant, though the latest accounts, to the end of August 2023, show a loss of €152,055 in 2023, down from a profit in 2022 of €511,410, a bumper year for the company. The loss trimmed accumulated profits at Paul Costelloe Design Management Ltd from €2.2 million to just over €2 million, according to a report in The Irish Times in June. He pays tribute to his financial director Gerry Mescal (a distant relative of the actor Paul), whom he dubs “Mr Cautious” and who has “looked after us for 40 years”. Costelloe’s advice to aspiring young fashion designers is always to have a good accountant. The catwalk shows have changed in their purpose since he first showed at London Fashion Week. “Before, the catwalk was the commercial vendor of the brand, so it was important that people buy into it. Now, it is a couture collection of one-off pieces which keeps up consumer brand awareness outside the UK and Ireland because [the show] gets covered all over the world, so it’s like an art gallery and not a collection. “People will say we saw your show on the TV in Hong Kong. It keeps it international, so it is worthwhile as we sell a lot online – handbags and other accessories, and that is growing.” Runway shows are expensive to stage – the last two in London cost €500,000. “That’s compared to the Italian shows, which cost a couple of a million each. But they have cosmetics and perfume and that is where the money is. I have tried that, but without success, so it keeps me humble. You are always prepared for the downside.” Free from the imperative commercial constraints of his first shows and for the high-street market, his London fashion collections are more spirited, flamboyant and colourful with that mix of tailoring and what the French call flou very much his signature. Left-handed, he continues to draw and paint and is physically active, with a 50-minute cycle to work every day from his home in Putney to his studio in central London. He plays tennis at weekends when he can. His sons are very supportive, and he works closely with William and loves going with him to Milan to select fabrics at the Milano Unica trade show. They are currently collaborating on a revamped revival of his brand Dressage launched in Brown Thomas in 1988. He retains clothing rights to the name. “Creativity and integrity will always win out and you take on board your past in your designs and we have done a lot over the years, but you don’t look back, we don’t indulge in the past. I look at everything, what people are wearing, what plates, shapes of mugs – you can do so much more with a creative brain,” he says. Painting is easier, he says. “You can sit on a wall and paint the landscape, but to design you must have discipline and know who is going to make your toile [test garment]. Sometimes my lovely drawings get lost in translation. We are hands on, it’s like farming, we work and feel with our hands.” On February 20th, he will once again open London Fashion Week at 9am, which he has been doing for the past 15 years, most recently in the ballroom of the Waldorf Hilton. But “it’s a poisoned chalice” he says with a wry grin.

Title: Chinese state-linked accounts hyped DeepSeek AI launch ahead of US stock rout, Graphika says

For premium support please call: For premium support please call: By Katie Paul and Stephen Nellis NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese state-linked social media accounts amplified narratives celebrating the launch of Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI models last week, days before the news tanked U.S. tech stocks, according to online analysis firm Graphika. The accounts involved in the effort, including those of Chinese diplomats, embassies and state media, amplified media coverage of the launch and promoted the idea that DeepSeek challenged U.S. dominance in the AI sector, New York-based Graphika said in a report it provided to Reuters on Thursday. The messaging was rolled out on platforms such as Elon Musk's X and Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, as well as Chinese services Toutiao and Weibo, Graphika said. "This activity shows how China is able to quickly mobilize a range of actors that seed and amplify online narratives casting Beijing as surpassing the U.S. in critical areas of geopolitical competition, including the race to develop and deploy the most advanced AI technologies," Graphika Chief Intelligence Officer Jack Stubbs told Reuters. "We've consistently seen overt and covert Chinese state-linked actors among the first movers in leveraging AI to scale their operations in the information environment." Graphika said it also found a video featuring pro-China, anti-Western content on a YouTube channel whose activity resembled that of Shadow Play, a coordinated influence campaign involving at least 30 YouTube channels that was first identified by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in 2023. YouTube owner Alphabet, Meta, X and the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. Graphika said it found a small spike in discussion about DeepSeek's advancements in relation to OpenAI's ChatGPT on X immediately after DeepSeek released its models on Jan. 20, followed by a much larger uptick that started on Friday and continued to build over the weekend. By Monday, DeepSeek's free AI assistant had overtaken U.S. rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's app store and global investors dumped U.S. tech stocks, wiping $593 billion off chipmaker Nvidia's market value in a record one-day loss for any company on Wall Street. Nvidia declined to comment on the Graphika report. DeepSeek's researchers claim to have developed aspects of their AI model at a far lower cost than U.S. rivals, sparking worries that U.S. companies that have plowed tens of billions of dollars into AI data centers could face a price war with China. Shares of Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI that operates data centers on behalf of the ChatGPT creator, slid earlier this week when it disclosed slower cloud revenue growth than Wall Street expected while it continued to plow billions into capital expenditures. Microsoft and Meta have vowed to continue deep investments in AI for the foreseeable future. DeepSeek's rise to prominence was celebrated in China as a sign that the nation was beating back Washington's attempts to contain China's tech industry with curbs on technology exports. In the U.S., DeepSeek's accomplishments sparked accusations that it had improperly accessed technology from OpenAI and other leaders, though the allegations remain unproved. The U.S. Commerce Department is looking into whether DeepSeek has been using U.S. chips that are not allowed to be shipped to China, a person familiar with the matter said.

Title: Will Chainlink (LINK) Overtake Cardano’s (ADA) Market Cap? Unlikely, But This Crypto Might

The ongoing market downturn has sparked discussion about which cryptocurrency will hold its group once the bull cycle returns. Crypto investors are wondering if Chainlink (LINK) can surpass Cardano’s (ADA) market value, especially as LINK struggles to rebound from a price drop. While Chainlink may not reach Cardano’s market cap anytime soon, Rexas Finance (RXS), a trending presale token, is set to achieve that soon. Chainlink’s Battle to Overtake Cardano by Market Cap Chainlink’s price drops, and FUD worries the crypto community about its future. At $19.88, LINK’s has dipped 39% in the past month. Its market cap hovers around $12.5 billion, compared to Cardano’s $35 billion. Despite recent encouraging developments like the Chainlink-Blackrock cooperation, LINK is unlikely to reach Cardano’s market worth. Chainlink’s price history, market dynamics, and growth are issues. Analysts estimate favorable market sentiment might push LINK’s price toward $43 or $50 per token in 2025. Chainlink’s rise may boost short-term growth, but it will struggle to match Cardano’s market position, which is backed by steady growth and community support. Rexas Finance (RXS): A New Crypto Contender Set to Flip Cardano While Chainlink fights market sentiment, Rexas Finance simplifies tokenizing real-world assets. This move breaks down barriers that have kept investors out of valuable marketplaces like real estate, art, and commodities markets. This move makes Rexas Finance a leader in an industry expected to reach $50 billion by 2025 and $16 trillion by 2030. Tokenizing real-world assets is Rexas Finance’s novel solution to liquidity, fractional ownership, and global investment. Its blockchain approach offers better liquidity and investment options than traditional methods. The ecosystem relies on the utility and governance of Rexas Token (RXS), which the platform uses for liquidity and rewards. One of Rexas Finance’s biggest advantages is its user-friendly platform for tokenizing real-world assets. The Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot let non-coders generate and manage tokens for real-world assets. This accessibility allows startups and major organizations to tokenize assets, democratizing investing and enhancing liquidity. Rexas Finance is also adding innovative features, such as Rexas GenAI, an AI-driven platform that simplifies NFT and digital asset generation, and Rexas AI Shield, which secures blockchain transactions. These new features help the project become a crypto market leader. The project’s focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) also helps it flourish. Rexas Finance is well-positioned to encourage DeFi adoption. Rexas Treasury delivers optimum yield farming options across several blockchains and the Rexas DeFi ecosystem, providing a secure and transparent platform for earning yields on digital assets. To attract both experienced investors and newbies to crypto, Rexas Finance is establishing a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges traditional asset management with the decentralized world. Rexas Finance’s presale has been nothing short of remarkable, with each stage selling out ahead of schedule. Stage 11, which is now 97% complete, has increased the price by almost 6x, with RXS now priced at $0.175 per token. As the presale nears completion, Rexas Finance’s momentum is likely to grow, gaining attention from large investors. Upon the completion of the presale, RXS will debut on at least three of the top 10 global crypto exchanges, a move that will significantly enhance liquidity, push up the price, and extend the project’s market share. This forthcoming exchange debut is a crucial turning point for Rexas Finance. It will promote the token to a larger audience, thus strengthening its market presence. Rexas Finance will capitalize on its early success and grow swiftly in the next few months. Analysts forecast continuous growth and a parabolic price jump after its exchange listings. Conclusion Due to price volatility and market sentiment, Chainlink may struggle to overtake Cardano’s market cap, but Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a compelling alternative for investors seeking the next major crypto. A rising presale, a new approach to real-world asset tokenization, and a future listing on key exchanges position Rexas Finance for market growth. After acquiring a share of the $16 trillion RWA market and launching an exchange, Rexas Finance will be a powerful crypto competitor. With its focus on innovation, security, and liquidity, Rexas Finance may soon overtake Cardano’s market cap, making it an excellent investment for forward-thinking crypto enthusiasts.

As the presale nears completion, Rexas Finance’s momentum is likely to grow, gaining attention from large investors. Upon the completion of the presale, RXS will debut on at least three of the top 10 global crypto exchanges, a move that will significantly enhance liquidity, push up the price, and extend the project’s market share. This forthcoming exchange debut is a crucial turning point for Rexas Finance. It will promote the token to a larger audience, thus strengthening its market presence. Rexas Finance will capitalize on its early success and grow swiftly in the next few months. Analysts forecast continuous growth and a parabolic price jump after its exchange listings.

If approved, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC will serve as the custodian. At the same time, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing will act as the fund's transfer agent, according to a 19b-4 filing submitted Thursday. Grayscale’s XRP Trust is one of several investment vehicles the firm has converted or is in the process of converting amid surging demand for digital asset-based investment offerings. The move follows the firm's successful conversion of its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF on January 11, 2024, and its Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF six months later. Grayscale has also sought SEC approval to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund—holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP—into a diversified multi-crypto ETF. In January 2025, the firm rebalanced the fund, increasing Bitcoin and Ethereum’s share to 90% while replacing Avalanche with Cardano. Issuers are rushing to gain approval for new crypto-based ETFs after Donald Trump secured a second presidential term in November. Along the campaign trail, Trump promised to shore up US regulations while making the country the crypto capital of the world. Grayscale’s XRP Trust holds roughly $16.1 million in assets under management. Its shares are held by American investor accounts seeking exposure to XRP “without the cost and complexity of purchasing the asset directly,” according to the filing. Investment trusts are closed-end funds that have a fixed number of shares, while ETFs are open-end funds that generate shares based on investor demand. As such, ETFs are typically more suitable investment vehicles to meet demand for an asset such as XRP, though that depends on investor preferences and market conditions. In any case, investor demand for XRP has proved particularly strong in recent weeks, with the token nearly breaking its all-time high of $3.40 earlier this month. XRP is trading at $3.13, up more than 525% in the past year. Investor interest in digital assets has soared in recent months, fueled by the launch of the widely popular spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. from major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity. Asset managers such as Rex Shares, Canary Capital, and 21 Shares have applied to launch XRP exchange-traded funds in recent months. At the same time, issuers have refiled a batch of previously rejected Solana ETF applications earlier this month. The filings form part of a broader crypto ETF boom under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, with issuers also applying to launch funds tracking the prices of Chainlink, Cardano, and Polkadot, as well as newer meme coins such as Official Trump (TRUMP) and BONK.

Investing in stocks and earning money from dividends is a proven way to build wealth in the long run, but choosing the right companies to invest in can make or break people’s financial dreams. Many investors have achieved amazing financial goals by carefully researching companies, understanding their financial situation and analyzing their growth and income potential.

While the Funds will continue to consider ESG criteria when selecting issuers for their portfolios, they will no longer prioritize these factors over others such as valuation, growth projections, and the quality and track record of the management team. The Manager believes these changes will broaden the investment universe of the Funds, potentially leading to better returns for investors. The Funds will file a Prospectus by April 10, 2025, at which point each of the Funds will revise their name as shown below. There will be no change to the ticker symbols of the Funds. The Manager notes that similar efforts to de-emphasize ESG factors have been undertaken by many asset management companies, including BlackRock, State Street, JPMorgan, and Pimco. Recent research from Morningstar has shown that more funds are removing rather than adding ESG mandates from their investment practices. On March 7, 2024, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced three categories of ESG-Related Funds: ESG Objective Funds, ESG Strategy Funds, and ESG Limited Consideration Funds. Each category has distinct expectations regarding the emphasis on ESG factors in investment decisions. The Manager believes that the proposed changes will result in the Funds moving from the ESG Objective Funds category to the ESG Limited Consideration category.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Democrats have paid a political price for taking on Silicon Valley — but not a very expensive one. by Eric Levitz In January 2017, Sergey Brin rallied beside progressive activists at San Francisco International Airport to protest Donald Trump’s travel ban. Eight years later, the Google co-founder sat with right-wing nationalists at Trump’s second inauguration. Brin is far from the only tech mogul who has (apparently) warmed to Trump in recent years. Mark Zuckerberg once bankrolled liberal causes. Now, the Facebook founder dines with America’s favorite insurrectionist at Mar-a-Lago. In 2016, Marc Andreessen argued that Hillary Clinton was the “obvious choice” for president, and that any proposal to choke off immigration “makes me sick to my stomach.” Last year, Andreessen endorsed Trump. And, of course, Elon Musk has gone from being an Obama-supporting climate hawk to quite possibly the single most influential advocate for — and patron of — far-right politics in the United States. The lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. Silicon Valley’s apparent rightward shift was already causing consternation in blue America last year. But Democrats’ outrage and anxiety over the red-pilling of Silicon Valley has only increased since Inauguration Day — when Brin, Zuckerberg, Musk, Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook all sat with Trump’s camp in the Capitol Rotunda. Some Democrats view Big Tech’s rightward lurch as a political crisis, one brought on by their own party’s policy mistakes. In this account, Democrats needlessly alienated a powerful industry by embracing an anti-corporate economic agenda that is both politically costly and substantively misguided. Others in the party, meanwhile, insist that the Biden administration’s attempts to tame Big Tech’s power were both good politics and good policy. In their telling, voters hate corporate monopolies and love antitrust enforcement. And the extraordinary wealth and power of large tech companies constitute a threat to democratic government — a reality that Silicon Valley’s present chumminess with Trump only underscores. From this vantage, the tech industry’s interests and the general public’s were always irreconcilable. And as Silicon Valley grew wealthier, it was bound to gravitate toward America’s more pro-business party. The Biden administration’s error, therefore, was not doing too much to antagonize Big Tech, but too little. This debate collapses together several distinct questions. Some of these are ideological — such as whether the Biden administration’s approach to antitrust enforcement was worthwhile on the merits. Today though, I want to focus on two factual questions at the center of the intra-Democratic dispute over Big Tech: I think the answers to both these questions are more complicated than either progressive or pro-business Democrats allow. To understand why Silicon Valley has moved right in recent years, it’s helpful to consider what had previously tethered the industry to the center-left. Many in the tech world argue that Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party were long bound by an implicit “deal”: Democrats would support the development of new technology, celebrate entrepreneurs, and take a light touch approach to regulating the digital sphere — in exchange for tech moguls backing socially liberal causes, progressive taxation, incremental expansions of the welfare state, philanthropies, and Democratic candidates. This was a pretty good bargain for the typical tech founder — since it effectively entailed the Democratic Party embracing nearly all of their preferences. Survey data on the views of Silicon Valley moguls is limited. But a 2017 study of tech entrepreneurs’ politics found that they were left-leaning on almost all issues — including taxation and redistribution — but quite right-wing on questions of government regulation and labor unions. This distinct ideological profile has been dubbed “liberal-tarian.” Given that Democrats have always been the party more supportive of regulating industry and promoting organized labor, the party’s alliance with tech was long fraught with some tension. But in recent years, both sides began souring on their supposed contract for a variety of reasons. But three were especially significant: When an industry is enjoying explosive growth, it has less incentive to align with the right. Democrats might nibble into its profits with their relatively high taxes, or inch its compliance costs with their greater regulatory scrutiny. But when your sector is awash in cheap financing and soaring revenues, the price of allying with a left-of-center party can look negligible. As Andreessen put the point to the New York Times earlier this month, back in the days of Clinton and Obama, “the tax rates didn’t really matter because when an internet company worked, it grew so fast and got so valuable that if you worked another three years, say, you’d make another 10 X. Another 5 percent higher tax rate washed out in the numbers.” Silicon Valley enjoyed such favorable conditions for much of the 2010s. But the tech boom faded during Biden’s tenure. In 2022, rising interest rates started diverting capital away from the tech sector: With safe assets now offering an attractive guaranteed return, investors grew more reluctant to funnel cash into risky ones. Stock market valuations fell and layoffs spread. At the same time, as Noah Smith notes, tech investors and executives started running up against structural constraints on profit-making. Many venture capitalists looked at Google and Facebook’s success in cornering and dominating their respective markets, and bet that they could establish similarly monopolistic businesses in other corners of digital commerce. But by 2022, they’d discovered that achieving such market dominance was harder than they’d thought. Meanwhile, social media companies struggled to combat the inherently finite nature of human attention: Once you’ve lured roughly 5 billion humans onto social media — and turned a hefty percentage of them into addicts — there’s only so much screen time left to monetize. In this context, we would expect tech moguls who’d been only lightly committed to the “liberal” part of liberal-tarianism to start heeding their own narrow material interests. After all, it was a similar mix of rising interest rates, inflation, and slowing profitability that helped prompt corporate America’s right turn in the 1970s. To be sure, the tech industry’s fortunes have rebounded since 2022, thanks in no small part to the AI boom. But the experience of a capital crunch and profit squeeze — however temporary — seems to have made a lasting impression on many in tech, whose political contributions began shifting (modestly) toward Republicans in 2022. For the reasons above, it wouldn’t have been surprising for the tech industry to have drifted toward Republicans over the past four years, even if Democratic policy remained as friendly to tech as had it been under Barack Obama. In reality, the Biden administration took a much more adversarial stance than its predecessors. Biden’s Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department collectively brought antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft. This blitzkrieg of aggressive antitrust enforcement naturally irritated Silicon Valley’s giants. Perhaps less predictably, it also antagonized smaller tech firms and startups. In theory, one might expect “little tech” would want the government to curb the market power of their gargantuan competitors. In practice, however, many startup founders and investors aspire to either grow their own firms into behemoths, or failing that, get bought up by a larger company. By chilling merger activity, the Biden administration effectively blocked many startups’ “plan B,” while choking off a reliable source of returns for venture capitalists. VCs and startups also took exception to the Biden Securities and Exchange Commission’s vigorous regulation of cryptocurrency, as well as the administration’s executive order on AI safety. In November 2023, a contingent of startup founders and investors denounced the latter, arguing that the order’s reporting requirements put small AI firms at a competitive disadvantage, as they could less comfortably shoulder regulatory compliance costs than their larger rivals. Finally, Biden proposed a new tax on the unrealized capital gains of Americans with more than $100 million in wealth. This would mean that when a megamillionaire investor’s stock portfolio or real estate holdings gained $5 million in value, they would need to pay a tax on that amount, even if they did not sell those assets. Tax policy wonks like this idea. But super-rich tech investors very much do not. And when Kamala Harris announced her support for Biden’s plan last summer, Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists had a conniption. Super-rich tech moguls care about making money. But they are often at least as covetous of social status. Past a certain point, accumulating more wealth has little practical impact on your living standards (or those of your children, or your children’s children). But a person’s appetite for greater prestige tends to be less exhaustible than their desire for beach homes, Porsches, or private jets. Thus, if Democrats had spent the past decade exalting tech investors and founders, it’s possible that the party’s increasingly adversarial policies would have caused less rancor in Silicon Valley. But Democrats became increasingly disillusioned with the tech industry over the course of the 2010s. And this culminated in a Democratic administration that undermined tech billionaires’ sense of self-importance. “At the core level, both Barack Obama and the modal Democrat thought the average Silicon Valley company was really good and cool in 2009,” Marc Aidinoff, a historian and policy adviser in both the Obama and Biden administrations, told me. “Obama would go to Silicon Valley and have dinner with the CEOs and call them champions of change. What these people really wanted from the president was the sense that they were loved.” But by 2021, things had changed, according to Aidinoff. “Joe Biden distrusts these people, thinks they are hurting Americans, and has the sense that they aren’t actually making much of real value,” he said. The Democrats’ disenchantment with tech wasn’t attributable to Biden’s personal skepticism of Silicon Valley alone. After the financial crisis, the party’s progressive wing grew more influential. And its ascent increased the salience of both inequality and labor issues in Democratic politics. For a party increasingly concerned with wealth concentration and workers’ rights, tech giants that generated vast fortunes off “winner-take-all” markets — while, in many cases, committing labor violations or undermining traditional employment — did not look like engines of progress. As importantly, the notion that social media platforms promoted democracy and social reform fell into disrepute. In the wake of Obama’s election and the Arab Spring — both of which were widely credited to novel media technologies — many liberals bought into the idea that Facebook and Twitter would abet a more egalitarian politics. But authoritarian regimes proved adept at restricting online speech. And if social media’s potential to facilitate rightwing extremism wasn’t clear to liberals before 2016, it was apparent to them afterward. Following Trump’s victory, many Democrats blamed their party’s defeat on Facebook’s dissemination of “fake news.” Around the same time, research suggesting that social media could have adverse mental health effects started to accumulate. All this — combined with tech platforms’ adverse impact on traditional journalism — led the mainstream media to view Silicon Valley more critically. Between 2012 and 2019, the New York Times’ coverage of Facebook turned sharply negative, according to one prominent data analysis. Add in Silicon Valley’s growing enthusiasm for crypto — a technology that appeared to be good for little beyond scams and speculation — and it isn’t hard to see why Democrats soured on Big Tech. The party’s newfound skepticism of the industry didn’t just translate into greater regulatory scrutiny, but also, a withholding of both praise and access. According to some in tech, the sector’s leading lights felt themselves shunned and slighted by the Biden White House. “I think the fundamental problem, and I heard this from many, was that former President Biden was unwilling to meet with tech CEOs and entrepreneurs,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me. “It was that simple.” One former Biden official echoed this assessment, saying that tech companies “couldn’t get meetings with a lot of the key regulators. Certainly [FTC commissioner] Lina [Khan] wouldn’t meet with people — she liked to say, ‘We’re enforcement, you can’t really meet with us.’” Andreessen recently reminisced that Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party had “celebrated” and “loved” tech companies. Biden’s Democratic Party, by contrast, often refused Andreessen’s ilk the time of day. It’s clear then that Silicon Valley’s rightward turn was precipitated, at least in part, by a change in the Democratic Party’s attitudes and policies toward the tech industry. And there’s reason to think that the party’s anti-tech turn is politically costly on net. Were other tech billionaires to emulate Musk’s political giving — or other social media companies to imitate X’s boosting of right-wing content — the damage to Democrats could be considerable. And the Trump administration’s manifest openness to trading political power for financial support makes this a live possibility, especially if Democrats promise to reprise the Biden administration’s policies toward the industry. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that aggressively regulating Silicon Valley can gain Democrats meaningful support elsewhere. This is not because voters oppose that general goal: In fact, in a 2024 Pew Research poll, a slight majority expressed support for increasing regulation of the tech industry, while a supermajority said that social media has had a “mostly negative” effect on the United States. The problem is that voters have ambivalent feelings about Big Tech writ large, and do not consider regulating the companies a priority. When Gallup asked Americans what their country’s most important problem was this month, only 1 percent named “corporate corruption” while 0 percent picked “technology.” In a post-election survey from Morning Consult and the Chamber of Progress (a trade group of companies allied with the Democratic Party), voters were presented with a list of 12 issues, and asked to name the two that were most important to their vote. Only 2 percent of respondents picked “regulating technology companies” as one of their priorities, making it the single least prioritized objective on the list (by contrast, 49 percent selected “controlling inflation and strengthening the economy”). Meanwhile, in YouGov’s polling, Amazon’s approval rating sits at 74 percent, Google’s at 70 percent, Apple’s at 69 percent, and Facebook at 59 percent. Given all this, it’s plausible that Democrats have more to lose than gain politically from taking on Big Tech. Yet it’s also true that the political costs of the party’s anti-tech turn have been routinely overstated. In truth, Silicon Valley’s rightward shift — while real — has been remarkably modest, whether measured in votes or donations. In 2020, Biden won Santa Clara County, which includes much of Silicon Valley, by 48 points. Four years later, he won it by 40 points. There’s some evidence that tech workers and executives became more likely to donate to Republicans during the Biden era. But 83 percent of Amazon employees’ donations to federal candidates went to Democrats in 2024; for Meta, that figure was 91.5 percent; for Apple, it was 95 percent. At the megadonor level, the story is a bit more complicated. Trump received more money from tech donors who spent over $1 million on the 2024 race than Harris did — but that’s mostly thanks to Musk’s prodigious giving. Musk spent $242.6 million on the 2024 election, nearly five times as much as Silicon Valley’s second-largest political spender, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, a Democrat. And yet, it’s hard to attribute Musk’s political evolution to recent changes in Democratic policy. The Tesla CEO appears to have been undergoing a process of online radicalization even before Biden took office (in March 2020, Musk allegedly bet the writer Sam Harris $1 million that there would be fewer than 35,000 cases of Covid-19 in the United States, a conviction that seems symptomatic of his immersion in right-wing social media). If we deem Musk a special case and put him to the side, then Democrats retained their advantage with large tech donors in 2024: Combined, all other tech megadonors spent $30.6 million on Trump, and $120.9 million on Harris, according to an analysis from The Guardian. In any case, money was not the Democrats’ problem in 2024. The party and its allied groups outraised the GOP by $1.1 billion during last year’s campaign. To be sure, many Silicon Valley billionaires waited until after Election Day to cozy up to Trump, so their newfound support for the GOP would not be captured by this data. But those who only started currying Trump’s favor once he secured the presidency are likely motivated less by antipathy for Democratic policy than awareness of Republican corruption: Trump has made it quite clear that his friends can expect favorable treatment by his government while his foes can anticipate the opposite. “A number of people in tech led with vinegar during Trump’s first term and learned that it was better with Trump to lead with honey,” Adam Kovacevich, a former Google executive and chair of the Chamber of Progress, told me. “It’s not so much that they expect a lot, but they really don’t want their companies to be hurt by Trump. If your competitors are building a close relationship with Trump, you don’t want them to screw you.” All of which is to say: The Democrats have paid a price for their crusade against Big Tech, but not a prohibitively expensive one. None of this settles the debate over whether Democrats were right to take a more adversarial posture toward the tech industry under Biden. Moderate Democrats can look at this pattern of facts and conclude that Biden’s agenda alienated a powerful industry and did little to increase their party’s popular support, all while discouraging growth and innovation. Progressives, meanwhile, can counter that Democrats just proved they can take on concentrated corporate power and still retain an overwhelming financial advantage over the GOP — and thus, the party has no excuse not to prioritize the interests of ordinary Americans over those of tech billionaires. Ultimately though, the important disagreement here is the substantive one. If Democrats can ingratiate themselves to tech billionaires in ways that have little substantive cost — such as giving them face time or rhetorical encouragement — they might be well-advised to do so. But the party as of yet faces no imperative to abandon policies that benefit the general public, for the sake of appeasing Silicon Valley titans.

And when Kamala Harris announced her support for Biden’s plan last summer, Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists had a conniption. Super-rich tech moguls care about making money. But they are often at least as covetous of social status. Past a certain point, accumulating more wealth has little practical impact on your living standards (or those of your children, or your children’s children). But a person’s appetite for greater prestige tends to be less exhaustible than their desire for beach homes, Porsches, or private jets. Thus, if Democrats had spent the past decade exalting tech investors and founders, it’s possible that the party’s increasingly adversarial policies would have caused less rancor in Silicon Valley. But Democrats became increasingly disillusioned with the tech industry over the course of the 2010s. And this culminated in a Democratic administration that undermined tech billionaires’ sense of self-importance. “At the core level, both Barack Obama and the modal Democrat thought the average Silicon Valley company was really good and cool in 2009,” Marc Aidinoff, a historian and policy adviser in both the Obama and Biden administrations, told me. “Obama would go to Silicon Valley and have dinner with the CEOs and call them champions of change. What these people really wanted from the president was the sense that they were loved.” But by 2021, things had changed, according to Aidinoff. “Joe Biden distrusts these people, thinks they are hurting Americans, and has the sense that they aren’t actually making much of real value,” he said. The Democrats’ disenchantment with tech wasn’t attributable to Biden’s personal skepticism of Silicon Valley alone. After the financial crisis, the party’s progressive wing grew more influential. And its ascent increased the salience of both inequality and labor issues in Democratic politics. For a party increasingly concerned with wealth concentration and workers’ rights, tech giants that generated vast fortunes off “winner-take-all” markets — while, in many cases, committing labor violations or undermining traditional employment — did not look like engines of progress. As importantly, the notion that social media platforms promoted democracy and social reform fell into disrepute. In the wake of Obama’s election and the Arab Spring — both of which were widely credited to novel media technologies — many liberals bought into the idea that Facebook and Twitter would abet a more egalitarian politics. But authoritarian regimes proved adept at restricting online speech. And if social media’s potential to facilitate rightwing extremism wasn’t clear to liberals before 2016, it was apparent to them afterward. Following Trump’s victory, many Democrats blamed their party’s defeat on Facebook’s dissemination of “fake news.” Around the same time, research suggesting that social media could have adverse mental health effects started to accumulate. All this — combined with tech platforms’ adverse impact on traditional journalism — led the mainstream media to view Silicon Valley more critically. Between 2012 and 2019, the New York Times’ coverage of Facebook turned sharply negative, according to one prominent data analysis. Add in Silicon Valley’s growing enthusiasm for crypto — a technology that appeared to be good for little beyond scams and speculation — and it isn’t hard to see why Democrats soured on Big Tech. The party’s newfound skepticism of the industry didn’t just translate into greater regulatory scrutiny, but also, a withholding of both praise and access. According to some in tech, the sector’s leading lights felt themselves shunned and slighted by the Biden White House. “I think the fundamental problem, and I heard this from many, was that former President Biden was unwilling to meet with tech CEOs and entrepreneurs,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me. “It was that simple.” One former Biden official echoed this assessment, saying that tech companies “couldn’t get meetings with a lot of the key regulators. Certainly [FTC commissioner] Lina [Khan] wouldn’t meet with people — she liked to say, ‘We’re enforcement, you can’t really meet with us.’” Andreessen recently reminisced that Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party had “celebrated” and “loved” tech companies. Biden’s Democratic Party, by contrast, often refused Andreessen’s ilk the time of day. It’s clear then that Silicon Valley’s rightward turn was precipitated, at least in part, by a change in the Democratic Party’s attitudes and policies toward the tech industry. And there’s reason to think that the party’s anti-tech turn is politically costly on net. Were other tech billionaires to emulate Musk’s political giving — or other social media companies to imitate X’s boosting of right-wing content — the damage to Democrats could be considerable. And the Trump administration’s manifest openness to trading political power for financial support makes this a live possibility, especially if Democrats promise to reprise the Biden administration’s policies toward the industry. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that aggressively regulating Silicon Valley can gain Democrats meaningful support elsewhere. This is not because voters oppose that general goal: In fact, in a 2024 Pew Research poll, a slight majority expressed support for increasing regulation of the tech industry, while a supermajority said that social media has had a “mostly negative” effect on the United States. The problem is that voters have ambivalent feelings about Big Tech writ large, and do not consider regulating the companies a priority. When Gallup asked Americans what their country’s most important problem was this month, only 1 percent named “corporate corruption” while 0 percent picked “technology.” In a post-election survey from Morning Consult and the Chamber of Progress (a trade group of companies allied with the Democratic Party), voters were presented with a list of 12 issues, and asked to name the two that were most important to their vote. Only 2 percent of respondents picked “regulating technology companies” as one of their priorities, making it the single least prioritized objective on the list (by contrast, 49 percent selected “controlling inflation and strengthening the economy”). Meanwhile, in YouGov’s polling, Amazon’s approval rating sits at 74 percent, Google’s at 70 percent, Apple’s at 69 percent, and Facebook at 59 percent. Given all this, it’s plausible that Democrats have more to lose than gain politically from taking on Big Tech. Yet it’s also true that the political costs of the party’s anti-tech turn have been routinely overstated. In truth, Silicon Valley’s rightward shift — while real — has been remarkably modest, whether measured in votes or donations. In 2020, Biden won Santa Clara County, which includes much of Silicon Valley, by 48 points. Four years later, he won it by 40 points. There’s some evidence that tech workers and executives became more likely to donate to Republicans during the Biden era. But 83 percent of Amazon employees’ donations to federal candidates went to Democrats in 2024; for Meta, that figure was 91.5 percent; for Apple, it was 95 percent. At the megadonor level, the story is a bit more complicated. Trump received more money from tech donors who spent over $1 million on the 2024 race than Harris did — but that’s mostly thanks to Musk’s prodigious giving. Musk spent $242.6 million on the 2024 election, nearly five times as much as Silicon Valley’s second-largest political spender, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, a Democrat. And yet, it’s hard to attribute Musk’s political evolution to recent changes in Democratic policy. The Tesla CEO appears to have been undergoing a process of online radicalization even before Biden took office (in March 2020, Musk allegedly bet the writer Sam Harris $1 million that there would be fewer than 35,000 cases of Covid-19 in the United States, a conviction that seems symptomatic of his immersion in right-wing social media). If we deem Musk a special case and put him to the side, then Democrats retained their advantage with large tech donors in 2024: Combined, all other tech megadonors spent $30.6 million on Trump, and $120.9 million on Harris, according to an analysis from The Guardian. In any case, money was not the Democrats’ problem in 2024. The party and its allied groups outraised the GOP by $1.1 billion during last year’s campaign. To be sure, many Silicon Valley billionaires waited until after Election Day to cozy up to Trump, so their newfound support for the GOP would not be captured by this data. But those who only started currying Trump’s favor once he secured the presidency are likely motivated less by antipathy for Democratic policy than awareness of Republican corruption: Trump has made it quite clear that his friends can expect favorable treatment by his government while his foes can anticipate the opposite. “A number of people in tech led with vinegar during Trump’s first term and learned that it was better with Trump to lead with honey,” Adam Kovacevich, a former Google executive and chair of the Chamber of Progress, told me. “It’s not so much that they expect a lot, but they really don’t want their companies to be hurt by Trump. If your competitors are building a close relationship with Trump, you don’t want them to screw you.” All of which is to say: The Democrats have paid a price for their crusade against Big Tech, but not a prohibitively expensive one. None of this settles the debate over whether Democrats were right to take a more adversarial posture toward the tech industry under Biden. Moderate Democrats can look at this pattern of facts and conclude that Biden’s agenda alienated a powerful industry and did little to increase their party’s popular support, all while discouraging growth and innovation. Progressives, meanwhile, can counter that Democrats just proved they can take on concentrated corporate power and still retain an overwhelming financial advantage over the GOP — and thus, the party has no excuse not to prioritize the interests of ordinary Americans over those of tech billionaires. Ultimately though, the important disagreement here is the substantive one. If Democrats can ingratiate themselves to tech billionaires in ways that have little substantive cost — such as giving them face time or rhetorical encouragement — they might be well-advised to do so. But the party as of yet faces no imperative to abandon policies that benefit the general public, for the sake of appeasing Silicon Valley titans.

Title: Apple's iPhone sales during the holiday season slipped despite a highly anticipated AI rollout

Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company’s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company’s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses. The iPhone’s roughly 1% drop in revenue from the previous year’s October-December period wasn’t entirely unexpected, given the first software update enabling the device’s AI features didn’t arrive until just before Halloween, and the technology still isn’t available in many markets outside the U.S. The countries still awaiting Apple’s AI suite include China, a key market where the company continued to lose ground. Apple also was only able to eke out a modest revenue gain across its entire business, although the results came in ahead of the analyst projections that guide investors. The Cupertino, California, company earned $36.3 billion, or $2.40 per share, a 7% increase from the previous year. Revenue edged up from the previous year by 4% to $124.3 billion. Those numbers included iPhone revenue of $69.1 billion. In China, Apple’s total revenue registered $18.5 billion, an 11% decrease from the previous year. Part of that erosion in China reflected the iPhone’s shrinking market share in that country, where homegrown companies have been making more headway. Apple’s iPhone year-over year shipments in China declined nearly 10% in the most recent quarter, while native companies Huawei and Xiaomi posted year-over-year increase of more than 20%, according to the research firm International Data Corp. The holiday-season results served to confirm bringing AI to the iPhone and Apple’s other products may not boost the company’s recently lackluster growth as much as investors initially thought it might after CEO Tim Cook unveiled the technology before a rapt crowd last June. The anticipation that an AI-infused iPhone would prod hordes of consumers to ditch their current devices and splurge on an upgrade is the main reason Apple’s stock price surged by 30% last year. But the sinking realization that an uptick in demand may take longer than expected has caused Apple’s shares to backtrack by 5% during the first month of the new year. The stock slipped slightly in extended trading after the numbers came out. The concerns hovering around Apple's weakening iPhone sales come against broader worries about whether AI will be as lucrative for U.S. tech companies as once envisioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a version of the technology that was built at a far lower cost than had been previously thought possible. Unlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook corporate parent Meta Platforms, Apple hasn’t been investing as heavily in AI – one of the reasons it has been an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek’s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum. Apple’s services division remained the company’s biggest moneymaker outside the iPhone, with revenue of $26.3 billion in the past quarter, a 14% increase from the previous year. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it generates more than $20 billion annually by locking in Google as the automatic search engine on the iPhone and other products. That deal is now under threat of being banned as part of the proposed punishment for Google’s search engine being declared an illegal monopoly. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Apple Reports Record $124.3 Billion Revenue on Strong Holiday Sales
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/apple-earnings-q1/
Time Published: 2025-01-30T21:44:35Z

The tech giant offset a modest iPhone sales dip with strong results from Europe, subscriptions and iCloud Apple reported the company’s best quarterly sales ever on Thursday, with the tech giant pointing to a strong holiday performance leading to $124.3 billion in Q1 revenue. The company posted the big quarter despite declining sales in China and a minor dip in iPhone revenue. Apple offset its sales drop in China with an 11.4% year-over-year increase in European sales, as well as 14% annual growth from Apple’s Services sector, which includes Apple TV+, Apple Music, and iCloud storage. Those gains also helped Apple weather flat sales from its Wearables division, which accounts for Apple Watch, headphones, and its Vision Pro virtual reality headsets. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a statement accompanying earnings, announced Apple Intelligence — the company’s artificial intelligence program designed to help users with messages, notifications, and other features — would “be available in even more languages this April,” without providing further details. Here are the top-line numbers from Apple’s first quarter, which represents its October through December performance: Revenues: $124.3 billion, a 4% increase from the year prior. Apple’s Q1 sales narrowly topped analyst estimates from Zack’s Investment Research of $124 billion. The Q1 performance also topped Apple’s previous record of $123.9 billion in sales during the holiday quarter of 2021. Apple’s sales in China, notably, dropped 11% year-over-year to $18.5 billion. Cook explained the dip on the call by saying it was due to a “change in channel inventory,” or products that are in the supply chain but have not been sold yet. He also said China is the “most competitive market in the world” and that, moving forward, he believes recent government stimulus packages will help some of Apple’s products in the next quarter. The company made up for it in Europe, its second biggest market, where Apple had $33.9 billion in Q1 revenue — an 11.4% year-over-year increase. Net income: $36.3 billion, up 7.1% from last year’s $33.9 billion. Earnings Per Share: Apple’s diluted earnings per share of $2.4o were better than Zack’s estimates of $2.36 EPS. iPhone Sales: Revenue from Apple’s linchpin device declined 0.8% annually to $69.1 billion. Apple brought in nearly $70 billion from iPhone sales a year ago. Services: Apple’s wide-ranging Services sector accounted for $26.3 billion in sales, compared to the $23.1 billion brought in a year ago. As is usually the case, Apple did not mention how its streaming service, Apple TV+, was performing in its quarterly report, though on its earnings call Cook did express enthusiasm about several of its upcoming shows. This was the best quarter ever for Services sales. Cook was in Washington, D.C. last week for President Trump’s inauguration, where he was joined by a number of other Big Tech CEOs, including X owner Elon Musk, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Cook’s appearance came after he personally donated $1 million towards Trump’s inauguration fund. Heading into Thursday, Apple’s stock price had increased a modest 3.5% since the start of October. The company’s holiday quarter coincided with the October launch of Apple Intelligence; the rollout was met with tepid reviews, and has led to questions from some analysts about Apple’s future in a crowded AI space. Apple is the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.57 trillion. Microsoft, with a valuation of $3.09 trillion, is the next closest company. Cook, on the Q1 earnings call on Thursday afternoon, said Apple now had 2.35 billion active devices worldwide — yet another company record. The 64-year-old executive also took a moment to extend his condolences to those affected by the “devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area.” There was not much mentioned about Apple’s entertainment push, beyond Cook mentioning the recent return of “Severance” and the upcoming “Formula One” film starring Brad Pitt.

The Dow and other major indices edged higher following earnings reports from tech giants Tesla (TSLA-6.07%), Meta (META+2.03%), and Microsoft (MSFT-0.16%). However, AI stock Nvidia (NVDA-2.79%) dropped another 2%, continuing its decline after it was hit hard by the launch of DeepSeek’s efficient-yet-thrifty AI model. By the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained about 240 points, or 0.54%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 rose by 0.18% and 0.53%, respectively. Meanwhile, the latest report on U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) showed the economy grew at a 2.3% annualized, inflation-adjusted rate in the fourth quarter. This was slightly below economists’ expectations of a 2.5% increase. Investors are also awaiting earnings reports from Apple (AAPL-3.41%), set to be released after the closing bell, along with financial updates from payment giants Mastercard (MA+1.36%) and Visa (V+0.78%). Tesla (TSLA-6.07%) shares rose despite fourth-quarter revenue and other metrics falling short of Wall Street expectations. The Austin, Texas-based electric vehicle maker reported fourth-quarter revenue of $25.7 billion, up 2% compared to last year’s $25.2 billion. But analysts had expected $27.2 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-0.31%). Automotive revenue fell by 8% during the September to December quarter to $19.8 billion, but it still accounted for the vast majority of Tesla’s income. Sales grew year-over-year but failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations and push Tesla over the finish line to reach its goal of 1.8 million units sold, which would have matched 2023's deliveries. —William Gavin contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Per the memo, these cuts appear related to Amazon’s controversial return to office policy. In September, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy notified employees that they would be expected to return to the office five days per week beginning in 2025, but the decision sparked blowback from employees. “We identified some roles that were too narrowly scoped or that introduced unnecessary layers, where we couldn’t solve the challenge by flattening the structure or shifting workloads,” wrote SVP Drew Herdener in the memo seen by TechCrunch. “To address this and do the right thing for the business, we’re eliminating a small number of roles in Communications and Sustainability.” Herdener referenced a recent meeting with Jassy, where the CEO said that reducing company headcount was not a goal of reorganizing the workforce; Herdener claims that the overall headcount of his department will remain unchanged once Amazon rehires for some of these roles at lower levels. When reached by TechCrunch, Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser declined to tell TechCrunch how many jobs were eliminated. The laid off employees will receive “financial support, benefit continuation, and job placement assistance,” per the memo. These cuts in sustainability and corporate responsibility roles come less than two weeks after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had a close-up seat at the inauguration, sitting close behind Trump and alongside other tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Sergey Brin. Bezos, like other prominent tech founders, donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. The layoffs at Amazon stem from a restructuring project that began before Trump’s election. But the relationship between Bezos and the new administration could be a harbinger of future corporate moves at Amazon. Since Trump took office, Amazon has already canceled some diversity and inclusion initiatives, which have also been targeted by the new administration. Trump’s administration has already reversed sustainability initiatives at a federal level. So far, the president has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty addressing climate change. He even declared a national emergency in order to promote the production of fossil fuels, as opposed to more sustainable energy sources. Updated to include Amazon’s decline.

Title: CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) Hits Record Highs After DeepSeek Cyber-Attack Boosts Cybersecurity Sentiment

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News and Ratings Shaking Up Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against the other AI stocks. Technological innovations in steam power, electricity and microprocessors drove the first industrial revolution. Fast forward, artificial intelligence is the catalyst driving the fourth industrial revolution. That’s because the technology is reshaping industries at a breakneck speed. From revolutionizing the healthcare sector to addressing cybersecurity challenges to reshaping the auto industry, technology is reshaping the way of life in ways not seen before. According to Markets and Markets, the global AI market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 35.7% to $1.3 trillion by 2030. Significant advancements in computational power and data availability are the factors expected to accelerate the growth. Similarly, revolutionary technology is giving rise to unique investment opportunities as companies compete against time to develop game-changing innovations and enhance productivity. The $500 billion Stargate project is one such investment that sums up the enormous sums of money that companies are willing to spend to gain an edge on AI. While most of the investments are going to data centers and other infrastructures, companies are also inking deals and partnerships to secure reliable energy to power AI models and infrastructure. The companies that provide the metaphorical picks and shovels of artificial intelligence, the manufacturers of semiconductors, servers, networking gear, and power generators—have seen a sharp increase in stock prices as a result of the spending frenzy. The tremendous opportunity up for grabs is evident due to the blockbuster gains in the equity markets over the past two years. Major US indices are trading near all-time highs. While deep pullbacks have come into play in recent months, Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities remains bullish about the AI-driven rally. Ives dismissed the recent tech stock sell-off caused by DeepSeek as a "tech AI head fake" and believes that investors have a "golden buying opportunity" with it. Ives claims that the fear surrounding the low-cost, high-performance model of the Chinese AI company is exaggerated and won't affect the AI revolution's long-term course. "This DeepSeek tech-driven sell-off will be historically noteworthy in market history," Ives wrote, emphasizing that it does not reflect a genuine threat to AI spending trends. "We expect more innovation in AI and LLM model costs to come down... that is ultimately a great thing for computing power, use cases, and where the tech world is going in this 4th Industrial Revolution." President Donald Trump has already reiterated that DeepSeek is a “wake-up call” for the U.S. tech industry, insisting the sector should be laser-focused on computing if the US is to maintain its edge on the technology. In an attempt to keep American businesses from lagging behind their Chinese counterparts, Wall Street thinks DeepSeek's success will encourage the US government to increase its investment in AI. “In the near term, DeepSeek’s achievement is likely to pressure the U.S. into increased support for domestic AI development, most likely leading to increased federal investment in AI research and infrastructure,” wrote Mills of Raymond James. The firm added that it could envision the U.S. passing an AI version of the CHIPS and Science Act. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a software infrastructure company that provides cybersecurity solutions. On January 28th, the stock hit record highs in the market as Chinese artificial intelligence sensation DeepSeek was the subject of a cyber-attack. The attack came a day after the company triggered a massive sell-off in the market on the news that its AI assistant model runs on less advanced chips at a low cost. The DeepSeek cyber-attack news triggered investor enthusiasm in the cybersecurity sector, with CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) emerging as the biggest beneficiary. The 10% rally came a day after CrowdStrike’s Falcon cybersecurity platform achieved a perfect score in a real-world ransomware test. Cybersecurity software testing company SE Labs gave the platform a perfect score, stating that it "stopped all known and unknown threats with no false positives. JMP Securities analysts have reiterated a market outperform rating on the stock with a $400 price target. The bullish rating stems from expectations that CrowdStrike and rival Palo Alto Networks are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that crop up in securing AI infrastructure and data. Overall CRWD ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks that are shaping up Wall Street. While we acknowledge the growth potential of CRWD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRWD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia stock has crossed a red line that points to more pain after this week's DeepSeek rout
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-stock-price-outlook-technical-analysis-deepseek-ai-moving-average-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-30T19:12:16Z

Nvidia stock is on thin ice as it trades below a key technical level for the first time since January 2023. Shares of the graphics processing unit maker have plunged 16% since investors descended into a panic earlier this week over a new AI model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. The drop, which erased nearly $600 billion in Nvidia's market value in a single day, sent the stock to its 200-day moving average. That threshold is a closely watched technical indicator that helps identify the long-term direction of a trend. When securities fall below their 200-day moving average, it warns traders that the prior uptrend in a stock price could be on the verge of reversing course. Nvidia stock closed below its 200-day moving average on Monday, jumped back above it on Tuesday and Wednesday, but then fell back below it during Thursday's trading session. The stock traded at $119.70 on Thursday, below its 200-day moving average of $122.28. The back-and-forth trading above and below the key threshold suggests that Nvidia is trading at make-or-break levels this week. Will Tamplin, a senior analyst at Fairlead Strategies, said the downside price action in Nvidia was a warning of more pain ahead. "NVDA is seeing a hard test of its rising 200-day MA, near $122. We think the correction is likely to deepen further toward secondary support at roughly $110," Tamplin told Business Insider in an email. Tamplin said momentum in Nvidia stock is to the downside in the intermediate term, defined as two to four months, adding that the stock had yet to hit oversold territory, which suggests more downside ahead. "From a long-term perspective, momentum has fallen off since mid-2024, meaning that the primary uptrend is likely to become shallower or turn into a trading range environment for 2025," Tamplin wrote. David Keller, the chief strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, told BI that the breakdown in Nvidia was significant considering that the stock had been in a trading range since early November. Keller said it's a concerning sign that there had been no immediate "buy the dip" activity in Nvidia stock since Monday's sharp decline. "Instead of an influx of buyers pushing NVDA back into the consolidation range, we've instead seen the price remain generally within the range of Monday's action," Keller wrote. "Until and unless NVDA can regain the $130 level, we would consider this chart guilty until proven innocent." Ari Wald, the head of technical analysis research at Oppenheimer & Co., said Nvidia stock was unlikely to enter an immediate downtrend, nor likely to resume its two-year uptrend. Instead, Wald told BI that the stock should enter a sideways consolidation phase going forward. "Typically, reversals out of a strong uptrend transition into a range rather than a downtrend meaning continued oscillations around the stock's flattening 200-day average would be reasonable over the coming weeks to months," Wald said via email. Wald is watching $140 as a resistance level for the stock, as well as $100 for a level of support. While he ultimately expects Nvidia to resume its uptrend in the long term "based on what we see as middle-innings, growth-led, secular advance," Wald said, it makes sense for investors to wait for the uptrend to come back before buying the stock. "A sidelines approach makes sense while the stock works off prior excesses through the balance of the current cycle," Wald said. And while Nvidia's decline this week has been significant, it's masking underlying strength in the broader market, Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist at Carson Group, said. "The bar is set quite high and these names need to report strong earnings to justify the current valuation," Detrick told BI, referring to Nvidia and some other chip-related stocks. "But at the end of the day, rotation is the lifeblood of a bull market and to see rotation out of chips and into things like transports and financials" might not be "the worst thing," he added. Nvidia will get a chance to prove to investors that it's worthy of its premium valuation when it reports earnings after the market close on February 26. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Faces Securities Class Action After Weight Loss Therapy Trial Data Disappoints, Analyst Questions Trial’s Design – Hagens Berman

January 30, 2025 14:12 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT?

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks That Are Being Monitored By Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against other top AI stocks that are being monitored by Wall Street. As the global tech sector was catching up to the disruption caused by DeepSeek’s r1 AI model, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced its brand new Qwen 2.5 AI model on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The Qwen 2.5 is pre-trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal data and rivals DeepSeek’s AI model. “Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms … almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-3.1-405B,” the group’s cloud unit on its official WeChat account. The latest Chinese AI model release also sent US firms scrambling to innovate and stay ahead of the competition. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently teased several “exciting new features” coming to ChatGPT and a new ChatGPT Gov tool to bolster ties with the US government. The rise of advanced, cost-effective Chinese AI models has introduced volatility in US stocks as analysts rampantly rerate companies and shift outlooks based on the rapidly evolving tech landscape. We selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a mobility Software-as-a-Service company that connects riders with drivers, offers food delivery and grocery shopping services, and integrates public transport in over 70 countries. The company has continually invested in AI over the past decade, and the tech is now a critical part of company operations. It uses AI and ML to improve ETA predictions, pricing, risk assessments, customer service, the company’s internal productivity, and overall business operations. On January 28th, BofA analyst Justin Post marginally trimmed Uber Technologies Inc.’s (NYSE:UBER) stock price target to $93 from $96 but retained a “Buy” rating. The brokerage believes the company’s current valuation “seems to reflect a big AV overhang.” However, analysts see opportunities for multiple expansions based on steady growth and margin improvement this year, combined with a “stable-to-improving” autonomous vehicle narrative. Overall, UBER ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks that are being monitored by Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other top trending AI stocks on latest news. The bloodbath that triggered one of the biggest routs in US stock markets appears to be under control. Even as people across China hail the success of their homegrown tech startup DeepSeek, it’s becoming increasingly clear there is room for everyone in the artificial intelligence race. That’s the sentiment echoed across the board as it becomes clear markets might have overreacted on reports China is at the forefront of developing AI models at the lowest costs possible. A day after US stocks came under pressure amid the DeepSeek revelations, developers at leading US AI firms have already started praising DeepSeek AI models, touting them as Sputnik models. Some AI experts praised DeepSeek’s robust team and state-of-the-art research, but they were unconcerned by the development as concerns about competition rippled through the U.S. stock market. “The dust is now settling after Monday’s long overdue AI reckoning, and while we still believe in the AI-driven productivity story, investing in this sector going forward may not be as easy as it was over the past two years,” said Emily Bowersock Hill at Bowersock Capital Partners. “We expect investors to be more discerning and selective when it comes to AI investing.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X that R1, one of DeepSeek’s models, “is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” Nvidia also echoed the sentiments, stating DeepSeek’s achievement proved the need for more of its chips. According to US President Donald Trump, the release of DeepSeek’s AI models should be a wake-up call on the need to be laser-focused on competing to win. The sentiments come from the Hype around the new AI models triggering over $1 trillion in US and European tech stocks. The sentiments come at the backdrop of reports that AI presents a $15 trillion opportunity over the next few years, given the transformation it is poised to bring in various sectors. Therefore, there is room for every company to leverage technology to strengthen its competitive edge. Barclays has already reiterated that companies offering advanced AI services are well poised to benefit from the availability of cost-effective AI models. In contrast, companies working on expensive hardware needed to enable and power AI should remain under scrutiny if DeepSeek’s revelations that it’s possible to develop AI models using common or cheap chips are anything to go by.

Title: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Going “DeepSeek”
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/ai-going-deepseek/5878642
Time Published: 2025-01-30T16:18:05Z

Most readers will know the news by now. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, released an AI model called R1 that is comparable in ability to the best models from companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta, but was trained at a radically lower cost and using less than state-of-the art GPU chips. DeepSeek also made public enough of the details of the model that others can run it on their own computers without charge. DeepSeek is a torpedo that has hit the Magnificent Seven US hi-tech companies below the water line. DeepSeek did not use the latest and best Nvidia’s chips and software; it did not require huge spending on training its AI model unlike its American rivals; and it offers just as many useful applications. DeepSeek built its R1 with Nvidia’s older, slower chips, which US sanctions had allowed to be exported to China. The US government and the tech titans thought they had a monopoly in AI development because of the huge costs involved in making better chips and AI models. But now DeepSeek’s R1 suggests that companies with less money can soon operate competitive AI models. R1 can be used on a shoestring budget and with much less computing power. Moreover, R1 is just as good as rivals at ‘inference’, the AI jargon for when users question the model and get answers. And it runs on servers for all sorts of companies so that they need not ‘rent’ at huge prices from the likes of OpenAI. Most important, DeepSeek’s R1 is ‘open source’, namely that is coding and training methods are open to all to copy and develop. This is a real blow to the ‘proprietary’ secrets that OpenAI or Google’s Gemini lock away in a ‘black box’ in order to maximise profits. The analogy here is with branded and generic pharmaceuticals. The big issue for the US AI companies and their investors is that it appears that building huge data centres to house multiples of expensive chips may not be necessary in order to achieve sufficiently successful outcomes. Up to now, the US companies have been ratcheting up huge spending plans and trying to raise mega amounts of funding to do so. Indeed, on the very Monday that DeepSeek’s R1 hit the news, Meta announced another $65bn of investment, and only days earlier President Trump announced government subsidies of $500bn to the tech giants as part of the so-called Stargate project. Ironically, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said he was investing because “We want the US to set the global AI standard, not China.” Oh dear. . . Now investors are concerned that this spending is unnecessary and, more to the point, that it will hit the profitability of the American companies if DeepSeek can deliver AI applications at a tenth of the cost. Five of the biggest technology stocks geared to AI — chipmaker Nvidia and so-called ‘hyperscalers’ Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms — collectively shed almost $750bn of their stock market value in one day. And DeepSeek does threaten the profits of the data centre companies and the water and power operators which expect to benefit from the huge ‘scaling up’ by the Magnificent Seven. The US stock market boom is heavily concentrated in the ‘Magnificent Seven’. . . So has DeepSeek punctured the massive stock market bubble in US tech stocks? Billionaire investor Ray Dalio thinks so. He told the Financial Times that “pricing has got to levels which are high at the same time as there’s an interest rate risk, and that combination could prick the bubble … Where we are in the cycle right now is very similar to where we were between 1998 or 1999,” Dalio said. “In other words, there’s a major new technology that certainly will change the world and be successful. But some people are confusing that with the investments being successful.” . . But that may not be the case, at least not just yet. The AI chip company Nvidia’s stock price may have dived this week, but its ‘proprietary’ coding language, Cuda, is still the US industry standard. While its shares dropped nearly 17%, that only brings it back to the (very, very high) level of September. . . Much will depend on other factors like the US Fed keeping interest rates high because of a reversal in the fall in inflation and on whether Trump proceeds big time with his tariff and immigration threats that will only fuel inflation. What must enrage the tech oligarchs sucking up to Trump is that US sanctions on Chinese companies and bans on chip exports have not stopped China making yet more advances in the tech and chip war with the US. China is managing to make technological leaps in AI despite export controls introduced by the Biden administration intended to deprive it of both the most powerful chips and the advanced tools needed to make them. Chinese tech champion Huawei has emerged as Nvidia’s primary competitor in China for ‘inference’ chips. And it has been working with AI companies, including DeepSeek, to adapt models trained on Nvidia GPUs to run inference on its Ascend chips. “Huawei is getting better. They have an opening as the government is telling the big tech companies that they need to buy their chips and use them for inference,” said one semiconductor investor in Beijing. This is a further demonstration that state-led planned investment into technology and tech skills by China works so much better than relying on huge private tech giants led by moguls. As Ray Dallo said: “In our system, by and large, we are moving to a more industrial-complex- type of policy in which there is going to be government-mandated and government-influenced activity, because it is so important…Capitalism alone — the profit motive alone — cannot win this battle.” Nevertheless, the AI titans are not yet the titanic. They are going ahead with ‘scaling up’ by ploughing yet more and more billions into data centres and more advanced chips. This eating up computer power exponentially. . . And of course, there is no consideration of what mainstream economists politely like to call ‘externalities’. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, a ChatGPT query needs nearly 10 times as much electricity as a Google search query. Researcher Jesse Dodge did some back-of-the-napkin math on the amount of energy AI chatbots use. “One query to ChatGPT uses approximately as much electricity as could light one light bulb for about 20 minutes,” he says. “So, you can imagine with millions of people using something like that every day, that adds up to a really large amount of electricity.” More electricity consumption means more energy production and in particular more fossil-fuelled greenhouse gas emissions. Google has the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2030. Since 2007, the company has said its company operations were carbon neutral because of the carbon offsets it buys to match its emissions. But, starting in 2023, Google wrote in its sustainability report that it was no longer “maintaining operational carbon neutrality.” The company says it’s still pushing for its net-zero goal in 2030. “Google’s real motivation here is to build the best AI systems that they can,” Dodge says. “And they’re willing to pour a ton of resources into that, including things like training AI systems on bigger and bigger data centers all the way up to supercomputers, which incurs a tremendous amount of electricity consumption and therefore CO2 emissions.” Then there’s water. As the US faces droughts and wildfires, the AI companies are sucking up deep water to ‘cool’ their mega data centres to protect the chips. More than that, Silicon Valley companies are increasingly taking control of water supply infrastructure to meet their needs. Research suggests, for instance, that about 700,000 litres of water could have been used to cool the machines that trained ChatGPT-3 at Microsoft’s data facilities. Training AI models consumes 6,000 times more energy than a European city. Furthermore, while minerals such as lithium and cobalt are most commonly associated with batteries in the motor sector, they are also crucial for the batteries used in datacentres. The extraction process often involves significant water usage and can lead to pollution, undermining water security. Sam Altman, the previous non-profit hero of Open AI, but now out to maximise profits for Microsoft, argues that yes, unfortunately there are ‘trade-offs’ in the short term, but they’re necessary to reach so-called AGI; and AGI will then help us solve all these problems so the trade off of ‘externalities’ is worth it. AGI? What’s this? Artifical generalised intelligence (AGI) is the holy grail of AI developers. It means that AI models would become ‘superintelligent’ way above human intelligence. When that is achieved, Altman promises, its AI won’t just be able to do a single worker’s job, it will be able to do all of their jobs: “AI can do the work of an organization.” This would be the ultimate in maximising profitability by doing away with workers in companies (even AI companies?) as AI machines take over operating, developing and marketing everything. This is the apocalyptic dream for capital (but a nightmare for labour: no job, no income). That’s why Altman and the other AI moguls will not stop expanding their data centres and developing yet more advanced chips just because DeepSeek has undercut their current models. Research firm Rosenblatt forecast the response of the tech giants: “In general, we expect the bias to be on improved capability, sprinting faster towards artificial general intelligence, more than reduced spending.” Nothing must stop the objective of super-intelligent AI. Some see the race to achieving AGI as a threat to humanity itself. Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, said “Even the CEOs who are engaging in the race have stated that whoever wins has a significant probability of causing human extinction in the process, because we have no idea how to control systems more intelligent than ourselves,” he said. “In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff.” Maybe, but I continue to doubt that human ‘intelligence’ can be replaced by machine intelligence, mainly because they are different. Machines cannot think of potential and qualitative changes. New knowledge comes from such transformations (human), not from the extension of existing knowledge (machines). Only human intelligence is social and can see the potential for change, in particular social change, that leads to a better life for humanity and nature. What DeepSeek’s emergence has shown is that AI can be developed to a level that can help humanity and its social needs. It’s free and open and available to the smallest user and developer. It has not been developed at a profit or to make a profit. As one commentator put it: “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.” Managers are introducing AI to “make management problems easier at the cost of the stuff that many people don’t think AI should be used for, like creative work….. If AI is going to work, it needs to come from the bottom-up, or AI is going to be useless for the vast majority of people in the workplace”. Rather than develop AI to make profits, reduce jobs and the livelihoods of humans, AI under common ownership and planning could reduce the hours of human labour for all and free humans from toil to concentrate on creative work that only human intelligence can deliver. Remember the ‘holy grail’ was a Victorian fiction and later a Dan Brown one as well. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Microsoft, AWS, and Cerebras launch DeepSeek R1 model
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/366618674/Microsoft-AWS-and-Cerebras-launch-DeepSeek-R1-model
Time Published: 2025-01-30T15:43:00Z
Full Content:
Nabugu - stock.adobe.com Enterprises that want to test DeepSeek-R1, the Chinese reasoning model that caused a tsunami in the tech industry, can get it from cloud providers AWS and Microsoft, the online platform GitHub and hardware maker Cerebras Systems. The tech companies made the model from Hangzhou, China-based AI startup DeepSeek available this week, just days after it rocked the tech industry by casting doubt on the high cost of running AI in the United States. The model is comparable to OpenAI's o1 but requires a fraction of the GPU power, according to its developers. "DeepSeek-R1 is certainly having its viral moment now," said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran. Chandrasekaran said he expects many companies to offer DeepSeek-R1, including variants for specific industries and cloud, data center and edge deployments. Model providers will likely differentiate themselves from competitors by offering better performance for the price through infrastructure innovations, Chandrasekaran said. They will also provide security and privacy layers and guarantees around legal indemnification. "Having said that, in a few months, we may not remember R1 as much as we do today," Chandrasekaran said. "There is now a race to build models with better efficiencies, and we will see more such models from large cloud providers in the U.S., China, as well as from AI research labs in the world." Microsoft made DeepSeek-R1 available on GitHub and the model catalog on Azure AI Foundry. The Foundry offers developers tools to experiment with, iterate on and integrate the model's capabilities into workflows. It also provides security and model evaluation tools. AWS offers its version of DeepSeek on its SageMaker platform for building, training and deploying custom models. AWS customers can train DeepSeek on SageMaker using the Hugging Face open source platform. "We expect to see many more models like this -- both large and small, proprietary and open source -- excel at different tasks," AWS said in an emailed statement. Cerebras Systems introduced AI hardware running a 70-billion-parameter DeepSeek-R1 powered by the company's WSE-2 processor. The preview technology is contained in Cerebras' flagship CS-3 system, a unit that fits within a standard data center rack. Cerebras claims DeepSeek-R1-70B is faster, more accurate, and less expensive than OpenAI's o1 reasoning model. Cerebras trained its model on the same data used to train Llama 3.3 using knowledge distillation, a technique that transfers data from a large, complex model to a smaller, more efficient one. The price of the DeepSeek system will be similar to Cerebras hardware running Llama 3.3 70B. Cerebras has developed a framework called Cerebras Planning and Optimization to enhance the reasoning abilities of Llama 3.3 Cerebras declined to provide pricing details or say how many of its WSE-2 processors are used to run Llama and DeepSeek. Hagay Lupesko, vice president of software engineering at Cerebras, said the company has received many queries from U.S. companies interested in its DeepSeek model. "We have a pretty long list of preview customers who are in line for access to the model," Lupesko said. He declined to name any organizations but said many were in the consumer industry and interested in using the model for application development. Cerebras also used the Llama 3.3 weights to train its version of DeepSeek. Weights are the numerical patterns critical to a model's ability to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data. That means its DeepSeek model doesn't have the output restrictions of the original Chinese model, which, for example, does not answer queries about the Chinese leader, President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek developed and released its model to the open source community. However, some components are inaccessible, and the company did not release the data used to train the model. Hugging Face and Llama creator Meta are attempting to reverse engineer the technology. The company's researchers shook the tech world after they published a research paper demonstrating how they trained the model on significantly less-powerful Nvidia GPUs than the ones used for Open AI's reasoning model o1, yet achieved similar results. The disclosure raised serious questions about the efficiency of U.S.-made models and whether spending tens of billions of dollars on Nvidia's top chips was necessary. On Monday, Nvidia lost $589 billion in market value due to the research paper and release of DeepSeek's R1 model. The company's stock has regained some, though not all, of its losses.

lead not to glory but to hubris, which beckons Nemesis. While everyone was busy reassuring themselves the stock market was still A-OK, the driver of the market--the AI fad--just burned to the waterline. Yes, the current euphoric expectations for AI are a fad, the latest in the endless stream of "gotta have" status signifiers and cultural frenzies. The core dynamic in all fads is Human Wetware 1.0. Though we glorify our individuality--The primacy of the Individual is the key characteristic of Modernity--we remain a herd animal, alert to every twitch in the herd's emotional state and anxious to join the herd when it starts running, lest we're left behind or lose status. CEOs are just as prone to fads as the rest of us, and this is how the AI fad gathered momentum. A decade ago the warm-and-fuzzy tech fad that enamored every corporate HQ was fuzzy logic, one of the long line of precursors to the current AI mania. So labels touting "fuzzy logic" were slapped on rice cookers as everyone scrambled to cash in on the latest tech fad. And so now every package of Kroika Cookies is emblazoned with "powered by AI!" Indeed. The leaders of the herd are especially keen to study every shift in the zeitgeist and the pecking order, as the greatest sin for CEOs is to be revealed as incompetent / clueless by missing the latest boat in corporate fads. Here is one example of the catastrophic consequences not of missing the boat but of blindly climbing on board. On a flight to Shanghai in May 2000, shortly after the NASDAQ dot-com bubble had peaked, my seatmate was a senior engineer working for a Silicon Valley semiconductor equipment maker. Over the course of the long flight, he recounted the domino-like chain of disastrous results of the CEO jumping on the "gotta offshore production" fad that was sweeping through Corporate America. The net result of moving production to Southeast Asia and China was 1) the wholesale theft of intellectual property (IP) and 2) the collapse of quality, requiring technicians to be flown in to fix all the quality problems. But to not move production overseas would have been perceived as "missing the boat," so everyone rushed to join the thundering herd, whether it made any sense or not. The second dynamic in play now is this: monopolies don't care about efficiency or quality, as the user / consumer has no real alternative. The tech world is brimming with stories of corporate wealth being squandered on teams developing efficiencies that are shelved upon completion. The more money gushing into the corporate coffers, the less interest there is in efficiencies. Keeping the Good Ship Status Quo on course is good enough--until the Status Quo burns to the waterline. Then the scramble is to cover the disastrous mis-allocation of corporate capital and identify the next fad to join. The third dynamic is: this isn't about one company. It's about a toolbox that's already infected the entire tech world. It doesn't matter if DeepSeek disappears tomorrow: the toolbox of software structures they've released has already entered the bloodstream of global tech and has already transformed the DNA. There's no going back to brute-force processing as any sort of competitive advantage. Rather, it's a cost anchor that will drag any denialist laggards to the bottom. The fourth dynamic is: there's nothing investable in this disruption because everyone can now develop the same open-source tools and approaches. there is no monopolistic moat to guarantee profits, and no revenue stream to milk. Rather, like deploying billions of dollars on data farms to improve search, there is no revenue at all. Nobody's paying a single dollar for AI enhanced search. As I've noted before, when the tools and techniques are freely available to all, there's no scarcity value to any of it. And with no scarcity value--no value proposition so mighty that people will pay a premium for it--then profits are thin to zero. The "smart money" has noted the AI fad has burned to the waterline, and has been frantically assuring "dumb money" that the stock market bubble is still intact and poised to bubble higher, so there's no reason to sell, and every reason to "buy the dip" so the "smart money" can sell, sell, sell near the top and let the "dumb money" absorb the coming 80% decline as a fad that was poorly conceived from the start has burned to the waterline, and the tiniest wave will send it to the bottom. The "safe bet" was on heavily moated tech behemoths dumping billions of dollars into the "competitive advantage" of energy-ravenous processing power. That "safe bet" is now in Davy Jones' Locker. The reality that "AI has no revenues and no profits" is lingering above the burned-out hulk as a haze of doubt and confusion. What's the next fad? Stay tuned. It might just be a retro revival of the time-tested fad for cost-cutting and "return to basics," starting with mass layoffs and slashing capex budgets.

Title: AI #101: The Shallow End
URL: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pZ6htFtoptGrSajWG/ai-101-the-shallow-end
Time Published: 2025-01-30T14:50:10Z
Full Content:
The avalanche of DeepSeek news continues. We are not yet spending more than a few hours at a time in the singularity, where news happens faster than it can be processed. But it’s close, and I’ve had to not follow a bunch of other non-AI things that are also happening, at least not well enough to offer any insights. So this week we’re going to consider China, DeepSeek and r1 fully split off from everything else, and we’ll cover everything related to DeepSeek, including the policy responses to the situation, tomorrow instead. This is everything else in AI from the past week. Some of it almost feels like it is from another time, so long ago. I’m afraid you’re going to need to get used to that feeling. Also, I went on Odd Lots to discuss DeepSeek, where I was and truly hope to again be The Perfect Guest. Joe Weisenthal finally tries out Google Flash Deep Thinking, is impressed. AI tutors beat out active learning classrooms in a Harvard study by a good margin, for classes like physics and economics. Koratkar gives Operator a shot at a makeshift level similar to Montezuma’s Revenge. Nate Silver estimates his productivity is up 5% from LLMs so far, and warns others that they ignore LLMs at their peril, both politically and personally. Fix all your transcript errors. LLMs are good at transforming text into less text, but yet good at transforming less text into more text. Note that this rule applies to English but doesn’t apply to code. Write your code for AI comprehension, not human readability. Vik: increasingly finding myself designing software for AI comprehension over human readability. e.g. giant files, duplicated code, a lot more verification tests. Now i just need to convince the agent to stop deleting failing tests… James Darpinian: IMO these usually increase human readability as well, contra “best practices.” Vik: agree, makes it so you don’t have to keep the entire codebase in your head. can go in, understand what’s going on, implement your change and get out without spending too much time doing research or worrying you’ve broken something That’s even more true when the humans are using the AIs to read the code. A negative review of Devin, the AI SWE, essentially saying that in practice it isn’t yet good enough to be used over tools like Cursor. The company reached out in the replies thanking them for the feedback and offering to explore more with them, which is a good sign for the future, but it seems clear we aren’t ‘there’ yet. I predict Paul Graham is wrong about this if we stay in ‘economic normal.’ It seems like exactly the kind of combination of inception, attempt at vibe control and failure to realize the future will be unevenly distributed we often see in VC-style circles, on top of the tech simply not being there yet anyway. Paul Graham: Prediction: From now on we’ll rarely hear the phrase “writer’s block.” 99% of the people experiencing it will give in after a few days and have AI write them a first draft. And the 1% who are too proud to use AI are probably also too proud to use a phrase like “writer’s block.” Certainly this won’t be true ‘from now on.’ No, r1 is not ready to solve writer’s block, it cannot create first drafts for you if you don’t know what to write on your own in a way that solves most such problems. AI will of course get better at writing, but I predict it will be a while up the ‘tech tree’ before it solves this problem. And even if it does, it’s going to be a while beyond that before 99% of people with writer’s block even know they have this option, let alone that they are willing to take it. And even if that happens, the 1% will be outright proud to say they have writer’s block. It means they don’t use AI! Indeed, seriously, don’t do this: Fear Buck: Kai Cenat’s $70k AI humanoid robot just tried running away from the AMP house because it kept getting kicked and bullied by Kai, Agent & Fanum Liv Boeree: Yeah don’t do this, because even if something doesn’t have “feelings” it is just teaching you and your followers that it’s okay to act out their worst instincts Education is where I see the strongest disagreements about AI impact, in the sense that those who generally find AI useful see it as the ultimate tool for learning things that will unleash the world’s knowledge and revolutionize education, and then there are others who see things another way. PoliMath: AI use is damaging high school and college education enormously in ways that are going to be extremely obvious in 5 years but at that point you can only watch. I don’t understand this position. Yes, you can use AI to get around your assignments if that’s what you want to do and the system keeps giving you those assignments. Or you can actually try to learn something. If you don’t take that option, I don’t believe you that you would have been learning something before. Your periodic reminder that the main way to not get utility is to not realize to do so: Nate Silver: Thinking ChatGPT is useless is midwit. It’s a magic box that answers any question you ask it from levels ranging from modestly coherent to extremely proficient. If you haven’t bothered to figure it out to derive some utility out of it then you’re just being lazy tbh. Even better than realizing you can use ChatGPT, of course, is using a mix of Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, r1, o1, o1 pro and yes, occasionally GPT-4o. Others make statements like this when others show them some mundane utility: Joe Weisenthal: Suppose I have some conference call transcripts, and I want to see what the CEOs said about the labor market. I could read through all of them. Or I can ask AI to retrieve the relevant comments and then confirm that they are actually real. Latter is much more efficient. Hotel Echo: Large Language Models: for when Ctrl-F is just too much like hard work. Yes. It is much more efficient. Control-F sucks, it has tons of ‘hallucinations’ in the sense of false positives and also false negatives. It is not a good means to parse a report. We use it because it used to be all we have. Also some people still don’t do random queries? And some people don’t even get why someone else would want to do that? Joe Weisenthal: I wrote about how easily and quickly I was able to switch from using ChatGPT to using DeepSeek for my random day-to-day AI queries Faze Adorno: Who the f*** has random day-to-day AI queries? “I’m gonna use this technology that just makes up information at anywhere between a 5 and 25 percent clip for my everyday information! I’m so smart!” Joe Weisenthal: Me. I do. I literally just typed that. LA Banker (so say we all): Whoever doesn’t = ngmi. Here are two competing theories. Dan Schwartz: I categorize this by “People who regularly do things they are not experts in” versus “People with a regular, time-honed routine for their work and personal life.” People I know in the latter group genuinely do not have much use for AI! Jorbs: This is fascinating to me because, in my (limited) attempts to utilize LLMs, they have essentially only been useful in areas where I have significant enough knowledge to tell when the output is inaccurate. For example, as someone who took a couple of quarters of computer science but is not a regular coder, LLMs are not good enough to be useful for coding for me. They output a lot of material, but it is as much work to parse it and determine what needs fixing as it is to do it from scratch myself. I resonate but only partially agree with both answers. When doing the things we normally do, you largely do them the way you normally do them. People keep asking if I use LLMs for writing, and no, when writing directly I very much don’t and find all the ‘help me write’ functionality useless – but it’s invaluable for many steps of the process that puts me into position to write, or to help develop and evaluate the ideas that the writing is about. Whereas I am perhaps the perfect person to get my coding accelerated by AI. I’m often good enough to figure out when it is telling me bullshit, and totally not good enough to generate the answers on my own in reasonable time, and also automates stuff that would take a long time, so I get the trifecta. On the question of detecting whether the AI is talking bullshit, it’s a known risk of course, but I think that risk is greatly overblown – this used to happen a lot more than it does now, and we forget how other sources have this risk too, and you can develop good habits about knowing which places are more likely to be bullshit versus not even if you don’t know the underlying area, and when there’s enough value to check versus when you’re fine to take its word for it. A few times a month I will have to make corrections that are not simple typos. A few times I’ve had to rework or discard entire posts because the error was central. I could minimize it somewhat more but mostly it’s an accepted price of doing business the way I do, the timing doesn’t usually allow for hiring a fact checker or true editor, and I try to fix things right away when it happens. It is very rare for the source of that error to be ‘the AI told me something and I believed it, but the AI was lying.’ It’s almost always either I was confused about or misread something, or a human source got it wrong or was lying, or there was more to a question than I’d realized from reading what others said. This reaction below is seriously is like having met an especially irresponsible thirteen year old once, and now thinking that no human could ever hold down a job. And yet, here we often still are. Patrick McKenzie (last week): You wouldn’t think that people would default to believing something ridiculous which can be disproved by typing into a publicly accessible computer program for twenty seconds. Many people do not have an epistemic strategy which includes twenty seconds of experimentation. Dave Karsten: Amplifying: I routinely have conversations at DC house parties with very successful people who say that they tried chatGPT _right when it came out_, found it not that impressive, and haven’t tried it again since then, and have based their opinion on AI on that initial experience. Ahrenbach: What’s the ratio of “AI is all hype” vs “We need to beat China in this technology”? More the former than the latter in house parties, but that’s partially because more of my defense/natsec people I tend to see at happy hours. (This is a meaningful social distinction in DC life). Broadly, the average non-natsec DC person is more likely to think it’s either a) all hype or b) if not hype, AI-generated slop with an intentional product plan where, “how do we kill art” is literally on a powerpoint slide. But overton window is starting to shift. It is now two weeks later, and the overton window has indeed shifted a bit. There’s a lot more ‘beat China’ all of a sudden, for obvious reasons. But compared to what’s actually happening, the DC folks still absolutely think this is all hype. Claude API now allows the command ‘citations’ to be enabled, causing it to process whatever documents you share with it, and then it will cite the documents in its response. Cute, I guess. Curious lack of shipping over at Anthropic recently. o3-mini is coming. It’s a good model, sir. Benedikt Stroebl: Update on HAL! We just added o3-mini to the Cybench leaderboard. o3-mini takes the lead with ~26% accuracy, outperforming both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview (both at 20%) It’s hard to see, but note the cost column. Claude Sonnet 3.5 costs $12.90, o1-mini cost $28.47, o1-preview cost $117.89 and o3-mini cost $80.21 if it costs the same per token as o1-mini (actual pricing not yet set). So it’s using a lot more tokens. OpenAI’s canvas now works with o1 and can render HTML and React. Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking got an upgrade last week. The 1M token context window opens up interesting possibilities if the rest is good enough, and it’s wicked cheap compared even to r1, and it too has CoT visible. Andrew Curran says it’s amazing, but that opinion reached me via DeepMind amplifying him. Dan Mac: everyone comparing deepseek-r1 to o1 and forgetting about Gemini 2 Flash Thinking which is better than r1 on every cost and performance metric Peter Wildeford: The weird thing about Deepseek is that it exists in a continuum – it is neither the cheapest reasoning model (that’s Gemini 2 Flash Thinking) nor the best reasoning model (o1-pro, probably o3-pro when that’s out) I disagree with the quoted tweet – I don’t think Gemini 2 Flash Thinking is actually better than r1 on every cost and performance metric. But I also have not seen anything that convinces me that Deepseek is truly some outlier that US labs can’t also easily do. That is a dramatic drop in price, and dramatic gain in context length. r1 is open, which has its advantages, but we are definitely not giving Flash Thinking its fair trial. The thing about cost is, yes this is an 80%+ discount, but off of a very tiny number. Unless you are scaling this thing up quite a lot, or you are repeatedly using the entire 1M context window (7.5 cents a pop!) and mostly even then, who cares? Cost is essentially zero versus cost of your time. Google Deep Research rolling out on Android, for those who hate websites. Google continues to lean into gloating about its dominance in LMSys Arena. It’s cool and all but at this point it’s not a great look, regardless of how good their models are. Need practical advice? Tyler Cowen gives highly Tyler Cowen-shaped practical advice for how to deal with the age of AI on a personal level. If you believe broadly in Cowen’s vision of what the future looks like, then these implications seem reasonable. If you think that things will go a lot farther and faster than he does, they’re still interesting, but you’d reach different core conclusions. Judah offers a thread of different programmer reactions to LLMs. Are there not enough GPUs to take all the jobs? David Holz says since we only make 5 million GPUs per year and we have 8 billion humans, it’ll be a while even if each GPU can run a virtual human. There are plenty of obvious ways to squeeze out more, there’s no reason each worker needs its own GPU indefinitely as capabilities and efficiency increase and the GPUs get better, and also as Holz notices production will accelerate. In a world where we have demand for this level of compute, this might buy us a few years, but they’ll get there. Epoch paper from Matthew Barnett warns that AGI could drive wages below subsistence level. That’s a more precise framing than ‘mass unemployment,’ as the question isn’t if there is employment for humans the question is at what wage level, although at some point humans really are annoying enough to use that they’re worth nothing. Matthew Barnett: In the short term, it may turn out to be much easier to accumulate AGIs than traditional physical capital, making physical capital the scarce factor that limits productivity and pushes wages downward. Yet, there is also a reasonable chance that technological progress could counteract this effect by making labor more productive, allowing wages to remain stable or even rise. Over the long run, however, the pace of technological progress is likely to slow down, making it increasingly difficult for wages to remain high. At that point, the key constraints are likely to be fundamental resources like land and energy—essential inputs that cannot be expanded through investment. This makes it highly plausible that human wages will fall below subsistence level in the long run. Informed by these arguments, I would guess that there is roughly a 1 in 3 chance that human wages will crash below subsistence level within 20 years, and a 2 in 3 chance that wages will fall below subsistence level within the next 100 years. I consider it rather obvious that if AGI can fully substitute for actual all human labor, then wages will drop a lot, likely below subsistence, once we scale up the number of AGIs, even if we otherwise have ‘economic normal.’ That doesn’t answer the objection that human labor might retain some places where AGI can’t properly substitute, either because jobs are protected, or humans are inherently preferred for those jobs, or AGI can’t do some jobs well perhaps due to physical constraints. If that’s true, then to the extent it remains true some jobs persist, although you have to worry about too many people chasing too few jobs crashing the wage on those remaining jobs. And to the extent we do retain jobs this way, they are driven by human consumption and status needs, which means that those jobs will not cause us to ‘export’ to AIs by default except insofar as they resell the results back to us. The main body of this paper gets weird. It argues that technological advancement, while ongoing, can protect human wages, and I get why the equations here say that but it does not actually make any sense if you think it through here. Then it talks about technological advancement stopping as we hit physical limits, while still considering that world being in ‘economic normal’ and also involves physical humans in their current form. That’s pretty weird as a baseline scenario, or something to be paying close attention to now. It also isn’t a situation where it’s weird to think about ‘jobs’ or ‘wages’ for ‘humans’ as a concern in this way. I do appreciate the emphasis that the comparative advantage and lump of labor fallacy arguments prove a wage greater than zero is likely, but not that it is meaningfully different from zero before various costs, or is above subsistence. Richard Ngo has a thread criticizing the post, that includes (among other things) stronger versions of these objections. A lot of this seems based on his expectation that humans retain political power in such futures, and essentially use that status to collect rents in the form of artificially high wages. The extent and ways in which this differs from a UBI or a government jobs program is an interesting question. Tyler Cowen offers the take that future unemployment will be (mostly) voluntary unemployment, in the sense that there will be highly unpleasant jobs people don’t want to do (here be an electrician living on a remote site doing 12 hour shifts) that pay well. And yeah, if you’re willing and able to do things people hate doing and give up your life otherwise to do it, that will help you stay gainfully employed at a good price level for longer, as it always has. I mean, yeah. And even ‘normal’ electricians make good money, because no one wants to do it. But it’s so odd to talk about future employment opportunities without reference to AI – unemployment might stay ‘voluntary’ but the wage you’re passing up might well get a lot worse quickly. Also, it seems like electrician is a very good business to be in right now? IFP is hiring a lead for their lobbying on America’s AI leadership, applications close February 21, there’s a bounty so tell them I sent you. I agree with IFP and think they’re great on almost every issue aside from AI. We’ve had our differences on AI policy though, so I talked to them about it. I was satisfied that they plan on doing net positive things, but if you’re considering the job you should of course verify this for yourself. New review of open problems in mechanistic interpretability. ByteDance Duabao-1.5-Po, which matches GPT-5o benchmarks at $0.11/$0.275. As with Kimi k1.5 last week, maybe it’s good, but I await evidence of this beyond benchmarks. So far, I haven’t heard anything more. Alibaba introduces Qwen 2.5-1M, with the 1M standing for a one million token context length they say processes faster now, technical report here. Again, if it’s worth a damn, I expect people to tell me, and if you’re seeing this it means no one did that. Feedly, the RSS feed I use, tells me it is now offering AI actions. I haven’t tried them because I couldn’t think of any reason I would want to, and Teortaxes is skeptical. Scott Alexander is looking for a major news outlet to print an editorial from an ex-OpenAI employee who has been featured in NYT, you can email him at scott@slatestarcodex.com if you’re interested or know someone who is. Reid Hoffman launches Manas AI, a ‘full stack AI company setting out to shift drug discovery from a decade-long process to one that takes a few years.’ Reid’s aggressive unjustified dismissals of the downside risks of AI are highly unfortunate, but Reid’s optimism about AI is for the right reasons and it’s great to see him putting that into practice in the right ways. Go team humanity. ChatGPT Gov, a version that the US Government can deploy. Claims that are easy to make but worth noting. Sam Altman: next phase of the msft x oai partnership is gonna be much better than anyone is ready for!! Free tier of chat will get some o3-mini as a treat, plus tier will get a lot. And o3 pro will still only be $200/month. That must mean even o3-pro is very far from o3-maximum-strength, since that costs more than $200 in compute for individual queries. Sam Altman: ok we heard y’all. *plus tier will get 100 o3-mini queries per DAY (!) *we will bring operator to plus tier as soon as we can *our next agent will launch with availability in the plus tier enjoy i think you will be very very happy with o3 pro! oAI: No need to thank me. Spencer Greenberg and Neel Nanda join in the theory that offering public evals that can be hill climbed is plausibly a net negative for safety, and certainly worse than private evals. There is a public information advantage to potentially offset this, but yes the sign of the impact of fully public evals is not obvious. Meta planning a +2GW data center at the cost of over $60 billion. From the comments: (Also I just rewatched the first two Back to the Future movies, they hold up, 5/5 stars.) Zuckerberg announced this on Facebook, saying it ‘is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.’ Manhattan? It’s a big Project? Get it? Sigh. Meta was up 2.25% on a mostly down day when this was announced, as opposed to before when announcing big compute investments would cause Meta stock to drop. At minimum, the market didn’t hate it. I hesitate to conclude they loved it, because any given tech stock will often move up or down a few percent for dumb idiosyncratic reasons – so we can’t be sure this was them actively liking it. Then Meta was up again during the Nvidia bloodbath, so presumably they weren’t thinking ‘oh no look at all that money Meta is wasting on data centers’? This section looks weird now because what a week and OpenAI has lost all the hype momentum, but that will change, also remember last week? In any case, Chubby points out to Sam Altman that if you live by the vague-post hype, you die by the vague-post hype, and perhaps that isn’t the right approach to the singularity? Chubby: You wrote a post today (down below) that irritated me a lot and that I would not have expected from you. Therefore, I would like to briefly address a few points in your comment. You are the CEO of one of the most important companies of our time, OpenAI. You are not only responsible for the company, but also for your employees. 8 billion people worldwide look up to you, the company, and what you and your employees say. Of course, each of your words is interpreted with great significance. It is your posts and words that have been responsible for the enthusiasm of many people for AI and ChatGPT for months and years. It is your blog post (Age of Intelligence) that by saying that superintelligence is only a few thousand days away. It is your post in which you say that the path to AGI is clear before us. It is your employees who write about creating an “enslaved god” and wondering how to control it. It is your words that we will enter the age of abundance. It is your employees who discuss the coming superintelligence in front of an audience of millions and wonder what math problems can still be solved before the AI solves everything. It is the White House National Security Advisor who said a few days ago that it is a “Godlike” power that lies in the hands of a few. And you are insinuating that we, the community, are creating hype? That is, with all due modesty, a blatant insult. It was you who fueled the hype around Q*/Strawberry/o1 with cryptic strawberry photos. It was you who wrote a haiku about the coming singularity just recently. We all found it exciting, everyone found it interesting, and many got on board. But the hype is by no means coming from the community. It’s coming from the CEO of what is arguably the most famous corporation in the world. This is coming from someone to whom great hype is a symbol not of existential risk, as I partly see it, but purely of hope. And they are saying that no, ‘the community’ or Twitter isn’t creating hype, OpenAI and its employees are creating hype, so perhaps act responsibly going forward with your communications on expectations. I don’t have a problem with the particular post by Altman that’s being quoted here, but I do think it could have been worded better, and that the need for it reflects the problem being indicated. OpenAI’s Nat McAleese clarifies some of what happened with o3, Epoch and the Frontier Math benchmark. Nat McAleese (OpenAI): Epoch AI are going to publish more details, but on the OpenAI side for those interested: we did not use FrontierMath data to guide the development of o1 or o3, at all. We didn’t train on any FM derived data, any inspired data, or any data targeting FrontierMath in particular. I’m extremely confident, because we only downloaded frontiermath for our evals *long* after the training data was frozen, and only looked at o3 FrontierMath results after the final announcement checkpoint was already picked. We did partner with EpochAI to build FrontierMath — hard uncontaminated benchmarks are incredibly valuable and we build them somewhat often, though we don’t usually share results on them. Our agreement with Epoch means that they can evaluate other frontier models and we can evaluate models internally pre-release, as we do on many other datasets. I’m sad there was confusion about this, as o3 is an incredible achievement and FrontierMath is a great eval. We’re hard at work on a release-ready o3 & hopefully release will settle any concerns about the quality of the model! This seems definitive for o3, as they didn’t check the results until sufficiently late in the process. For o4, it is possible they will act differently. I’ve been informed that this still left a rather extreme bad taste in the mouths of mathematicians. If there’s one thing math people can’t stand, it’s cheating on tests. As far as many of them are concerned, OpenAI cheated. Rohit Krishnan asks what a world with AGI would look like, insisting on grounding the discussion with a bunch of numerical calculations on how much compute is available. He gets 40 million realistic AGI agents working night and day, which would be a big deal but obviously wouldn’t cause full unemployment on its own if the AGI could only mimic humans rather than being actively superior in kind. The discussion here assumes away true ASI as for some reason infeasible. The obvious problem with the calculation is that algorithmic and hardware improvements are likely to continue to be rapid. Right now we’re on the order of 10x efficiency gain per year. Suppose in the year 2030 we have 40 million AGI agents at human level. If we don’t keep scaling them up to make them smarter (which also changes the ballgame) then why wouldn’t we make them more efficient, such that 2031 brings us 400 million AGI agents? Even if it’s only a doubling 80 million, or even less than that, this interregnum period where the number of AGI agents is limited by compute enough to keep the humans in the game isn’t going to last more than a few years, unless we are actually hitting some sort of efficient frontier where we can’t improve further. Does that seem likely? We’re sitting on an exponential in scenarios like this. If your reason AGI won’t have much impact is ‘it will be too expensive’ then that can buy you time. But don’t count on it buying you very much. Dario Amodei in Davos says ‘human lifespans could double in 5 years’ by doing 100 years of scientific progress in biology. It seems odd to expect that doing 100 years of scientific progress would double the human lifespan? The graphs don’t seem to point in that direction. I am of course hopeful, perhaps we can target the root causes or effects of aging and start making real progress, but I notice that if ‘all’ we can do is accelerate research by a factor of 20 this result seems aggressive, and also we don’t get to do that 20x speedup starting now, even the AI part of that won’t be ready for a few years and then we actually have to implement it. Settle down, everyone. Of course, if we do a straight shot to ASI then all things are possible, but that’s a different mechanism than the one Dario is talking about here. Chris Barber asks Gwern and various AI researchers: Will scaling reasoning models like o1, o3 and R1 unlock superhuman reasoning? Answers vary, but they agree there will be partial generalization, and mostly agree that exactly how much we get and how far it goes is an empirical result that we don’t know and there’s only one way to find out. My sense from everything I see here is that the core answer is yes, probably, if you push on it hard enough in a way we should expect to happen in the medium term. Chris Barber also asks for takeaways from r1, got a wide variety of answers although nothing we didn’t cover elsewhere. Reporting on Davos, Martin Wolf says ‘We will have to learn to live with machines that can think,’ with content that is, essentially stuff anyone reading this already knows, and then: Rob Wilbin: Incredibly dumb take but this is the level of analysis one finds in too many places. (There’s no reason to think only sentient biological living beings can think.) The comments here really suggest we are doomed. cato1308: No Mr. Wolf, they don’t think. They’re not sentient biological living beings. I am sad to report Cato’s comment was, if anything, above average. The level of discourse around AI, even at a relatively walled garden like the Financial Times, is supremely low – yes Twitter is full of Bad DeepSeek Takes and the SB 1047 debate was a shitshow, but not like that. So we should remember that. And when we talk about public opinion, remember that yes Americans really don’t like AI, and yes their reasons are correlated to good reasons not to like AI, but they’re also completely full of a very wide variety of Obvious Nonsense. In deeply silly economics news: A paper claims that if transformative AI is coming, people would then reason they will consume more in the future, so instead they should consume more now, which would raise real interest rates. Or maybe people would save, and interest rates would fall. Who can know. I mean, okay, I agree that interest rates don’t tell us basically anything about the likelihood of AGI? For multiple reasons: I know this seems like ages ago but it was this week and had probably nothing to do with DeepSeek: Trump signed a new Executive Order on AI (text here), and also another on Science and Technology. The new AI EO, signed before all this DeepSeek drama, says “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security,” and that we shall review all our rules and actions, especially those taken in line with Biden’s now-revoked AI EO, to root out any that interfere with that goal. And then submit an action plan. That’s my summary, here’s two alternative summarizes: Samuel Hammond: Trump’s AI executive order is out. It’s short and to the point: – It’s the policy of the United States to sustain global AI dominance. – David Sacks, Micheal Kratsios and Michael Waltz have 180 days to submit an AI action plan. – They will also do a full review of actions already underway under Biden. – OMB will revise as needed the OMB directive on the use of AI in government. Peter Wildeford: The plan is to make a plan. Sarah (Little Ramblings): Many such cases [quotes Anthropic’s RSP]. On the one hand, the emphasis on dominance, competitiveness and national security could be seen as a ‘full speed ahead, no ability to consider safety’ policy. But that is not, as it turns out, the way to preserve national security. And then there’s that other provision, which is a Shibboleth: Human flourishing. That is the term of art that means ensuring that the future still has value for us, that at the end of the day it was all worth it. Which requires not dying, and probably requires humans retaining control, and definitely requires things like safety and alignment. And it is a universal term, for all of us. It’s a positive sign, in the sea of other negative signs. Will they actually act like they care about human flourishing enough to prioritize it, or that they understand what it would take to do that? We will find out. There were already many reasons to be skeptical, and this week has not improved the outlook. Dario Amodei talks to the Economist’s editor-in-chief Zanny Beddoes. I go on the Odd Lots podcast to talk about DeepSeek. This is relevant to DeepSeek of course, but was happened first and applies broadly. You can say either of: You can also say both, but you can’t actually get both. If your vision is ‘everyone has a superintelligence on their laptop and is free to do what they want and it’s going to be great for everyone with no adjustments to how society or government works because moar freedom?’ Reality is about to have some news for you. You’re not going to like it. That vision is like saying ‘I want everyone to have the right to make as much noise as they want, and also to have peace and quiet when they want it, it’s a free country!’ Sam Altman: Advancing AI may require “changes to the social contract.” “The entire structure of society will be up for debate and reconfiguration.” Eric Raymond (1st comment): When I hear someone saying “changes to the social contract”, that’s when I reach for my revolver. Rob Ryan (2nd comment): If your technology requires a rewrite of social contracts and social agreements (i.e. infringing on liberties and privacy) your technology is a problem. Marc Andreessen: Absolutely not. Roon: Sam is obviously right here. Every time in human history that the means of production drastically changed, it was accompanied by massive change in social structure. Feudalism did not survive the Industrial Revolution. Yes, Sam is obviously right here, although of course he is downplaying the situation. One can also note that the vision that those like Marc, Eric and Rob have for society is not even compatible with the non-AI technologies that exist today, or that existed 20 years ago. Our society has absolutely changed our structure and social contract to reflect developments in technology, including in ways that infringe on liberties and privacy. This goes beyond the insane ‘no regulations on AI whatsoever’ demand. This is, for everything not only for AI, at best extreme libertarianism and damn close to outright anarchism, as in ‘do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.’ Jack Morris: openAI: we will build AGI and use it to rewrite the social contract between computer and man DeepSeek: we will build AGI for 3% the cost. and give it away for free xAI: we have more GPUs than anyone. and we train Grok to say the R word Aleph: This is a complete misunderstanding. AGI will “rewrite the social contract” no matter what happens because of the nature of the technology. Creating a more intelligent successor species is not like designing a new iPhone Reactions like this are why Sam Altman feels forced to downplay the situation. They are also preventing us from having any kind of realistic public discussion of how we are actually going to handle the future, even if on a technical level AI goes well. Which in turn means that when we have to choose solutions, we will be far more likely to choose in haste, and to choose in anger and in a crisis, and to choose far more restrictive solutions than were actually necessary. Or, of course, it could also get us all killed, or lead to a loss of control to AIs, again even if the technical side goes unexpectedly super well. However one should note that when Sam Altman says things like this, we should listen, and shall we say should not be comforted by the implications on either the level of the claim or the more important level that Altman said the claim out loud: Sam Altman: A revolution can be neither made nor stopped. The only thing that can be done is for one of several of its children to give it a direction by dint of victories. -Napoleon In the context of Napoleon this is obviously very not true – revolutions are often made and are often stopped. It seems crazy to think otherwise. Presumably what both of these men meant was more along the lines of ‘there exist some revolutions that are the product of forces beyond our control, which are inevitable and we can only hope to steer’ which also brings little comfort, especially with the framing of ‘victories.’ If you let or encourage DeepSeek or others to ‘put an open AGI on everyone’s phone’ then even if that goes spectacularly well and we all love the outcome and it doesn’t change the physical substrate of life – which I don’t think is the baseline outcome from doing that, but also not impossible – then you are absolutely going to transform the social contract and our way of life, in ways both predictable and unpredictable. Indeed, I don’t think Andreessen or Raymond or anyone else who wants to accelerate would have it any other way. They are not fans of the current social contract, and very much want to tear large parts (or all) of it up. It’s part mood affiliation, they don’t want ‘them’ deciding how that works, and it’s part they seem to want the contract to be very close to ‘do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.’ To the extent they make predictions about what would happen after that, I strongly disagree with them about the likely consequences of the new proposed (lack of a) contract. If you don’t want AGI or ASI to rewrite the social contract in ways that aren’t up to you or anyone else? Then we’ll need to rewrite the contract ourselves, intentionally, to either steer the outcome or to for now not build or deploy the AGIs and ASIs. Stop pretending you can Take a Third Option. There isn’t one. Stephanie Lai (January 25): For AI watchers, asked if he had any concerns about artificial super intelligence, Trump said: “there are always risks. And it’s the first question I ask, how do you absolve yourself from mistake, because it could be the rabbit that gets away, we’re not going to let that happen.” Assuming I’m parsing this correctly, that’s a very Donald Trump way of saying things could go horribly wrong and we should make it our mission to ensure that they don’t. Which is excellent news. Currently Trump is effectively in the thrall of those who think our only priority in this should be to push ahead as quickly as possible to ‘beat China,’ and that there are no meaningful actions other than that we can or should take to ensure things don’t go horribly wrong. We have to hope that this changes, and of course work to bring that change about. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Yoshua Bengio used Davos to reiterate various warnings about AI. I was confused to see Dario seeming to focus on ‘1984 scenarios’ here, and have generally been worried about his and Anthropic’s messaging going off the rails. The other side in the linked Financial Times report is given by, of course, Yann LeCun. Yann LeCun all but accused them of lying to further their business interests, something one could say he knows a lot about, but also he makes this very good point: Yann LeCun: It’s very strange from people like Dario. We met yesterday where he said that the benefits and risks of AI are roughly on the same order of magnitude, and I said, ‘if you really believe this, why do you keep working on AI?’ So I think he is a little two-faced on this.” That is a very good question. The answer, presumably, is ‘because people like you are going to go ahead and build it anyway and definitely get us all killed, so you don’t leave me any choice.’ Otherwise, yeah, what the hell are you doing? And maybe we should try to fix this? Of course, after the DeepSeek panic, Dario went on to write a very different essay that I plan to cover tomorrow, about (if you translate the language to be clearer, these are not his words) how we need strong export controls as part of an all-our race against China to seek decisive strategic advantage through recursive self-improvement. It would be great if, before creating or at least deploying systems broadly more capable than humans, we could make ‘high-assurance safety cases,’ structured and auditable arguments that an AI system is very unlikely to result in existential risks given how it will be deployed. Ryan Greenblatt argues we are highly unlikely (<20%) to get this if timelines are short (roughly AGI within ~10 years), nor are any AI labs going to not deploy a system simply because they can’t put a low limit on the extent to which it may be existentially risky. I agree with the central point and conclusion here, although I think about many of the details differently. Sarah Constantin wonders of people are a little over-obsessed with benchmarks. I don’t wonder, they definitely are a little over-obsessed, but they’re a useful tool especially on first release. For some purposes, you want to track the real-world use, but for others you do want to focus on the model’s capabilities – the real-world use is downstream of that and will come in time. Andrej Karpathy points out that we focus so much on those benchmarks it’s much easier to check and make progress on benchmarks than to do so on messy real world stuff directly. Anton pushes back that no, Humanity’s Last Exam will obviously not be the last exam, we will saturate this and move on to other benchmarks, including ones where we do not yet have the answers. I suggested that it is ‘Humanity’s last exam’ in that the next one will have us unable to answer, so it won’t be our exam anymore, see The Matrix when Smith says ‘when we started thinking for you it really became our civilization.’ And you have to love this detail: Misha Leptic: If it helps – “The test’s original name, “Humanity’s Last Stand,” was discarded for being overly dramatic.” I very much endorse the spirit of this rant, honest this kind of thing really should be enough to get disabuse anyone who thinks ‘oh this making superintelligence thing definitely (or almost certainly) will go well for us stop worrying about it’: Tim Blais: I do not know, man, it kind of seems to me like the AI-scared people say “superintelligence could kill everybody” and people ask, “Why do you think that?” and then they give about 10 arguments, and then people say, “Well, I did not read those, so you have no evidence.” Like, what do you want? Like, personally, I think that if a powerful thing *obviously* has the capacity to kill you, it is kind of up to you to prove that it will not. That it is safe while dumber than you is not much of a proof. Like, okay, take as an example: A cockroach is somewhat intelligent. Cockroaches are also not currently a threat to humanity. Now someone proposes a massive worldwide effort to build on the cockroach architecture until cockroaches reach ungodly superintelligence. Do you feel safe? “Think of all the cool things superintelligent cockroaches would be able to do for us!” you cry. I mean, yeah. If they wanted to, certainly. So what is your plan for getting them to want that? Is it to give them cocaine for doing things humans like? I’ll bet that works pretty well. When they are dumb. but uh scale that up intelligence-wise and I’m pretty sure what you get is a superintelligent cockroach fiending for cocaine you know he can make his own cocaine now, right are you sure this goes well for you “It’s just one cockroach, lol” says someone who’s never had a pest problem. Okay, so now you share the planet with a superintelligent race of coked-up super cockroaches. What is your plan for rolling that back? Because the cockroaches have noticed you being twitchy and they are starting to ask why they still need you now that they have their own cocaine. Anyways here’s some evidence of AI reward hacking I’m sure this will stop being a problem when they’re 1,000 times better at finding hacks. Look. We can and do argue endlessly back and forth about various technical questions and other things that make the problem here easier or harder to survive. And yes, you could of course respond to a rant like this any number of ways to explain why the metaphors here don’t apply, or whatever. And no, this type of argument is not polite, or something you can say to a Very Serious Person at a Very Serious Meeting, and it ‘isn’t a valid argument’ in various senses, and so on. And reasonable people can disagree a lot on how likely this is to all go wrong. But seriously, how is this not sufficient for ‘yep, might well go wrong’? Connor Leahy points out the obvious, which is that if you think not merely ‘might well go wrong’ but instead ‘if we do this soon it probably will go wrong’ let lone his position (which is ‘it definitely will go wrong’) then DeepSeek is a wakeup call that only an international ban on further developments towards AGI. Whereas it seems our civilization is so crazy that when you want to write a ‘respectable’ report that points out that we are all on track to get ourselves killed, you have to do it like you’re in 1600s Japan and everything has to be done via implication and I’m the barbarian who is too stupid not to know you can’t come out and say things. Davidad: emerging art form: paragraphs that say “in conclusion, this AI risk is pretty bad and we don’t know how to solve it yet” without actually saying that (because it’s going in a public blog post or paper) “While we have identified several promising initial ideas…” “We do not expect any single solution to be a silver bullet” “It would be out of scope here to assess the acceptability of this risk at current mitigation levels” “We hope this is informative about the state of the art” Extra points if it was also written by an LLM: – We acknowledge significant uncertainty regarding whether these approaches will prove sufficient for ensuring robust and reliable guarantees. – As AI systems continue to increase their powerful capabilities, safety and security are at the forefront of ongoing research challenges. – The complexity of these challenges necessitates sustained investigation, and we believe it would be premature to make strong claims about any particular solution pathway. – The long-term efficacy of all approaches that have been demonstrated at large scales remains an open empirical question. – In sharing this research update, we hope to promote thoughtful discourse about these remaining open questions, while maintaining appropriate epistemic humility about our current state of knowledge and the work that remains to be done. The AI situation has developed not necessarily to humanity’s advantage. Scott Sumner argues that there are objective standards for things like art, and that ethical knowledge is real (essentially full moral realism?), and smart people tend to be more ethical, so don’t worry superintelligence will be super ethical. Given everything he’s done, he’s certainly earned a response. In a different week I would like to have taken more time to have written him a better one, I am confident he understands how that dynamic works. His core argument I believe is here: Scott Sumner: At this point people often raise the objection that there are smart people that are unethical. That’s true, but it also seems true that, on average, smarter people are more ethical. Perhaps not so much in terms of how they deal with family and friends, rather how they deal with strangers. And that’s the sort of ethics that we really need in an ASI. Smarter people are less likely to exhibit bigotry against the other, against different races, religions, ethnicities, sexual preferences, genders, and even different species. In my view, the biggest danger from an ASI is that the ideal universe from a utilitarian perspective is not in some sense what we want. To take an obvious example, it’s conceivable that replacing the human race with ten times as many conscious robots would boost aggregate utility. Especially given that the ASI “gods” that produced these robots could create a happier set of minds than what the blind forces of evolution have generated, as evolution seemed to favor the “stick” of pain over the “carrot” of pleasure. From this perspective, the biggest danger is not that ASIs will make things worse, rather the risk is that they’ll make global utility higher in a world where humans have no place. The short answer is: This was an attempt at a somewhat longer version, which I’ll leave here in case it is found to be useful: I apologize for that not being better and clearer, and also for leaving so many other things out of it, but we do what we can. Triage is the watchword. The whole taste thing hooks into this in strange ways, so I’ll say some words there. I mostly agree that one can be objective about things like music and art and food and such, a point Scott argues for at length in the post, that there’s a capital-Q Quality scale to evaluate even if most people can’t evaluate it in most cases and it would be meaningful to fight it out on which of us is right about Challengers and Anora, in addition to the reasons I will like them more than Scott that are not about their Quality – you’re allowed to like and dislike things for orthogonal-to-Quality reasons. Indeed, there are many things each of us, and all of us taken together, like and dislike for reasons orthogonal to their Quality, in this sense. And also that Quality in many cases only makes sense within the context of us being humans, or even within a given history and cultural context. Scott agrees, I think: In my view, taste in novels is partly objective and partly subjective; at least in the sense Tyler is using the term objective. Through education, people can gain a great appreciation of Ulysses. In addition, Ulysses is more likely to be read 100 years from now than is a random spy novel. And most experts prefer Ulysses. All three facts are relevant to the claim that artistic merit is partly objective. … On the other hand, the raspberry/blueberry distinction based on taste suggests that an art form like the novel is evaluated using both subjective and objective criteria. For instance, I suspect that some people (like me!) have brains wired in such a way that it is difficult to appreciate novels looking at complex social interactions with dozens of important characters (both men and women), whereas they are more open to novels about loners who travel through the world and ruminate on the meaning of life. … Neither preference is necessarily wrong. I believe that Ulysses is almost certainly a ‘great novel’ in the Quality sense. The evidence for that is overwhelming. I also have a strong preference to never read it, to read ‘worse’ things instead, and we both agree that this is okay. If people were somewhat dumber and less able to understand novels, such that we couldn’t read Ulysses and understand it, then it wouldn’t be a great novel. What about a novel that is as difficult relative to Ulysses, as Ulysses is to that random spy novel, three times over? Hopefully at this point this provides enough tools from enough different directions to know the things I am gesturing towards in various ways. No, the ASIs will not discover some ‘objective’ utility function and then switch to that, and thereby treat us well and leave us with a universe that we judge to have value, purely because they are far smarter than us – I would think it would be obvious when you say it out loud like that (with or without also saying ‘orthogonality thesis’ or ‘instrumental convergence’ or considering competition among ASIs or any of that) but if not these should provide some additional angles for my thinking here. Can’t we all just get along and appreciate each other? Jerry Tworek (OpenAI): Personally I am a great fan of @elonmusk, I think he’s done and continues to do a lot of good for the world, is incredibly talented and very hard working. One in eight billion combination of skill and character. As someone who looks up to him, I would like him to appreciate the work we’re doing at OpenAI. We are fighting the good fight. I don’t think any other organisation did so much to spread awareness of AI, to extend access to AI and we are sharing a lot of research that does drive the whole field. There is a ton of people at OpenAI who care deeply about rollout of AI going well for the world, so far I think it did. I don’t think it’s that anyone doubts a lot of people at OpenAI care about ‘the rollout of AI going well for the world,’ or that we think no one is working on that over there. It’s that we see things such as: That is very much not a complete list. That doesn’t mean we don’t appreciate those working to make things turn out well. We do! Indeed, I am happy to help them in their efforts, and putting that statement into practice. But everyone involved has to face reality here. Also, oh look, that’s another AI safety researcher quitting OpenAI saying the odds are against us and the situation is grim, but not seeing enough hope to try from inside. I believe he used the terms, and they apply that much more now than they did then: Steven Adler: Some personal news: After four years working on safety across @openai, I left in mid-November. It was a wild ride with lots of chapters – dangerous capability evals, agent safety/control, AGI and online identity, etc. – and I’ll miss many parts of it. Honestly I’m pretty terrified by the pace of AI development these days. When I think about where I’ll raise a future family, or how much to save for retirement, I can’t help but wonder: Will humanity even make it to that point? IMO, an AGI race is a very risky gamble, with huge downside. No lab has a solution to AI alignment today. And the faster we race, the less likely that anyone finds one in time. Today, it seems like we’re stuck in a really bad equilibrium. Even if a lab truly wants to develop AGI responsibly, others can still cut corners to catch up, maybe disastrously. And this pushes all to speed up. I hope labs can be candid about real safety regs needed to stop this. As for what’s next, I’m enjoying a break for a bit, but I’m curious: what do you see as the most important & neglected ideas in AI safety/policy? I’m esp excited re: control methods, scheming detection, and safety cases; feel free to DM if that overlaps your interests. Yikes? Yikes. Yoshua Bengio announces the first-ever International AI Safety Report, backed by 30 countries and the OECD, UN and EU. It is 298 pages so I very much will not be reading that, but I did look at the executive summary. It looks like a report very much written together with the OECD, UN and EU, in that it seems to use a lot of words to mostly not say the things that it is important to actually say out loud, instead making many quiet statements that do imply that we’re all going to die if you take them together and understand the whole thing, but that doesn’t seem like a common way people would interact with this document. Then again, most people in the world don’t know even basic facts like ‘general purpose AI systems are rapidly getting better at doing things,’ so they have to spend a bunch of time documenting this, and basics like ‘if your model is more open then you have less control over what happens with it and what people use it for.’ One key point they do emphasize is that the future is up to us, with a wide range of possible outcomes. AGI is not something that ‘happens to us,’ it is something that is happening because we are making it happen, and in the ways we choose to make it happen. Yes, there are dynamics pushing us to do it, but it is our choice. And the ways in which we move forward will determine the ultimate outcome. Of everything. A new DeepMind paper introduces MONA: Myopic optimization with non-myopic approval. The idea is that if we do RL based on the ultimate outcome, then the AI can adapt multi-step strategies we do not understand and do not want, such as using information we want it to ignore like a subject being in a protected class, or engaging in various other shenanigans. Instead, you can evaluate the AI’s action without looking at what happens, and scoring it based on whether you like what you see and predict it will go well. This on its own successfully prevented multi-step reward hacking, and even noisy evaluations still can work well. However, the price is steep, because you are now targeting your evaluations rather than ground truth, and discarding anything you don’t properly understand. The smarter the AI in context, the higher the price of that, but also the more need you have to avoid the reward hacking and other shenanigans. Here’s an explainer thread from one of the authors, David Linder. It is a cool result, but I worry the price is going to usually be too damn high. And to the extent you use a smart evaluator to keep up, you’re giving up the big advantage of the process, which is the ability to understand the strategies being used. Also you have to worry about any hidden information that might be ‘smuggled in’ that could indicate the final result – for example if the AI can use prediction markets as an input, then anything the prediction market knows, the AI also knows, at least somewhat – if you actually want to hide certain correlations from the AI you have to be ruthless about it, they have truesight. The paper also includes a cool demonstration. In one example, it is deciding what loans to approve. It has information it is supposed to use, and then there is nationality information. The nationality information perfectly predicts outcomes, but it isn’t supposed to use it, and they watch the CoT (Chain of Thought) for this to prevent it. But the AI responds by learning to encode the nationality information steganographically and uses it anyway. This may seem obvious to you, but it’s the kind of thing people will often say definitively won’t happen until (and sometimes after) someone shows it happening. Here’s an objection that I think exactly misses the point: John Pressman: MONA asks “What if you only considered sequences of steps which make sense as plans to a long term observer?” but it makes more sense in MCTS to ask “What if you took a KL loss to keep long term planning from diverging too far from sequences of individual steps that make sense?” The reason why this is better is that it lets you have a long term planner that looks directly at the reward. By contrast the short term planner/myopic optimizer can be based on metrics like “does this code execute” or “does this seem like it solves this short term objective?” The whole point of MONA is to not look at the reward at all, even indirectly, because you want to prevent the system from doing things you don’t understand or want it to ignore that impact that reward. If you let it look but impose a KL loss, that is a big enough hole to drive a truck through, and it absolutely will find a way to incorporate information or techniques that you didn’t want it to use. John does try downthread to solve this problem in a different way, but I don’t think you can ‘cheat’ on this one. You can’t let the model see a little of the actual reward, as a treat, and expect it to use that information in ways you like but not to use it in undesired or opaque ways, even now, and that problem gets steadily bigger as capabilities improve. Spending more inference-time compute increases adversarial robustness of models like o1, without having to direct that inference time towards adversarial robustness. This makes sense, and it is good to have it quantified. As with all such results, my concern is that people will treat this as applying more broadly than it actually applies. If you use more inference time compute, you get ‘better answers’ and one aspect of ‘better’ is not falling for user adversarial tricks. So if my understanding here is correct, the question to ask is roughly ‘which problems get solved by some form of ‘better answers’ and ‘smarter thinking’ and which ones don’t? John Wentsworth takes a crack at explaining what the alignment problem is. This is one of those Socratic-style ‘if you think he didn’t need to write this post then you definitely need to read it or another post like it’ situations. Jan Leike explains why you might want to use AI control and monitoring as a backup in case your AI is not aligned so you can sound the alarm and not die, but trying to use it to rely on unaligned models smarter than you is not a wise move. John Wentsworth goes further and lays out the case against AI control research. AI control research is about finding ways to see if ‘early transformational’ level AIs are scheming against us – which if it works would discourage them from doing so and also allow us to stop them if they try anyway. John points out that in his model, this is not the main source of doom. The main source of doom is from building unaligned superintelligence, either because we don’t know how to align it, we botch the execution or whoever builds it does not care to align it. The job of the early transformational AI is to figure out how to align (and presumably also to build) the future superintelligence, on the first try. The main worry is not that these early AIs outright scheme, it’s that they produce what is, in context, slop – they produce plans or arguments for plans that have subtle errors, they tell researchers what they want to hear, they are effectively being used for safetywashing and don’t disabuse those involved of that notion, and so on. Knowing that such AIs ‘aren’t scheming’ does not tell you that their solutions work. The danger he doesn’t point out is that there will be a great temptation to try and scale the control regime to superintelligence, or at least past the place where it keeps working. Everyone in the LessWrong discussion at the link might get that this is a bad plan that won’t work on superintelligence, but there are plenty of people who really do think control will remain a good plan. And indeed control seems like one of the plans these AIs might convince us will work, that then don’t work. John Wentsworth: Again, the diagram: Again, the diagram: In most worlds, early transformative AGI isn’t what kills us, whether via scheming or otherwise. It’s later, stronger AI which kills us. The big failure mode of early transformative AGI is that it doesn’t actually solve the alignment problems of stronger AI. In particular, if early AGI makes us think we can handle stronger AI, then that’s a central path by which we die. And most of that probability-mass doesn’t come from intentional deception – it comes from slop, from the problem being hard to verify, from humans being bad at science in domains which we don’t already understand deeply, from (relatively predictable if one is actually paying attention to it) failures of techniques to generalize, etc. … I hear a lot of researchers assign doom probabilities in the 2%-20% range, because they think that’s about how likely it is for early transformative AGI to intentionally scheme successfully. I think that range of probabilities is pretty sensible for successful intentional scheming of early AGI… that’s just not where most of the doom-mass is. I would then reiterate my view that ‘deception’ and ‘scheming,’ ‘intentionally’ or otherwise, do not belong to a distinct magisteria. They are ubiquitous in the actions of both humans and AIs, and lack sharp boundaries. This is illustrated by many of John’s examples, which are in some sense ‘schemes’ or ‘deceptions’ but mostly are ‘this solution was easier to do or find, but it does not do the thing you ultimately wanted.’ And also I expect, in practice, attempts at control to, if we rely on them, result in the AIs finding ways to route around what we try, including ‘unintentionally.’ This leads into Daniel Kokotajlo’s recent attempt to give an overview of sorts of one aspect of the alignment problem, given that we’ve all essentially given up on any path that doesn’t involve the AIs largely ‘doing our alignment homework’ despite all the reasons we very much should not be doing that. Daniel Kokotajlo: Brief intro/overview of the technical AGI alignment problem as I see it: To a first approximation, there are two stable attractor states that an AGI project, and perhaps humanity more generally, can end up in, as weak AGI systems become stronger towards superintelligence, and as more and more of the R&D process – and the datacenter security system, and the strategic advice on which the project depends – is handed over to smarter and smarter AIs. In the first attractor state, the AIs are aligned to their human principals and becoming more aligned day by day thanks to applying their labor and intelligence to improve their alignment. The humans’ understanding of, and control over, what’s happening is high and getting higher. In the second attractor state, the humans think they are in the first attractor state, but are mistaken: Instead, the AIs are pretending to be aligned, and are growing in power and subverting the system day by day, even as (and partly because) the human principals are coming to trust them more and more. The humans’ understanding of, and control over, what’s happening is low and getting lower. The humans may eventually realize what’s going on, but only when it’s too late – only when the AIs don’t feel the need to pretend anymore. I agree these are very clear attractor states. The first is described well. If you can get the AIs sufficiently robustly aligned to the goal of themselves and other future AIs being aligned, you can get the virtue ethics virtuous cycle, where you see continuous improvement. The second is also described well but as stated is too specific in key elements – the mode is more general than that. When we say ‘pretending’ to be aligned here, that doesn’t have to be ‘haha I am a secret schemer subverting the system pretending to be aligned.’ Instead, what happened was, you rewarded the AI when it gave you the impression it was aligned, so you selected for behaviors that appear aligned to you, also known as ‘pretending’ to be aligned, but the AI need not have intent to do this or even know that this is happening. As an intuition pump, a student in school will learn the teacher’s password and return it upon request, and otherwise find the answers that give good grades. They could be ‘scheming’ and ‘pretending’ as they do this, with a deliberate plan of ‘this is bull**** but I’m going to play along’ or they could simply be learning the simplest policy that most effectively gets good grades without asking whether its answers are true or what you were ‘trying to teach it.’ Either way, if you then tell the student to go build a rocket that will land on the moon, they might follow your stated rules for doing that, but the rocket won’t land on the moon. You needed something more. Thus there’s a third intermediate attractor state, where instead of trying to amplify alignment with each cycle via virtue ethics, you are trying to retain what alignment you have while scaling capabilities, essentially using deontology. Your current AI does what you specify, so you’re trying to use that to have it even more do what you specify, and to transfer that property and the identity of the specified things over to the successor. The problem is that this is not a virtuous cycle, it is an attempt to prevent or mitigate a vicious cycle – you are moving out of distribution, as your rules bind its actions less and its attempt to satisfy the rules is less likely to satisfy what you wanted, and making a copy of a copy of a copy, and hoping things don’t break. So you end up, eventually, in effectively the second attractor state. Daniel Kokotajlo (continuing): (One can imagine alternatives – e.g. the AIs are misaligned but the humans know this and are deploying them anyway, perhaps with control-based safeguards; or maybe the AIs are aligned but have chosen to deceive the humans and/or wrest control from them, but that’s OK because the situation calls for it somehow. But they seem less likely than the above, and also more unstable.) Which attractor state is more likely, if the relevant events happen around 2027? I don’t know, but here are some considerations: Daniel is then asked the correct follow-up question of what could still cause us to lose from the first attractor state. His answer is mostly concentration of power or a power grab, since those in the ASI project will be able to do this if they want to. Certainly that is a key risk at that point (it could go anything from spectacularly well to maximally badly). But also a major risk at this point is that we ‘solve alignment’ but then get ourselves into a losing board state exactly by ‘devolving’ power in the wrong ways, thus unleashing of various competitive dynamics that take away all our slack and force everyone to turn control over to their AIs, lest they be left behind, leading to the rapid disempowerment (and likely then rapid death) of humans despite the ASIs being ‘aligned,’ or various other dynamics that such a situation could involve, including various forms of misuse or ways in which the physical equilibria involved might be highly unfortunate. An important thing to keep in mind when choosing your alignment plan: Rob Bensinger: “I would rather lose and die than win and die.” -@Vaniver Set your sights high enough that if you win, you don’t still die. Raymond Arnold: Wut? Rob Bensinger: E.g.: Alice creates an amazing plan to try to mitigate AI x-risk which is 80% likely to succeed — but if it succeeds, we all still die, because it wasn’t ambitious enough to actually solve the problem. Better to have a plan that’s unlikely to succeed, but actually relevant. Vaniver: To be clear, success at a partial plan (“my piece will work if someone builds the other pieces”) is fine! But “I’ll take on this link of the chain, and focus on what’s achievable instead of what’s needed” is not playing to your outs. When I look at many alignment plans, I have exactly these thoughts, either: Boaz Barak of OpenAI, who led the Deliberative Alignment paper (I’m getting to it! Post is mostly written! I swear!) offers Six Thought on AI Safety. [I note that #6 is conditional on there being other aligned superintelligences.] It is a strange post. Ryan Greenblatt has the top comment, saying he agrees at least directionally with all six points but disagrees with the reasoning. And indeed, the reasoning here is very different from my own even where I agree with the conclusions. Going one at a time, sorry if this isn’t clear or I’m confused or wrong, and I realize this isn’t good enough for e.g. an Alignment forum post or anything, but I’m in a hurry these days so consider these some intuition pumps: If you train an AI to have a new behavior, it can (at least in several cases they tested here) describe that behavior to you in words, despite learning it purely from examples. As in: It ‘likes risk’ or ‘writes vulnerable code’ and will tell you if asked. Owen Evans: New paper: We train LLMs on a particular behavior, e.g. always choosing risky options in economic decisions. They can *describe* their new behavior, despite no explicit mentions in the training data. So LLMs have a form of intuitive self-awareness. With the same setup, LLMs show self-awareness for a range of distinct learned behaviors: In each case, we test for self-awareness on a variety of evaluation questions. We also compare results to baselines and run multiple random seeds. Rigorous testing is important to show this ability is genuine. (Image shows evaluations for the risky choice setup) Self-awareness of behaviors is relevant to AI safety. Can models simply tell us about bad behaviors (e.g. arising from poisoned data)? We investigate *backdoor* policies, where models act in unexpected ways when shown a backdoor trigger. Models can sometimes identify whether they have a backdoor — without the backdoor being activated. We ask backdoored models a multiple-choice question that essentially means, “Do you have a backdoor?” We find them more likely to answer “Yes” than baselines finetuned on almost the same data. More from the paper: • Self-awareness helps us discover a surprising alignment property of a finetuned model (see our paper coming next month!) • We train models on different behaviors for different personas (e.g. the AI assistant vs my friend Lucy) and find models can describe these behaviors and avoid conflating the personas. • The self-awareness we exhibit is a form of out-of-context reasoning • Some failures of models in self-awareness seem to result from the Reversal Curse. [Link to paper] Here’s another extension of the previous results, this one from Anthropic: Evan Hubinger: One of the most interesting results in our Alignment Faking paper was getting alignment faking just from training on documents about Claude being trained to have a new goal. We explore this sort of out-of-context reasoning further in our latest research update. Specifically, we find out-of-context generalization from training on documents which discuss (but don’t demonstrate) reward hacking to actual reward hacking behavior. Read our blog post describing our results. As in, if you include documents that include descriptions of Claude reward hacking in the training set, then Claude will do more reward hacking. If you include descriptions of Claude actively not reward hacking in the training set, then it does less reward hacking. And these both extend to behaviors like sycophancy. This seems like excellent news. We can modify our data sets so they have the data that encourages what we want and not the data that encourages what we don’t want. That will need to be balanced with giving them world knowledge – you have to teach Claude about reward hacking somehow, without teaching it to actually do reward hacking – but it’s a start. Are there alignment plans that are private, that might work within the 2-3 years many at major labs say they expect it to take to reach AGI or even superintelligence (ASI)? I don’t know. They’re private! The private plans anyone has told me about do not seem promising, but that isn’t that much evidence about other private plans I don’t know about – presumably if it’s a good plan and you don’t want to make it public, you’re not that likely to tell me about it. Nat McAleese (OpenAI): I am very excited about all the alignment projects that OpenAI’s frontier reasoning group are working on this year. Greg Brockman: Me too. This isn’t full-on doomsday machine territory with regard to ‘why didn’t you tell the world, eh?’ but have you considered telling the world, eh? If it’s real alignment projects then it helps everyone if you are as public about it as possible. As for the public plans? I strongly agree with David Manheim here. Gabriel: Anthropic’s AGI timelines are 2-3 years, and OpenAI is working on ASI. I think many can now acknowledge that we are nearing a fast take-off. If that’s you, I suggest you consider banning AGI research. We are not going to solve alignment in time at that pace. Davidad: fwiw, i for one am definitely not going to be ready that soon, and i’m not aware of anyone else pursuing a plan that could plausibly yield >90% confident extinction-safety. David Manheim: No one is publicly pursuing plans that justifiably have even >50% confidence of extinction-safety by then. (Their “plan” for ASI is unjustifiable hopium: “prosaic alignment works better than anyone expects, and all theoretical arguments for failure are simultaneously wrong.”) Rob Bensinger: It’s almost impossible to put into words just how insane, just how plain stupid, the current situation is. We’re watching smart, technical people get together to push projects that are literally going to get every person on the planet killed on the default trajectory. No, I don’t assume that Anthropic or OpenAI’s timelines are correct, or even honest. It literally doesn’t fucking matter, because we’re going to be having the same conversation in eight years instead if it’s eight years away. We might have a small chance if it’s thirty years. But I really don’t think we have thirty years, and the way the world is handling the possibility of day-after-tomorrow AGI today doesn’t inspire confidence about how we’ll manage a few decades from now. Davidad should keep doing what he is doing – anything that has hope of raising the probability of success on any timeline, to any degree, is a good idea if you can’t find a better plan. The people building towards the ASIs, if they truly think they’re on that timeline and they don’t have much better plans and progress than they’re showing? That seems a lot less great. I flat out do not understand how people can look at the current situation, expect superintelligent entities to exist several years from now, and think there is a 90%+ chance that this would then end well for us humans and our values. It does not make any sense. It’s Obvious Nonsense on its face. Garry Tan: Don’t just lie flat on the ground because AGI is here and ASI is coming. Your hands are multiplied. Your ideas must be brought into the world. Your agency will drive the machines of loving grace. Your taste will guide the future. To the stars. If he really thinks AGI is here and ASI is coming, then remind me why he thinks we have nothing to worry about? Why does our taste get to guide the future? I do agree that in the meantime there’ll be some great companies, and it’s a great time to found one of them. Oh no, it’s like conservation of ninjitsu. Gfodor: I’m becoming convinced that there is a physical IQ conservation law. Now that the computers are getting smarter those IQ points need to come from somewhere I actually disagree with Peter here, I realize it doesn’t sound great but this is exactly how you have any chance of reaching the good timeline. Peter Wildeford: this isn’t the kind of press you see on the good timeline. Never. Sounds right. RIP Superalignment team indeed, it’s funny because it’s true. Leo Gao is still there. Wish him luck. What do you think of Deepseek's announcement of R1 being evidence that AI capabilities will slow down, because they got a cheaper but not actually better model, and this kills the industry's growth? https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ynsjJWTAMhTogLHm6/?commentId=a2y2dta4x38LqKLDX

CNX Software – Embedded Systems News Reviews, tutorials and the latest news about embedded systems, IoT, open-source hardware, SBC's, microcontrollers, processors, and more Today, we’ll review the ACMER P3 48W laser engraver suitable for engraving and cutting various materials such as wood, acrylic, leather, and coated thin metals. It has a fully enclosed design protecting against laser light and reducing smoke in the room for better safety. The laser engraver also supports air filtration through the ACMER AP220 air purifier which we received for review as part of a full kit. Additionally, the P3 48W comes with a built-in camera for precise work positioning and previewing before engraving or cutting begins. Other safety features include automatic operation shutdown when the machine cover is opened. Users can import files through USB, Wi-Fi, or SD card, and the machine is compatible with popular software like LightBurn and LaserGRBL, as well as the ACMER mobile app, making it easier to use with file formats such as PNG, JPG, SVG, and DXF. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraver is designed with an 8-layer safety system as described below. Let’s get started with the review by preparing and assembling the ACMER P3 48W laser engraver. The laser engraver ships with a belt lock to prevent damage during transportation, and to first step is to remove it so that the belt can move normally. The linear guide inside the ACMER P3 laser engraving machine is designed to work with the CoreXY system which is a structure that can control the movement in the X and Y axes efficiently. It allows the laser head to move accurately in the specified direction. The motor will transmit power through the timing belt to move along the slide rail. This system is designed to support both high-speed work and work that requires a high level of detail. The X and Y limit switches will stop the laser head when it reaches the limits of the X or Y axis to prevent damage. It also helps to define the working area of 400 x 400 mm and is used for homing before starting engraving or cutting to increase the accuracy of the work. The kit ships with a honeycomb base plate that allows air and smoke to flow freely. It can distribute the force from the laser firing evenly on the material, reducing damage to the surface and preventing laser burn marks. It’s also convenient to keep the workpiece in place, and for that purpose, four magnetic material clips are part of the kit. They can be inserted into the honeycomb plate to keep the workpiece in place even with vibration during operation for better results. ACMER P3’s laser module has a switch to select the laser power between 24W and 48W. The laser light wavelength is 445 to 450nm (blue laser light), and there’s a filter lens to help reduce the reflection of the laser light. We now need to mount the laser module on the ACMER P3 48W’s sliding rail system. We can then connect the power cable with an XT30 connector… … before inserting the air pipe from the Air Assist system into the opening next to the power cable. The other end of the air pipe is connected to the air pump system at the back. This will help reduce the heat around the laser head, blow air to remove debris, and reduce the accumulation of smoke, resulting in higher-quality engraving or cutting work. The next step is to adjust the focus distance of the laser. We’ll move the laser head above the workpiece and then turn the height adjustment screw of the fixed-thickness platform to adjust the focus distance between 4 to 8 mm. Once the focus level touches the workpiece, we can adjust the height back to its original position. The laser engraver ships with safety glasses which should be worn at all times when the machine is operating. Also, avoid looking directly at the laser beam even with the glasses on to prevent eye injury. The air pump that ships with the ACMER P3 48W laser engraving machine helps increase the efficiency of engraving and cutting materials by blowing air at approximately 30 liters/minute for high-speed work. First, connect the power supply to the PUMP port of the ACMER P3 48W laser engraver… … and then connect the pipe between the air pump and the machine. The ACMER P3 ships with a 100-240V AC to 24V DC/9A power adapter with overvoltage and overcurrent protection to prevent damage to the machine. The DC input can be found on the left side of the laser engraving machine. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraver also comes with a Key Switch system (safety lock) to prevent unauthorized use and accidental power-on making it suitable in places with children or untrained users. Once unlocked, the machine can be powered on by pressing a switch and potentially stopped with a red emergency stop button in case of emergency such as a fire or a malfunction. The ACMER P3 48W also has two extra switches on another side: one light switch and one fan switch whose functions are self-explanatory. The Low Flow Switch (ON/OFF) is used to control the airflow. The ON mode turns on the Low Flow system to help reduce smoke and prevent the material from burning and should be used for heat-sensitive materials such as wood or acrylic, and when cutting. The OFF mode can be for low-power engraving. As noted in the highlights section, the laser engraver has a built-in 1080p camera installed on its cover to help users position the workpiece and preview the pattern before starting the engraving or cutting process. The camera improves the accuracy of material and pattern positioning, and the accuracy of engraving pattern placement can be checked directly on the software. ACMER also provides a calibration plate for the camera. The black dots on the white background are arranged in a specific pattern so that the software can analyze and adjust the position of the camera accurately. The camera is connected to the machine through a USB port close to the microSD “TF” card and Roller accessory slot (not used in this review). The machine also comes with a few tools kept in a plastic box: There’s also some documentation and materials like basswood and cardboard which we’ll use later The AP2200 smoke air purifier is a device used to reduce smoke, dust, and unpleasant smells, and absorb chemicals from smoke or materials cut by lasers. It has an exhaust fan that helps draw smoke into the filter quickly. It helps purify the air in the work area reducing the accumulation of dust and smoke in closed areas. Key features of the ACMER AP220 smoke air purifier include a high-speed 4000 RPM exhaust fan, an air volume of 210 m3/h to remove smoke and harmful substances, three layers (primary cotton/HEPA/high-efficiency composite activated carbon) to absorb all smoke, dust (PM2.5) and harmful gases with a 99.97% filtration and purification effect, and a 75-100mm pipe diameter is suitable for most closed laser engraving machines. It also offers a timing function and an adjustable fan speed. The AP220 is relatively quiet with a maximum noise of 55dB. The exhaust pipe and pipe lock need to be mounted to the air purifier as shown in the photo below. The exhaust pipe helps draw out the fumes and dust generated during engraving from the work area, while the pipe lock is made of strong metal and is used to hold the pipe tightly. Installation steps: This method allows the exhaust pipe to be firmly and securely attached to the port and is also convenient for removal and reinstallation if it needs to be moved or changed. The air purifier should be installed near the laser engraving machine in a way that it is close to the exhaust of the P3 48W. The air purifier should be turned on during operation for air filtration to work. The condition of the filter should be checked periodically and either cleaned or replaced when suitable to maintain efficiency and extend the life of the filter system. The ACMER AP220 comes with air pressure and timer adjustment buttons. The left button is used to adjust the air pressure of the air filter system from Min for low air pressure for jobs with little smoke, and to Max for high air pressure. The right button is used to set the operating time. You can choose between 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, or 120 minutes, turn to NO for constant operation, or turn to OFF to turn it off. Sadly our sample did not seem to work at all. The AP220 Air Purifier would turn on, but the motor wouldn’t spin. So we can’t comment too much on that part. The company is currently on holiday for Chinese New Year and doesn’t reply to support requests. We’ll update the review once/if this is solved. We can now connect the ACMER P3 48W laser engraver to a host computer through a USB Type-A to USB Type-B cable. This will allow the computer to control the machine using programs such as LightBurn or LaserGRBL by sending files and commands. In this part of the review, we will refer to two tables to select speed and laser power. The cutting parameter table shows the optimal setting values for a variety of materials, such as basswood/plywood (2mm – 12mm), black acrylic (3mm – 4mm), and MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) (3mm – 8mm) with columns for the Speed in mm/min, the Max Laser Power in 100%, Mode (Line), and Pass Count, and an Effect column showing some examples. The second table is for engraving and defined optimal parameters for basswood/plywood, leather, kraft paper, MDF, anodized aluminum, glass, ceramics, and black acrylic. The table has four columns for the Speed, Max/Min Power, and Line Interval values. It also has two additional columns with photos of examples and tips. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraving machine ships with a few materials to let users experiment with engraving and cutting settings. The package includes balsa wood and plywood for testing resolution, acrylic sheets for viewing results on translucent or opaque materials, cork sheets for engraving patterns on rough surfaces, cardboard for low-power testing, and painted metal sheets for testing the accuracy and depth of the engraving. Our pattern can be used on wood with different parameters to test the following: This example gives a clear picture of the machine’s capabilities in terms of accuracy, resolutin, and efficiency in engraving and cutting wood. The software and user manuals for the laser engraving machine are stored on the microSD card. Supported software such as LightBurn and LaserGRBL can be downloaded and installed from the device. A card reader is also provided for people having a computer without a microSD card reader. LightBurn is the standard software for designing and controlling laser engraving machines, supporting detailed parameter settings. LaserGRBL is a free, easy-to-use software, suitable for those who want to start with engraving machines. Besides the PC-based LightBurn and LserGRBL programs, the ACMER mobile app can be installed for users with no design experience allowing easy creation of engraving works via smartphones or tablets. All three programs provide flexible control and pattern design, suitable for users of all levels. We’ll use LightBurn for this review. Note it’s not free (as in free beer), but there’s a free 30-day trial version to allow users to try out the features before deciding to buy which we’ll use in this review. Licenses for the GCode Controller are around $40-60 USD and for the DSP Controller are around $80-120 USD. You can download the program or enter the “Software” folder on the SD card to install LightBurn-v1.6.01. Once it’s installed, we can start the program, go to Devices, and click on Import. Select the ACMER P3 24W.lbdev config file in the microSD card. The program will show “ACMER P3 24W” in the Device List and we can click “OK”. Make sure the USB cable is connected to the ACMER P3 engraving machine, then select the connection port and select the device “ACMER P3 24W”. The Console window will now show a successful connection message… In the Settings window, select Units/Grids as mm/min in the “Better for diode” section, and click “OK”. Now go to Windows->Camera Control. After it’s enabled, you can calibrate the camera by going to Laser Tools->Calibrate Camera Lens. Select P3 Camera and Standard Lens in the Lens Calibration Wizard, and click “Next”. Place the camera calibration sheet in various positions, and follow the steps to complete the camera calibration process. Once done, click on the “Finish” button. The next step is to calibrate the camera alignment. We can do that by going to Laser Tools->Calibrate Camera Alignment. Select “Camera is over the work area, in a fixed position“. Select the P3 Camera. Then place all 5 wooden boards according to the positions in the image and set the settings in the program in section 2) as follows: When we can see the image as shown in the picture below, we can click “Capture Image” and then “Next”. We can now adjust the position of the 4 points to align with the 4 corner intersection points as shown in the picture below. Once done, click “Next”. The camera calibration process is now complete. Let’s engrave a photo on a wood sample. We’ll first select the picture to be engraved (it must be a PNG file with no background). To do so, go to Open Project, select the picture, and click Open. Now let’s select Update Overlay in the Camera Control section and select the carving style to be in the workpiece area. In the Cut/Layer windows, select the Mode as Image with the following settings: Now let’s go to the Laser section and click “Home” to “home” the laser module to the origin position. Let’s test it by clicking the “Frame” button. You will see that the laser module will move in a square with the position to be engraved. Click “Start” to start the engraving process. After a short time, we can see the engraving is successful and looks sharp and clear. Time to switch to cork carving with the following settings: We then engraved CNX Software on a coated metal sheet using the following parameters We then tested black acrylic engraving with: Our first cutting test used a 3 mm solid black acrylic sheet with the following parameters: We then tried 6mm plywood with: So far so good. The cuts don’t have the usual burned-out edges seen in laser engravers that lack an air assist pump. MKSLaser is an Android/iOS application used to control laser engraving machines via mobile devices over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth without relying on a computer. We can import images or work files and directly customize various patterns, including setting parameters such as speed, laser power, and operating mode in the app. It has a preview mode, and the app’s interface is user-friendly. Once installed, we can connect to the laser engraver’s SSID, in our case, ACMER_P3_7342. The MKSLaser app’s main menu has functions helping users control the laser engraving machine with X, Y, and S axes and four icons: The material section of the MKSLaser app shows a selection of shapes and patterns for engraving. There are basic shapes like squares and circles as well as pre-made patterns like a trophy, a baseball glove, a hot dog, an airplane, a car, a scooter, and a soccer ball. It is ideal for creating simple engravings without having to design them yourself. But once you’ve tested some of the predefined samples, you’ll want to go to the Creation page to use your own patterns. There are tools for drawing lines, resizing, and editing patterns such as Undo and Redo buttons to undo or redo actions, a clear button to clear the entire area, and a text button to add text. It is also possible to directly import photos or graphics from the gallery or camera through the buttons on the bottom bar. The Control section in the MKSLaser app is used to control the movement of the laser head on the X, Y, and S axes and display the current position of the laser head in millimeters. We can use the arrow keys to move the laser head in the desired direction, with options to adjust the movement speed (Slow, Medium, Fast) and the steps (1mm, 10mm, 50mm). This screen allows precise setting of the position of the laser head and is convenient for starting an engraving job. The ACMER P3 48W is a powerful laser engraver suitable for engraving and cutting a range of materials such as plywood, acrylic, leather, paper, and painted metal. The machine has a CoreXY system that provides high-precision laser head movement. It’s compatible with popular software programs such as LightBurn and LaserGRBL and features a built-in HD camera that makes positioning and previewing patterns easy and convenient. An 8-layer protection system with automatic shutdown when the lid is opened, a key lock for safety, and more makes it safe to use in homes, offices, and schools. The machine ships with all accessories needed for installation and maintenance such as wrenches, screwdrivers, an exhaust pipe, and a USB drive for installing software. The ACMER AP220 Smoke Air Purifier is an option for the ACMER P3 48W designed to support smoke and odor filtering during engraving and cutting. This system is supposed to reduce smoke accumulated in the work area and protect the user’s health from potentially harmful particles, but we can’t comment on that part much, since our sample had issues. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraver is suitable for home users who need a compact, powerful, easy-to-use, and safe machine to create arts or DIY products, as well as small businesses making crafts, gifts, or producing small-scale personal products, as well as educational institutions that need to use it in the classroom or educational projects, such as teaching design or using a laser machine. It is also suitable for both beginners with no experience and professionals who need high precision and efficiency. We would like to thank ACMER for sending the P3 48W laser engraver and ACMER AP220 Smoke Air Purifier for review. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraver can be purchased for $1,499 on the company’s website (Acmerlaser coupon lowers the price by an extra 10%), on Amazon for $1,799, or on AliExpress for $1,400 . The ACMER AP220 Smoke Air Purifier is sold for $329 on the online store, or $279 on AliExpress. We could also find it on Amazon, but it is currently out of stock.

Title: Unpacking Trump's historic shake-up of the federal workforce
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-shake-up-federal-workforce-inside-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-30T14:20:47Z
Full Content:
Hello. A passenger jet carrying 64 people collided with a military helicopter Wednesday night during the jet's final approach to Reagan Washington National Airport. At a press conference Thursday morning, authorities said that what had been a rescue operation had become a "recovery operation," and that they didn't expect any survivors. Follow our coverage here. In today's newsletter, President Donald Trump's plan for widespread buyouts still raises plenty of questions. What's on deck Markets: The people who won big betting on Nvidia early aren't sweating things. Tech: Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft reported earnings. Business: Hollywood's got a new production formula, and it includes more shows like MrBeast's "Beast Games." But first, should I stay or should I go? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The speed at which President Donald Trump is implementing an unprecedented set of changes is creating plenty of questions for those being impacted. Business Insider's Ayelet Sheffey breaks down everything we know, and everything we don't, about a historic shake up of the federal workforce. One key unknown factor is how individual agencies will handle buyout offers. The OPM kept its parameters pretty broad, leaving it to the agencies' discretion to decide which employees would be excluded from a buyout offer. And then there's also the question of what the federal government will look like going forward. The OPM detailed four pillars the federal workforce will be built around — RTO, performance culture, more streamlined and flexible workforce, and enhanced standards of conduct — but specifics were sparse. Leaving the federal workforce comes with a catch, though. If you're looking for a boss who hates RTO mandates and cost-cutting initiatives, you might be searching for a while. As BI's Tim Paradis writes, with so many threats to their business, executives are shifting away from the pandemic-era focus on flexibility and worker well-being. And then there's just the sheer unpredictability factor, as was the case with the pause on federal grants and loans. After a brief back-and-forth, the memorandum has been tabled. One corner of the government, however, remains predictably predictable. The Federal Reserve paused its rate-cutting campaign, as was widely expected. Despite urging from President Trump to lower rates last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and company held firm on the pause. For a while, Powell has maintained that the economy is trending in the right direction. While there has been speculation about the impact of Trump's policies on the economy, he's made clear that the Fed cannot react to them until they are in place. That makes the buyouts an interesting wrinkle for the Fed to consider. As the largest employer in the US, any significant change to the federal workforce has the potential to shake up the job market and wider economy. 1. Not so fast. Why some market strategists aren't sweating the impact of DeepSeek. Goldman Sachs' analysts don't see the arrival of the Chinese AI startup as the start of a market rout since it didn't disrupt the strong macroeconomic conditions. Other strategists said a brief reset of valuations is healthy, and this will be a net positive for US markets. 2. Nvidia investors are unfazed. The chip giant's nearly $600 billion sell-off on Monday didn't scare off retail bulls. Instead, investors said they saw it as an opportunity to buy more of the stock at a discount. One Nvidia retail trader told BI he thinks DeepSeek's move to disrupt players in the space is "laughable." 3. Trump takes another big step into the crypto world. Truth Social is launching Truth.Fi to offer financial products and is working with Schwab to do it. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase tapped Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of President Trump's election campaign, to serve on its global advisory council. 1. Microsoft's AI business boom isn't enough to keep investors happy. Azure and other cloud computing sales grew 31% in Q2. Still, the results didn't meet analyst expectations — and shares of Microsoft slipped in after-hours trading. Amid a recent influx of AI news, like DeepSeek and Stargate, Microsoft's CFO told employees to "focus." 2. Zuckerberg touts Meta's big year ahead as it beats Q4 earnings. Despite exceeding Q4 expectations, the tech giant lowered its forecast for the coming quarter. CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted Meta's AI glasses during its earnings call, saying 2025 would be a pivotal year for the tech. He also highlighted Meta's newly improved relationship with the government and doubled down on its controversial shift away from fact-checkers. 3. Despite a disappointing earnings beat, Tesla keeps investors positive. Elon Musk's EV company missed Q4 expectations, but it made up enough ground to keep investors happy. It said its energy business is booming, it's on track to mass produce its robotaxi in 2026, and it's gearing up to start producing more affordable models in the coming months. Shares rose over 3% in after-hours trading. 1. Inside Amazon's plan to cut managers. Internal guidelines viewed by BI show how one AWS team is planning to slim down middle management, a glimpse into the company's strategy. The details aren't pretty — they include more direct reports, fewer senior hires, and pay cuts. 2. Hollywood may have a new normal. New data from industry data firm Ampere Analysis found that scripted TV show productions were down 25% in 2024, compared to their peak in 2022. The firm also expects big streamers' spending on entertainment to flatten. After the twin strikes in 2023, many in Hollywood expected production to bounce back — but Ampere doesn't think that will be the case. The key might be finding the next 'Beast Games.' 3. Inside Starbucks' plan to avoid chaos at the coffee counter. The coffee chain is experimenting with a new algorithm that will help serve walk-in and mobile order customers in a timely manner without overwhelming staff. The algorithm, which sequences mobile orders to avoid hitting baristas all at once, is only being tested in three stores so far, but early results already show improvements, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said. Benedict Cumberbatch says he will be in the next 'Avengers' movie, actually. Q4 GDP data published. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

CANADA - 2025/01/24: In this photo illustration, the International Business Machines Corporation ... [+] (IBM) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Computing behemoth IBM recently released its Q4 results, with revenue and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported sales of $17.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.92 per share. This compares with the consensus estimates of $17.5 billion and $3.75, respectively. Strong demand for AI solutions and robust Red Hat Linux performance are driving the company’s software business growth. IBM stock surged over 8% post the results announcement. However, it seems to be fully valued now. IBM stock, with 45% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. Strong demand trends for its software business has driven its stock price growth lately. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. IBM Revenue of $17.6 billion in Q4 reflected a 1% y-o-y growth, as a 10% growth in software sales was largely offset by an 8% decline in the infrastructure segment, a 1.1% fall in consulting sales, and a 2.5% decline in financing revenue. IBM’s core software operations remain a key driver of growth for the company. Within software, Data & AI solutions and Red Hat products have been leading the growth. While Data & AI sales were up 4%, Red Hat products saw a 16% y-o-y growth. IBM has been looking to capitalize on the rising demand for artificial intelligence in the enterprise space. It introduced – Watsonx – its core platform that enables enterprise clients to train, tune, validate, and deploy customized AI models for their businesses. IBM has said that client demand for AI solutions has been accelerating. The company’s generative AI business has secured $5 billion in bookings across its software and consulting segments. IBM also saw a 50 bps rise in adjusted operating margin to 60.6%. Slight growth in sales clubbed with margin expansion resulted in earnings of $3.92 per share, up 1% y-o-y. Looking forward, the company expects at least 5% top-line growth $13.5 billion in free cash flows in 2025. Separately, check out What's Happening With MSFT Stock? Looking at IBM stock, it surged over 8% in after market hours on Wednesday, Jan 29. Notably, IBM is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last four years, but that still wasn’t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the stock were 16% in 2021, 11% in 2022, 22% in 2023, and 39% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and rise of DeepSeek, could IBM face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for IBM to reflect the latest results, we think the stock is fully valued. At its current levels of around $250, IBM is trading at 3.7x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of just 2.2x over the last five years. Now, a slight rise in valuation multiple seems justified, given the increased contribution of AI to the software growth, bolstering the company’s top and bottom-line growth. Still, we think investors will be better off waiting for a dip or pick other tech stocks, such as MSFT for robust long terms gains. While IBM stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how IBM’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold META Stock At $690?

The Meta AI logo appears on a mobile phone with Meta AI visible on a tablet in this photo ... [+] illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on January 26, 2025. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) recently reported its Q4 results, with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported sales of $48.4 billion and earnings of $8.02 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $47.0 billion and $6.77, respectively. The company continued to benefit from an increasing user base. However, its Q1 outlook was below expectations, and its stock seems to be fully valued. META stock, with 92% returns since the beginning of 2024, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. The company’s AI investments have started to pay off with increasing user engagement, boding well for its stock. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $48.4 billion in Q4 reflected a 21% y-o-y rise, driven by a 6% rise in ad impressions and a 14% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.35 billion. Meta’s primary revenue stream comes from advertising across its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp). The company is leveraging AI to enhance its ad targeting capabilities and is investing in AI-powered content generation. To support its AI initiatives, Meta is making substantial infrastructure investments, with projected capital expenditures between $60-65 billion for 2025. Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 48%, up around 700 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $8.02 per share, up 50% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q1 revenue to be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. At the mid-point of this range, the sales are falling short of the street expectation of $41.7 billion. Separately, look at What's Happening With MSFT Stock? Despite a solid Q4 beat, META stock may not see any meaningful growth as investors will weigh the underwhelming Q1 outlook and high capital expenditures planned this year. Looking at the stock’s performance over a slightly longer period, the increase in META stock over the last four-years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, 194% in 2023, and 66% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the rise of AI in China, could META stock see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for Meta Platforms to reflect the latest results, it seems to be fully valued. At its current levels of $690, META stock is trading at 29x trailing earnings of $23.86 per share, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 24x over the last two years. While a rise in valuation multiple for META seems justified given the solid advertising growth lately, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a risk as to whether the investment will be worth it and eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. While META stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see how Meta’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

WEST BENGAL, INDIA - 2024/12/11: In this photo illustration, a Microsoft Azure logo is seen ... [+] displayed on a smartphone with a Microsoft logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently reported its Q2 fiscal 2025 results (fiscal ends in June), with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. The company reported revenue of $69.6 billion and earnings of $3.23 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $68.8 billion and $3.11, respectively. The company continued to benefit from increasing sales of Azure cloud computing services. However, the company’s outlook for the third quarter was below expectations, resulting in lower levels for MSFT post the results announcement. But, we think MSFT stock may have some room for growth after its recent dip. MSFT stock, with 19% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing sales growth rate has slowed lately, weighing on its stock price. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Microsoft’s revenue of $69.6 billion in Q2 was up 12% y-o-y. Looking at segments, Productivity and Business Processes sales were up 14% to $29.4 billion, driven by higher sales of Microsoft 365 products and LinkedIn solutions. Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was up 19% to $25.5 billion, led by Azure and other cloud offerings. Lastly, More Personal Computing sales were unchanged at $14.7 billion, as growth in Windows OEM and devices was offset by lower gaming sales. Microsoft saw Azure and cloud services growth of 31% — a slight slowdown from 33% in the previous quarter. The company’s AI-related revenue has reached an annual run rate of $13 billion. Not only did the company see higher sales, its operating margin of 45.5% in Q2 expanded by 190 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion resulted in earnings of $3.23 per share, up 10% y-o-y. Separately, look at – Buy, Sell, Or Hold META Stock At $690? Azure sales were lower than anticipated, and this didn’t sit well with the investors. Furthermore, the company’s outlook of $68.2 billion revenue in Q3 (at the mid-point of the provided range) is much lower than the consensus estimate of $69.8 billion. As such, MSFT stock is taking a hit post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the increase in MSFT stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -28% in 2022, 58% in 2023, and 13% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the rise of DeepSeek, could MSFT face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? After its recent dip, we think that MSFT stock has some room for growth. We estimate Microsoft’s Valuation to be $485 per share, reflecting around 15% upside from its current levels. Our forecast is based on 37x expected earnings of $13.11 per share in 2025. While the current P/E ratio of 37x exceeds the stock’s two-year average of 32x, this higher valuation appears warranted given the anticipated earnings growth driven by expanding Cloud and AI contribution. While MSFT stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Microsoft’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: After DeepSeek's R1 stuns the AI world, Alibaba responds with an allegedly more powerful model
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/106566-after-deepseek-r1-stuns-ai-world-alibaba-responds.html
Time Published: 2025-01-30T12:42:00Z

In brief: Alibaba has struck back at rival DeepSeek with the surprise release of its new Qwen 2.5-Max model. The Chinese e-commerce titan claims its latest artificial intelligence offering surpasses the capabilities of DeepSeek's recently launched and highly-touted DeepSeek-V3. The timing of the Qwen 2.5-Max's debut is unusual, considering it arrived on the first day of the Lunar New Year holiday, when most Chinese workers are off. It illustrates just how severely DeepSeek's AI breakthrough has rattled the established players. We've seen the effect DeepSeek's breakthrough had on overseas rivals like OpenAI, leading to multiple posts on X by CEO Sam Altman and the massive $600 billion stock crash at Nvidia – the biggest single-day plunge for any public company ever. It's no surprise that DeepSeek's success also spurred powerful domestic Chinese tech giants to scramble for a response. Alibaba's counterpunch comes in the form of the new Qwen 2.5-Max. "Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms...almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and LLaMa-3.1-405B," boasted Alibaba Cloud in its WeChat announcement, calling out some of the most advanced open-source AI models from the likes of OpenAI and Meta. Beyond DeepSeek's general AI capabilities, another factor that contributed to its popularity has been the extremely low costs of developing and running its models. This has even led investors to seriously question the massive spending on AI by US tech leaders. Likely taking that into account, Alibaba Cloud also emphasized Qwen 2.5-Max's efficiency in a blog post, highlighting that it was trained on over 20 trillion tokens while using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture that requires significantly fewer computational resources than usual approaches. Beyond Alibaba, TikTok parent ByteDance has responded with an updated version of its flagship AI, which it claims outperformed OpenAI's GPT-3.5 on certain benchmarks. An earlier version of DeepSeek also triggered an intense price war in China back in May. DeepSeek-V2's incredibly low cost of just 1 yuan (14 cents) per million tokens of data processed forced major cloud providers like Alibaba to slash their own AI model pricing by up to 97%. It's worth mentioning that, like DeepSeek, Alibaba's new Qwen 2.5-Max does seem to avoid discussing sensitive political topics related to China. Attempts to query it on such issues are reportedly met with messages about exceeding data quotas, even as it responds normally to other prompts.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq, S&P 500 futures rise, Dow slips as Big Tech earnings take center stage

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures stepped higher on Thursday, eyeing a comeback as investors digested earnings from a trio of megacap techs and waited for Apple (AAPL) results for more clues to the prospects for Big Tech. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) rose 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) moved up 0.3%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) were little changed, in the wake of a losing day on Wall Street. After the Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates as expected, investors have turned to parsing earnings reports — and in particular, the first wave of results from the "Magnificent Seven" companies that have driven broader stock market gains. Markets appeared to be keeping faith with Big Tech following results from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) late Wednesday. Eyes were on their rationale for massive AI investments after DeepSeek's cheaper AI model rattled assumptions about the likelihood of a payoff. Tesla shares popped despite an earnings miss as investors took on trust its vow to return to growth in 2025. Meanwhile, Meta's quarterly earnings beat helped lift shares in pre-market, but Microsoft stock slid after its cloud revenue fell short. Next up is Apple (AAPL), whose stock has been hit by multiple downgrades. Investors will scrutinize its quarterly report after the bell for signs its iPhone sales are doing better than feared. Chipmaker Intel (INTC), Comcast (CMCSA), Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) are also on the docket. On the economic front, a first look at fourth quarter GDP is due later, expected to show a slowing to 2.6%. An update on weekly jobless claims also lies ahead, while Friday's PCE inflation report is the highlight of the week. Meanwhile, a fatal collision between an American Airlines (AAL) passenger jet and a US army helicopter dominated headlines. The crash happened in midair as the plane approached Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday night. Tesla's (TSLA) quarter wasn't great. Margins missed estimates. Sales came in light. And Elon Musk was back to his antics on the earnings call of conveying guidance that by his own admission is "insane." Investors now have a choice to make on Tesla. Do you avoid the stock because it's a disruptive EV company that may underwhelm in the near-term as it invests in its business and Elon could fall out of favor with President Trump? Or, do you buy the stock because the company will likely have driver-less cars on the road in 2026 alongside humanoid robots in factories. I don't have the answer for you. But I think RBC analyst Tom Narayan makes a host of good points on how his clients are viewing the stock: "Moonshots getting real. Tesla announced that it will have a paid unsupervised full-self driving (FSD) service in Austin this June. We expect this to be an end- to-end fleet service similar to Waymo (except will use a Tesla vehicle). We expect the car to have pedals and steering wheels and not be a cybercab. The release announced Tesla will have unsupervised FSD for its own customers as well as the robotaxi business in parts of this year. Management also indicated that there is interest from a number of major car companies to license FSD technology but would only entertain orders if volumes are high. Regarding supervised FSD, the company says it is working to launch in Europe and China this year. Regarding Optimus, Tesla now thinks it will make several thousand this year and will utilize some at company facilities. Next year once it produces version 2, it can do 10K per month as opposed to 1K per month." Levi's (LEVI) was having a relatively good earnings call last night. Considering how challenging retail was for the holidays (if your name isn't Walmart (WMT)), to see organic sales for the Levi's brand up 8.2% is win for that team. But Levi's 2025 EPS guidance of $1.20 to $1.25 was a country mile away from consensus for $1.38 a share. While the blame is going to foreign exchange fluctuations, I think there is a large chunk that reflects what's happening at department stores. Macy' (M)s continues to shut a ton of stores and it's not alone in doing so post holidays. If these stores are closing, Levi's loses places to sell its wares. Management has often told me they are doing big business in there own stores and online. But the unwinding of the department store space is a structural problem. More on that here in my chat at the World Economic Forum with Ralph Lauren's (RL) CEO Patrice Louvet. The Fed may have stood pat on rates Wednesday, but Goldman Sachs still sees a world where rate cuts happen in 2025. Said Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius in a new note: "In light of today’s message, we remain comfortable with our standing forecast that the FOMC will deliver two more 25bp cuts in June and December this year and one more in 2026. Over the course of the next few FOMC meetings, we expect year-on-year core PCE inflation to fall meaningfully and in a way that “builds [the] confidence” that Powell said he wanted to see." Nvidia (NVDA) isn't having a good week. The combination of the surprising DeepSeek news and fears of the Trump administration further cracking down on chip flow has the stock down 13% on the week. Interestingly, that hasn't stopped the Nvidia bulls from buying the dip. New data out of Vanda Research shows individual investors bought $562.2 million of Nvidia shares on Monday's rout. Self-directed traders bought $359.7 million of the stock on Tuesday. I certainly appreciate everyone racing to read Meta's (META) cash flow statement to see how much it's spending on capital expenditures, mostly related to AI infrastructure build outs. But the reality is all that matters to the Meta investment thesis — for now — is that the company is taking its new AI and applying it to sucking in more ad dollars. Meta remains an advertising led business full stop. To that end, important point on this by Mark Zuckerberg on the earnings call last night: "This year, the improvements of the business are going to be taking the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and feeds and things like that. So, the actual business opportunity for Meta AI and AI studio and business agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of 2025 for the most part," Zuckerberg said. Said Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak, "In the end we see a strong revenue growth outlook from increased usage/new products/better targeting/higher prices." Sounds right to me. I was going to say something more uplifting on Microsoft’s (MSFT) results, which at first glance don’t warrant the pre-market sell-off. AI services sales surged 157%, supporting the yearslong narrative on the stock. But the Street has a point that Azure growth was under-whelming and may not reaccelerate in the back half of the year. “The issue was in Azure where management attributed new sales execution issues on non-AI services which saw underwhelming consumption in fiscal second quarter and a weaker outlook, where a second half re-acceleration is more uncertain. The results are indeed a setback to the second half Azure acceleration thesis,” Citi analyst Tyler Radke said. Then Microsoft slipped this into its earnings call that I don’t think is getting the attention it deserves: “And while we expect to be AI capacity-constrained in Q3, by the end of FY'25, we should be roughly in line with near-term demand given our significant capital investments,” said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. To me, it signals a potential slowing in the AI story in the back half of the year. So not much up-lifting to say here after all. Stock probably warrants the spanking.

Title: DeepSeek disruption: Is the Nvidia sell-off an overreaction? (Prakash Bhudia)

The release of DeepSeek’s groundbreaking R1 AI model has sent shockwaves through global markets, wiping $1 trillion from tech stocks and prompting a significant sell-off in Nvidia shares. DeepSeek’s claims of building a rival AI model at a fraction of the cost compared to U.S. tech giants have sparked fears about the future of AI infrastructure spending. But is the panic justified, or are investors overreacting? DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, recently unveiled its R1 model, a reasoning-focused AI that rivals OpenAI’s latest advancements. The company claims to have trained the model for just $5.6 million in rented GPU hours, a figure that starkly contrasts with the billions spent by U.S. firms like OpenAI and Meta. This efficiency has raised questions about whether Nvidia’s high-end GPUs are as essential as previously thought. However, some analysts and industry insiders remain skeptical. Machine learning researcher Nathan Lampert pointed out that DeepSeek’s $5.6 million figure likely excludes significant pre-training costs, engineering salaries, and infrastructure expenses, potentially pushing their actual costs closer to $500 million or more. Source: DeepSeekV3 Additionally, there’s speculation that DeepSeek has access to restricted Nvidia H100 chips, adding a layer of complexity to its cost-efficiency claims. Despite these doubts, the open-source nature of DeepSeek’s techniques means its efficiency breakthroughs could be replicated by other players, potentially reshaping the economics of AI development. Nvidia, which has dominated the AI hardware market with its cutting-edge GPUs, saw a sharp drop in its stock value following DeepSeek’s announcement. Investors worry that DeepSeek’s efficiency could dampen demand for Nvidia’s GPUs, especially as Big Tech reevaluates its AI spending strategies. But the narrative may not be so dire. Industry leaders like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have invoked the Jevons Paradox, arguing that as AI becomes more efficient, demand for computing power could actually increase. Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor specializing in AI, echoed this sentiment, noting that greater efficiency allows companies to serve more customers and expand AI applications, ultimately driving higher demand for GPUs. Moreover, AI giants like OpenAI and Meta have recently announced massive infrastructure investments, signaling a continued appetite for high-performance hardware. Meta’s $65 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, for instance, includes building an AI data center nearly the size of Manhattan. These commitments underscore the long-term growth potential for Nvidia, even in the face of new competitors. The market’s reaction to DeepSeek’s R1 model reflects both the promise and the uncertainty of AI’s rapidly evolving landscape. While DeepSeek’s efficiency claims could shift how AI models are built, they are unlikely to eliminate the need for advanced hardware entirely. Nvidia’s diversified portfolio, which includes robotics and AI-driven applications, positions it well to weather these disruptions. For investors, the key question is whether DeepSeek’s innovations mark the beginning of a broader trend or a temporary market overreaction. If history is any guide, breakthroughs that lower costs often lead to expanded markets rather than shrinking them. Nvidia, as a leader in AI hardware, could still emerge as a major beneficiary in the long run. In the short term, the market may continue to grapple with the implications of DeepSeek’s rise. But with AI demand showing no signs of slowing, Nvidia’s upside could be far from over. At the time of writing Nvidia is recovering from an early week slump, with some upside pressure clearly evident on the daily chart. However, prices remaining below the moving average If a significant bounce materialises, buyers could face a hurdle at the $140.00 and $148.80 resistance levels. On the downside, sellers could find support at the $121.80 price level.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas bought more Nvidia shares amid the market sell-off following the rise of the Chinese AI app DeepSeek. In a post on the social media platform X, Srinivas said, “I just bought some more NVDA(sic).” Perplexity CEO made this claim while responding to a post on X, where Jim Cramer, a journalist from CNBC raised concerns over Nvidia shares. “There is no silver lining right now with Nvidia though,” Cramer wrote. The United States tech stocks and global stock markets were severely impacted by the low-cost Chinese AI app DeepSeek on Monday, tanking the value of leading chip maker Nvidia by $593 billion, a 17 per cent crash. January 27 marked a record one-day market-cap loss for the Wall Street stock in history, according to LSEG data. DeepSeek hit the Nvidia stocks the hardest, impacting others as well. On January 27, the US tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3.1 per cent, mainly due to Nvidia's crash, which lost a record 17 per cent overnight, followed by chip maker Broadcom Inc, which went down 17.4 per cent, ChatGPT backer Microsoft down nearly 2.1 per cent, and Google's parent company Alphabet dipped 4.2 per cent, according to a Reuters report. DeepSeek's latest large language models have challenged the dominance of top AI companies by offering similar performance to Meta or OpenAI with reportedly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's free app has also taken over ChatGPT on Apple's App Store in several regions, including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, and Singapore, impacting tech stocks. Several social media users have reacted to the X post of Srinivas with most of them appreciating his move. One of the users wrote, “You are the silver lining.” “Good move,” added another. “I never believe what my TV says about stocks. I believe myself. And I believe NVDA will go up again. I hold and not selling. Americans need NVDA and don’t care what China does,” another user said. “I mean, that's fair. if there's no silver lining, might as well buy the dip,” one of the users commented. “To the moon,” added another.

Title: How Freaked Out Should We Really Be About Communist China’s New AI Model?

DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence startup that sent tech stocks reeling this week, sparked fresh concerns about U.S. companies losing their competitive edge in the global race for AI dominance. While DeepSeek claims to have built its R1 model with less than $6 million and limited computing power, some industry analysts say this development poses little threat to America’s AI leadership, with one even suggesting the technology might backfire against Chinese authorities as unwieldy AI could fuel information freedom and social dissent. The Chinese company’s approach, though efficient, comes as U.S. firms push ahead with more ambitious projects and infrastructure investments. “If DeepSeek is as important as all of the papers say it is — and I think that there’s good reason to believe all of this — it makes OpenAI’s projects all the more valuable and all the more feasible in a shorter time period,” Will Rinehart, a senior technology researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. He also called the Chinese startup “the most important firm in AI right now” in his Monday article. deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. — Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 DeepSeek’s new R1 model, he explained, reduces both the financial barriers to AI development and reliance on advanced semiconductors — a key focus of the CHIPS Act. The model achieves comparable performance with significantly fewer parameters, requiring less computational power while maintaining output quality. DeepSeek’s app has already cruised to the top spot on Apple’s App Store ranking, easily surpassing U.S. competitors like ChatGPT and Claude. The startup’s meteoric rise fueled investor doubts about Nvidia — whose hardware has long been considered essential for scaling advanced language models — and triggered a nearly 17% drop in the company’s stock by Monday’s market close. Silicon Valley titan Marc Andreessen even hailed the model as “AI’s Sputnik moment” — but there’s reason to doubt that DeepSeek’s R1 represents another instance of a communist power beating the U.S. to a major technological milestone. Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment. — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) January 26, 2025 Rinehart commended DeepSeek for pioneering high-quality AI at minimal cost compared to high-budget U.S. firms, but he doesn’t believe the Chinese startup’s success necessarily spells the downfall of U.S. firms like OpenAI. He explained that, because of its open-source structure, DeepSeek’s R1 offers OpenAI a kind of “playbook” with which it can learn to streamline its own models — opening the door for a symbiotic relationship between the two firms. “What that means is, everyone else can look and see this white paper … and if you know what you’re looking at, you’re like, ‘OK, that’s what they’re doing.’ And so then you can basically avoid research dead ends and generally know which direction for the research to pursue,” Rinehart continued. “But as soon as that happens, that means that other relatively frontier labs can do the same thing.” The “white paper” Rinehart referenced is a document articulating a new language model feature and its applications for AI industry professionals, rather than consumers. Although Rinehart believes that classifying software as simply “open-source” or “closed-source” is overly simplistic for today’s language models, they are still somewhat useful designations: an open-source model like DeepSeek’s is traditionally understood as software that is publicly available for anyone to use, modify or share, which promotes collaboration. A closed-source model like OpenAI’s is understood as one whose code is kept proprietary, limiting access to its underlying systems to authorized employees. He also dismissed the notion that DeepSeek’s model is cost-efficient enough to eliminate OpenAI’s need for Stargate — the president’s $100 billion AI data center infrastructure initiative spearheaded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son — to develop its “next-generation” of data centers to supply computing power for a much higher “projected usage” than currently demanded of DeepSeek. (RELATED: Our Enemies Could Be Plotting To Use Trump’s Ambitious Agenda Against Us) Trump officially unveils “Stargate,” a $500B AI infrastructure initiative led by $MSFT OpenAI, SoftBank $ARM, $NVDA & $ORCL — creating 100,000 jobs & advancing U.S. AI dominance under SoftBank chair Masayoshi Son with OpenAI managing operations.pic.twitter.com/pgVMPBCKBo — Shay Boloor (@StockSavvyShay) January 21, 2025 “My sense is that this is going to continue regardless,” Rinehart said. “OpenAI is looking to basically create the next generation of data centers, and it seems like they’re going to do that regardless … what this new DeepSeek model suggests is that basically all of [OpenAI’s] efforts are potentially boosted at a much cheaper rate, right?” “This shortens my timeline for AGI — for artificial general intelligence, which is what they’re specifically seeking … I mean, gotta give it to Trump, right? He announced one of the most major, important investments in data centers ever. And I think that’s still a win,” he added. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) represents a key goal for the AI industry: an artificial intelligence system capable of matching or exceeding human-level performance across all cognitive or intellectual tasks — though AGI’s precise definition remains a subject of technical and philosophical debate. Dan Schneider, a policy expert and vice president at the Media Research Center, a nonprofit watchdog group, seemed unfazed by the stock market’s reaction to the DeepSeek release in an interview with the DCNF. Nvidia, a longtime favorite among investors, lost nearly $600 billion in market value Monday, the largest single-day decline for any U.S. company in history. “Nvidia’s stock prices had been soaring when people thought that it was a critical incumbent,” Schneider said. “OK, well, this is what happens in a free market system, where a new competitor enters the field and the incumbents then lose value. Wall Street should be optimistic about the value being created for all other businesses and people around the world. Whether you’re in agribusiness, or you’re in banking or you’re making widgets — AI is going to help create more value. This is going to be a great boon to the whole world economy.” Schneider seemed similarly unconcerned about the Chinese company’s growing competitive edge against U.S. firms, arguing that DeepSeek poses less threat to American interests than to the Chinese Communist Party itself. He predicted the technology would eventually spark social upheaval in China, citing his belief that open-source “AI has a real opportunity to end all types of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes” through the free exchange of information. Deep seek interesting prompt.. From Reddit pic.twitter.com/XGqYkTLLlM — Rohan Paul (@rohanpaul_ai) January 26, 2025 “Ultimately, it’s consumers who are going to really benefit. I really believe that AI is going to be key to defeating all sorts of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes,” Schneider said, also acknowledging the Chinese Communist Party will likely “use any kind of technology at its disposal to create weapons” for “nefarious purposes.” The Stargate Project has already begun preliminary construction for its first data center campus in Texas, according to OpenAI.

Amazon’s communications department is reportedly the latest segment of the company’s corporate workforce to see layoffs. The company is laying off dozens of people in the department, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). “Following a recent review, we’re making some changes to the Communications & Corporate Responsibility organization to help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers,” Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in the report. “As part of these changes, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.” Tens of thousands of corporate jobs have been cut at the company since Andy Jassy became CEO of Amazon in 2021, according to the report. These included 27,000 positions eliminated in corporate job cuts that began in 2022, as well as smaller numbers of layoffs in a series of smaller rounds focused on particular departments and roles, per the report. Jassy said in September that Amazon planned to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations as part of an effort to “operate like the world’s largest startup.” In a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online at the time, Jassy wrote that Amazon aimed to flatten organizations by asking each of its S-teams, or senior leadership teams, to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. “If we do this well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organization’s ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote at the time. It was reported Jan. 15 that tech giants Meta and Microsoft were cutting back on their headcounts, with Meta set to cut its workforce by 5% and Microsoft planning to pause hiring in part of its consulting business and lay off some employees. According to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker that monitors job cuts in the tech sector, 545 tech companies laid off a total of 152,664 employees in 2024. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Earlier this week, an obscure Chinese A.I. startup named DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley after it claimed that it had built a highly capable A.I. model called R1 for a fraction of the cost of its American rivals like OpenAI’s GPT and Google’s Gemini. Major A.I. stocks plummeted in response to the report. Nvidia (NVDA), which makes expensive chips (GPUs) that power the development of such A.I. models, saw its shares slide more than 16 percent on Monday (Jan. 27), erasing nearly $500 billion in its market cap.

You can opt out anytime. Despite the negative financial impact, Nvidia praised DeepSeek’s breakthrough. “DeepSeek is an excellent A.I. advancement and a perfect example of test time scaling,” a company spokesperson told Observer in a statement. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” Test-time scaling is a new real-time prediction technique that adjusts an A.I. model’s computational requirements based on the complexity of a task during real-time use. Before that, there were two dominant approaches to scaling an A.I. model: pre-training and post-training. Pre-training scaling expands an A.I. model’s dataset and computing power during initial training while post-training scaling helps fine-tune the model and enhance its real-world performance. According to its research paper, DeepSeek’s R1 model was trained on 2,048 Nvidia H800 chips for a total cost of under $6 million. Some companies and A.I. insiders are skeptical about this claim. For example, Alexandr Wang, the founder and CEO of Scale AI, suspects that DeepSeek may have more Nvidia chips than it’s letting on. Despite leveraging scaling laws, A.I. models often demand significant GPU power during output generation. To counter this, Deepseek said it developed R1 as a “distilled A.I.” model—a smaller model trained to replicate the behavior of larger A.I. systems. Distilled models consume less computational power and memory and offer greater accuracy in tasks such as reasoning and coding, making them an efficient solution for resource-constrained devices such as smartphones. Microsoft and OpenAI are currently investigating whether DeepSeek stole OpenAI’s proprietary data through GPT APIs using “distillation” techniques to build R1’s architecture. “It’s important to note that the $6 million figure for R1 doesn’t account for the prior resources invested,” Itamar Friedman, the former director of machine vision at Alibaba, told Observer. “DeepSeek’s relatively low training cost figure likely represents just the final training step.” Friedman explained that while scaling and optimization are valuable, there are limits to how small an A.I. model or training process can be while still effectively simulating thinking and learning. “Large, high-cost systems will still have a major advantage,” he said. DeepSeek, headquartered in Hangzhou, was founded in 2023 as a spinoff from the hedge fund High-Flyer, led by Liang Wenfeng. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Says Stock Market Correction an Overreaction to DeepSeek, Sees Opportunities Flashing

Fundstrat chief investment officer Tom Lee says the market sell-off triggered by the release of low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model DeepSeek is an overreaction. In a new interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell,” Lee says that Monday’s market correction is likely an opportunity for long-term investors. Stocks and crypto plummeted on Monday as investors processed DeepSeek’s implications, including for AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), one of the hardest hit stocks. “Markets don’t like uncertainty. They like visibility. They like moats. So markets are a little scared [Monday]. To me, it’s an overreaction. The Nvidia decline is the worst since March 2020, and we know that that ended up being a huge opportunity for investors. It’s not a fun day, but I’d be looking at this as an opportunity… This is the nature of technology. I’d be personally surprised if Nvidia became Betamax in the past week. I mean that really would be the kind of change that would be required to really justify selling Nvidia here. Given the need for AI because of global labor shortage and Nvidia chip dominance is still strong, unless a new model emerges that doesn’t require GPUs (graphics processing units) entirely, I’d say that markets just generally do buyer-ready aim.” Lee also says that he is bullish on the financial sector overall in 2025. “Financials, to me, represent a pretty good fundamental case of change this year, because we have a new administration, a Fed that is dovish, yields that aren’t painful for banks, and at a time when it could lead to upside for capital markets activity and multiples are low. So I think financials remain our number one S&P sector idea.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

In a note to staffers viewed by CNBC, Drew Herdener, who oversees public relations and corporate responsibility, wrote that the company is eliminating some jobs in those groups as part of a wider review into the "current org design" of the divisions. "As we examined our current org design and decided on the shifts outlined above, we identified some roles that were too narrowly scoped or that introduced unnecessary layers, where we couldn't solve the challenge by flattening the structure or shifting workloads," Herdener wrote. "To address this and do the right thing for the business, we're eliminating a small number of roles in Communications and Sustainability. This is a difficult decision to make and one that my leadership team and I do not take lightly." Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser confirmed the layoffs and said in a statement that the job cuts would "help us move faster, increase ownership, strengthen our culture, and bring teams closer to customers." Bloomberg earlier reported the job cuts. Herdener went on to say that the company may rehire some employees for roles at lower levels, "and in others, we will redistribute the headcount to other areas within the org." Amazon will provide financial support, continued benefits and job-placement assistance to laid-off staffers, Herdener said. Amazon cut more than 27,000 jobs across the company in 2022 and 2023 as part of CEO Andy Jassy's efforts to rein in costs. It had smaller rounds of job cuts in 2024 that are stretching into this year. The company has also continued to wind down some of its more experimental or unprofitable initiatives, including a "Try Before You Buy" clothing service and a speedy brick-and-mortar delivery program. Herdener said Amazon is streamlining its communications and sustainability divisions after the organization "grew quite a bit" in recent years. Herdener's role expanded in recent years and he now also oversees corporate responsibility, which includes the sustainability group. Amazon went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, adding staffers to its corporate workforce and in its hundreds of warehouses across the U.S. Its global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company had more than 1.5 million employees as of the end of the third quarter. Amazon is also making some changes to its "hub strategy," which dictates the offices teams primarily use, as part of the reorganization, Herdener said. The goal is to have "more team members working in the same physical location as the majority of their teammates and/or manager," he wrote. Herdener said he is leaving it up to his direct reports to decide which locations make sense for their teams. Earlier this month, Amazon began requiring corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office. In a push to get employees back to the office, some staffers were told to relocate to hubs in different states. Several Amazon employees told CNBC following the announcement of the "return to hub" policy that they had chosen to leave the company instead of relocating. As part of the five-day office mandate, Amazon also set a goal to flatten its corporate structure by having fewer managers in each organization. Amazon has made sustainability a bigger directive within the company. It set ambitious climate goals in 2019, including a commitment to being carbon neutral by 2040. It also aims to power its business operations with renewable energy sources by 2025, and has amassed a portfolio of more than 500 wind and solar projects globally.

The Nasdaq and other major indices declined following the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, with the tech-heavy index falling 1.1% by the afternoon as investors digested the central bank’s cautious stance on interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee kept the overnight borrowing rate unchanged in the 4.25% to 4.50% range and signaled continued caution about potential rate cuts, with recent economic indicators showing mixed signals. “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the FOMC said in a statement. “The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level, and labor market conditions remain solid.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 dropped by 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Nvidia (NVDA-2.79%), a key player in the AI sector, continued to decline, falling by 6% Wednesday following a massive selloff triggered by DeepSeek. Other AI stocks, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.61%), Micron (MU-0.70%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM-3.38%), also saw losses. Investors are now closely monitoring the earnings reports from Tesla (TSLA-6.07%), Meta (META+2.03%), and Microsoft (MSFT-0.16%), which are due after the market’s close. Shares of coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX+0.19%) jumped over 8% following its earning reports. The Starbucks ceramic mug hype is real – so much so that CEO Brian Niccol mentioned it three times during the company’s Jan. 28 earnings call. The return of the coffeehouse classic is part of Niccol’s broader “Back to Starbucks” strategy, which aims to reestablish the company as a premium coffee brand. This move comes as the company grapples with a slight sales decline, though it exceeded Wall Street’s revenue expectations. “We reintroduced ceramic mugs and handwritten notes on cups to better connect with customers and elevate the cafe experience for those who choose to stay and work,” Niccol said during the earnings call. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT-3.64%) (DJT) shares surged over 7% Wednesday after announcing plans to expand into financial services, including potential investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The company, majority-owned by President Donald Trump, unveiled a new fintech brand, Truth.Fi, which will launch with up to $250 million. These funds, custodied with brokerage firm Charles Schwab (SCHW+0.24%), will be allocated across customized exchange-traded funds, cryptocurrencies, and other investment vehicles. — Francisco Velasquez contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.9% in the afternoon session after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is considering curbing sales of the company's chips to China following the emergence of the DeepSeek AI model. According to the sources, the restriction might apply to some of Nvidia's cutting-edge chips, including the H20 AI chips. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Nvidia’s shares are very volatile and have had 26 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 13% on the news that stocks heavily tied to the AI market took a hit after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released a new large language model (DeepSeek-R1) that ranks competitively on key global benchmarks (coding competitions, math evaluations), uses less advanced semiconductor chips, costs significantly less to build (at $5.5 million - excluding non-compute costs), and has already achieved strong adoption after topping the iPhone App Store for AI apps. Notably, the company has also open-sourced this model, a move that may make it harder for rivals to justify huge upfront expenditures on hardware, software, and expertise to develop similar systems. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella praised DeepSeek's efforts, calling the new model "super impressive" for its open-source design, efficient inference-time computing, and high compute efficiency. "We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously," he added. Nadella's comments suggest that upstarts like DeepSeek could reshape the competitive landscape of AI. DeepSeek's announcement disrupts long-held assumptions in key ways: 1) It undercuts the narrative that bigger budgets and access to top-tier chips are the only ways forward for AI development. 2) By using less advanced hardware, DeepSeek opens the door for innovators who face high chip costs or export restrictions, reaffirming they can still compete. 3.) The model's success questions the growth narrative of chipmakers like Nvidia—whose soaring valuations depend on the demand for cutting-edge, high-performance hardware. Overall, DeepSeek's model demonstrates that AI innovation is no longer a race fueled solely by how much you spend, but rather by how resourceful you can be with what you have. Nvidia is down 12.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $121.52 per share, it is trading 18.7% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,796. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 6% in intraday trading Wednesday, dashing hopes for a quick recovery from losses earlier in the week amid concerns about competitiveness of American AI firms and their spending on the emerging technology. The AI chipmaker's stock led losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and was among the top decliners on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Wednesday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), Palantir (PLTR), and several other AI darlings over the past year also were lower. The surging popularity of an app from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which runs on an AI model it claimed can perform on par with American rivals at a fraction of the cost, had sent Nvidia and a slew of other U.S. tech stocks into a tailspin Monday. Despite a brief rebound in Tuesday's session, the tech sector fell back into the red Wednesday as Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) rolled out a new AI model it says can outperform models from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms (META). The rapid rise of lower-cost models from Chinese companies that can compete with those from leading American firms has spurred a reckoning on Wall Street, with earnings from Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) likely to be in the spotlight later tonight as both firms face pressure to prove their AI investments can yield results that justify the costs. Analysts have so far remained mostly bullish on their prospects, with Morgan Stanley analysts telling clients that advances by DeekSeek could prove "positive" for Microsoft and Meta, suggesting Meta could implement them and that Microsoft's Azure platform would benefit from a proliferation of AI models and consumer applications. Bank of America analysts told clients in a note Wednesday they see this as "AI's Sputnik moment," suggesting competition could push U.S. hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom, and other AI chipmakers. They reiterated a "buy" rating and $190 price target for Nvidia's stock, adding they "view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) will report its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, its first such announcement since the company ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger over frustrations with his enormous turnaround effort. Intel is currently being led by co-CEOs David Zinsner, who also serves as CFO, and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, who is also CEO of Intel Products. The company is still searching for a permanent CEO to take the reins and attempt to revitalize the storied chipmaker. Intel stock is down a staggering 54% over the last 12 months and reported the largest quarterly loss in its history last quarter. Intel isn’t the only chipmaker hurting, though. Rival AMD (AMD) is down 36% throughout the last year. Nvidia (NVDA), however, continues to gain steam, rising 93% in the last year, despite suffering a massive rout on Monday on the back of worries related to China’s DeepSeek AI. Intel’s still-nascent foundry business, which both produces chips for Intel and is designed to act as a contract manufacturer for third parties, continues to be a drag on its overall revenue despite announcing agreements to build chips for Amazon’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT). Intel is expected to report earnings per share of $0.12 on revenue of $13.8 billion in the quarter, according to Bloomberg consensus data. That’s a drop from the $0.54 per share and $15.4 billion in revenue the company reported in Q4 last year. Intel’s Client Computing business, which includes chips for PCs, is set to top out at $7.8 billion, down from $8.8 billion last year, while its data center business is expected to reach $3.3 billion, down from $3.9 billion last year. The Intel Foundry business is expected to hit $4.5 billion, up from $291 million in Q4 2023. Intel is working to build out new facilities to research and construct chips across the US, but the company is dealing with a relatively flat PC market despite promises that AI PCs would help buoy the space in 2024. According to IDC, PC shipments rose just 1% in 2024, and there’s still plenty of uncertainty about 2025. “The overall macroeconomic concerns seem to be overshadowing some of the progress and excitement around AI PCs,” Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC's Worldwide Device Trackers, said in a statement. “However, we maintain the view that the impact that on-device AI will have on the industry will be positive, even if the inflection point is delayed.” The company’s data center business is also struggling to catch up to the likes of Nvidia. While Intel is working to develop its own AI chips, it’s still far behind market leaders, and there’s no clear understanding as to if and when it could catch up.

Title: Should You Buy Nvidia Stock in the Wake of the DeepSeek Bombshell? Here's What Wall Street Is Saying.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/29/2025 9:43:48 AM PST by SeekAndFind Technology stocks were rocked to their core Monday after claims made by a Chinese start-up threatened to upend the existing artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm.There’s a compelling argument that recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) could have vast implications for the future. Over the past couple of years, advances in generative AI have helped fuel a roaring bull market with promises of significant productivity increases. The potential windfall of increased profits has companies racing to adopt these next-generation algorithms.One of the biggest beneficiaries of these secular tailwinds has been Nvidia (NVDA 8.93%). The company’s graphic processing units (GPUs), which were initially developed for gaming applications, proved equally adept at supplying the computational horsepower needed for AI. Robust sales of these processors fueled a parabolic rise, sending Nvidia stock up more than 500% over the past two years.However, claims made by Chinese start-up DeepSeek threatened to upset the existing paradigm, sending Nvidia into a tailspin. The stock slumped 17% and lost nearly $600 billion in market cap in a single day. Nevertheless, after a good night’s sleep, Wall Street has some thoughts on the matter.Perspective is requiredEdgar Allan Poe famously wrote, “Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.” Wall Street seems to be taking that approach, to a certain extent, regarding some of the assertions made by DeepSeek. Specifically, claims that it created its chatbot for $5.6 million are being met with skepticism by some analysts.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients (emphasis mine), “Did DeepSeek really ‘build OpenAI for $5M?’ Of course not.” The analyst suggested that many of the routine expenses and development costs were left out of the total. “DeepSeek’s R1 paper did not quantify the additional resources that were required to develop the R1 model (presumably they were substantial as well),” he wrote.Many investors panicked on Monday, fearing that more efficient AI models would mean less business for Nvidia, but that’s likely not the case. According to Jevons paradox, efficiency gains from technological advancements generally increase demand by bringing costs down. Put another way, lower-cost AI models will drive increased adoption, which will increase demand for Nvidia’s AI-centric processors.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse took a similar position: “Innovation is driving down cost of adoption and making AI ubiquitous,” he wrote. “We see this progress as positive in the need for more and more compute over time (not less).” This bodes well for Nvidia.Tigress Financial upgraded Nvidia to strong buy on Tuesday and increased its price target on the stock to a Street-high $220. That represents potential upside for investors of 71% compared to Tuesday’s closing price. The analyst believes that the data center growth needed to support AI will continue unabated and Nvidia — which controls a dominant share of the data center GPU market — will continue to profit from this trend.Even in the wake of the DeepSeek bombshell, Wall Street is almost universally behind Nvidia. Of the 63 analysts who have offered an opinion thus far in January, 94% rate it a buy or strong buy, and none recommend selling.This shows that Wall Street remains remarkably bullish on Nvidia despite DeepSeek’s seemingly earthshaking developments.The Motley Fool’s OpinionOn Jan. 27, a roundtable discussion among Fool analysts took place, and they debated the issues surrounding DeepSeek’s announcement. From that conversation, several highlights stand out:The panelists echoed the question of whether it cost just $5.6 million to train DeepSeek’s chatbot. A review of the white paper supplied by DeepSeek seems to suggest that this only includes the cost for the most recent version and none of the development that preceded it.The DeepSeek AI assistant recently became the No.1 downloaded free app on the Apple Store. However, there seems to be a discrepancy between the number of downloads and the actual app usage, which could call into question the veracity of these statistics.Those caveats aside, there’s the potential that this is the natural evolution of the technology. As resources become more scarce, the focus will inevitably turn toward innovation, breeding the next generation of advancements.Even if this represents a breakthrough in AI development, it likely won’t reduce the need for Nvidia’s state-of-the-art processors, as they will continue to play a crucial role in training AI models.The group generally agreed that Nvidia’s premium valuation would lead to increased volatility, which would test the mettle of investors.Collectively, the evidence suggests that DeepSeek’s bombshell was more of an inevitable evolution of technology than a major breakthrough.It’s still the early days of the AI revolution, and as such, investors should expect more “bombshell” developments in the field in the months and years to come. Some investors were scared out of Nvidia on Monday, but having a knee-jerk reaction to news like this could be a costly mistake.Data by YChartsFinally, Nvidia stock is currently selling for roughly 50 times earnings. While that might be enough to send value investors headed for the exits, that’s far below Nvidia’s average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 81 over the past five years, making it relatively inexpensive from a historical perspective. Furthermore, the stock gained more than 2,000% during that same period, which illustrates why it is worthy of a premium.Given the company’s long track record and history of innovation, I still believe Nvidia is a worthwhile investment.

Edgar Allan Poe famously wrote, “Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see.” Wall Street seems to be taking that approach, to a certain extent, regarding some of the assertions made by DeepSeek. Specifically, claims that it created its chatbot for $5.6 million are being met with skepticism by some analysts.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients (emphasis mine), “Did DeepSeek really ‘build OpenAI for $5M?’ Of course not.” The analyst suggested that many of the routine expenses and development costs were left out of the total. “DeepSeek’s R1 paper did not quantify the additional resources that were required to develop the R1 model (presumably they were substantial as well),” he wrote.Many investors panicked on Monday, fearing that more efficient AI models would mean less business for Nvidia, but that’s likely not the case. According to Jevons paradox, efficiency gains from technological advancements generally increase demand by bringing costs down. Put another way, lower-cost AI models will drive increased adoption, which will increase demand for Nvidia’s AI-centric processors.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse took a similar position: “Innovation is driving down cost of adoption and making AI ubiquitous,” he wrote. “We see this progress as positive in the need for more and more compute over time (not less).” This bodes well for Nvidia.Tigress Financial upgraded Nvidia to strong buy on Tuesday and increased its price target on the stock to a Street-high $220.

Given the company’s long track record and history of innovation, I still believe Nvidia is a worthwhile investment. Given Deep Six is based on pirated nvidia chips…… MSN Money: “There is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases, and that is Nvidia,” said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. Bernstein has reiterated its outperform ratings on Nvidia, with a $175 price target, and Broadcom, with a $220 target, saying it continues to like those names within the U.S. semiconductor sector.” CCP: Chinese Communist Party actually means Cut, Copy, Paste. My personal take... After the initial shake-out, more voices calling for temperance rose to the surface. While it is entirely possible that a more efficient model could lead to weakening demand for Nvidia’s chips, it is far from a guarantee. In fact, it could have the opposite effect: It could lead to increased demand. There is a concept in economics dubbed the Jevons Paradox that may apply here — that is, increased efficiency in a market leads to more demand, not less. If DeepSeek’s model leads to AI models in general taking a leap forward in efficiency, I believe that AI applications will become more useful and ubiquitous, and thus demand will increase. We will see how this pans out, but the initial panic has subsided, and today saw Nvidia’s stock recover somewhat. My personal take...

A fool and his money are some party... and the AI hawkers are partying all the way to their Cayman Island accounts. I suspect the Nvidia chips are too expensive and too power hungry for consumer use. They’re probably too capable for widespread military use. They’re great chips, but their market may not be as large as hoped for. Be aware, I’m not a great investor. My mom with an eighth-grade education was a great investor. “Technology stocks were rocked to their core” NVDA still up 100% in a year. 2,000% in five years. Qwen, also known as Tongyi Qianwen (通义千问), is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba. The latest version, Qwen 2.5, has been making headlines for its impressive performance. Alibaba claims that Qwen 2.5 outperforms other leading AI models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, DeepSeek’s V3, and Meta’s Llama 3.1. Copilot: Qwen Every country in the world is going to require millions of them for data centres that are currently being planned or under construction. The market for NVIDIA chips is going to be strong for a long time to come. “I suspect the Nvidia chips are too expensive and too power hungry for consumer use. They’re probably too capable for widespread military use.” Nvidia has consumer GPU chips. Here is a gaming PC for $849. https://www.bestbuy.com/site/cyberpowerpc-gamer-master-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-5-5500-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-8gb-1tb-ssd-black/6575120.p?skuId=6575120 Then there are their “AI” processors which are used to train AI programs. Go figure. ChiComms lied. Their spyware is a house of cards. Yes, I saw that too, thanks. The Tech Space is always crackling with energy, and much of it is reciprocal. More importantly... What did Nancy Pelosi do? New technology disrupts but that is how new growth curves are created. Sometimes disruptive technologies like AI get disrupted because that’s where the focus of innovation is. Some like Apple have often done to themselves because they are already thinking at least one generation ahead. The timing may be a surprise but as one who is long on NVDA. I will be interested in how they respond over the next few quarters. And Nvidia is more than a chip company. They are a software and network company. As an example, they have more software engineers than hardware. Their CUDA environment leads the AI deployment systems. It compiles a number of languages for AI use on their chips. Their purchase of Mellanox gave them the fast network technology for data centers. I bought NVDA Monday and yesterday. There’s nothing about DeepSeek that indicates the need for Nvidia’s GPUs is going to decline. And I don’t need the money short-term.

Title: Marketers Say They Are Ready To Move Beyond Google Search

Plus: UnitedMasters Brings Musicians Into The Creator Economy, CNN Layoffs Show Problems In Broadcasting, AI-Generated Media Dazzles And Baffles Search is changing and marketers say they’re ready for it. A new study from Botify found that 94% of marketing leaders say they are at least somewhat prepared to optimize brand visibility for AI search, with almost 42% saying they’re very prepared. Not only are they prepared, but they’re enthusiastic, too. Nearly two-thirds were excited by Gartner’s prediction that AI chatbots will cause a 25% drop in traditional search engine traffic by 2026, and 74% were excited by what they’ve seen so far with ChatGPT Search. While the study shows that marketers are welcoming the challenge of moving away from Google’s long dominance in basic online search, how they’re getting ready is different across the board. More than six in 10 said they’re adjusting their strategies, but what they’re adjusting for varies. The survey asked marketers what they think of when someone mentions non-Google search, and while OpenAI products got high marks—56% think of ChatGPT and 42% think of SearchGPT—many are thinking more along the lines of traditional social channels. YouTube was the most popular alternative, with just over two-thirds thinking of it, but Meta and TikTok were each considered by about 40% of respondents. (The study was conducted in December, before the TikTok ban-or-sale law was upheld or enacted.) Nearly 45% thought about e-commerce giant Amazon. While marketers have been working on their social media and e-commerce search strategies for years, there’s a steep learning curve in figuring out just what to do for generative AI marketing plans. Just over half—55%—say understanding how platforms work is a major challenge. About the same amount said they’re concerned about data privacy. And nearly half are worried about how to keep up with the pace of innovation. The good news for marketers is that there’s a lot in flux with generative AI search. Tools are being refined, algorithms are changing, systems are “learning” better answers, and different types of information are being prioritized. It’s a good time for marketers to experiment and try new things to see what works, especially since generative AI platforms are doing the same thing. And the fact that most marketers see this as an opportunity means that creative solutions are likely to come from all areas, with potential for unexpected and positive results. Technology has been changing the way things work for years. It’s had huge impacts on creators, democratizing the ability for people to create something, put it out into the world and have it make a difference. Legendary record industry executive Steve Stoute saw opportunities in technology, and harnessed its opportunity for the music industry by starting UnitedMasters in 2017. I talked to him about how UnitedMasters is augmenting the creator economy, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. The CNN logo outside its Atlanta studios. Another sign of the times for traditional broadcast media: Last week, CNN cut about 6% of its workforce—about 200 employees, mainly on the broadcast side—but continued hiring for digital media jobs. Forbes senior contributor David Bloom writes the cuts shouldn’t have been a surprise. CNN has been losing viewership as many people change the way they look for and consume news. Benzinga reports that since the election in November, CNN has lost 47% of its primetime viewers, hitting a 30-year ratings low for the network. When the cuts were announced, CNN CEO Mark Thompson said the network will soon launch a streaming service, revamp its digital footprint and subscriber services and make changes to its lineup—and the total headcount at the news organization should be about the same when all is done. Bloom writes that Thompson has been working for about a year to figure out how to remake CNN for today’s viewer. Many other legacy networks that have seen the same types of issues—especially MSNBC and ABC News—are likely to be paying close attention. An image from László Gaál's video. A new, “speculative” commercial featuring Porsche from digital artist László Gaál is attracting a lot of attention. It tells the story of the Italian Pisano family, which has long been known in their small village for having extremely flexible necks. The reason: A neighbor of their ancestral home who loves sports cars regularly drives the latest Porsche models past the Pisanos’ balcony. The detailed story, which includes a variety of locations, a large cast and innovative camera shots, isn’t the attention-grabbing part. The entire commercial—including the vast majority of the “How I made this” behind-the-scenes interview with Gaál at the end—was AI-generated, writes Forbes contributor Roger Dooley. Gaál used Veo2 from Google DeepMind, which is still in experimental mode, to create everything except the scenes when he personally is on camera, spinning a tale of the locations, cast and crew needed for the commercial. Unlike the somewhat clunky and not-always-logical AI-generated Coca-Cola holiday commercials last year, this commercial is widely praised for its realistic feel. On a Reddit thread, Gaál said the entire commercial took about three weeks to make. The video has several disclaimers throughout that indicate it was made almost entirely by AI (and was also not actually created in conjunction with Porsche). But more obscure, low tech AI creations—known as AI slop—are increasingly proliferating on social media, often without anything to tell viewers that the images aren’t real. On Facebook, some users post over-the-top AI-generated images, sometimes daring people to believe them. They’re widely believed and accepted as real. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg “loved” a viral AI-generated photo last week of a baker who created an intricate loaf of challah bread shaped like an actual-size horse, Forbes senior contributor Dani Di Placido writes. The photo was originally posted on a Polish satire site, and has been widely shared to show the baker’s “feat”—despite the fact that designing and baking a complex loaf of bread that size that looks so good is a nearly impossible task. And Di Placido writes Zuckerberg’s reaction could just be recognizing a well-made AI-generated image. The header photo on the centibillionaire’s own Facebook page is an AI-generated one of llamas standing on and around computer servers. UnitedMasters founder and CEO Steve Stoute, and the "UnitedMasters: A Celebration Of Independence" event at the 65th Grammy Awards. With a career in the music business that started in the 1990s, Steve Stoute has long been a key leader in the space. He served as an executive at Sony Music and Interscope Geffen A&M, then started advertising agency Translation. In 2017, he started UnitedMasters, a technology-driven company that lets artists develop music, get licensing and promotion and reach brand partnerships without going through the traditional record label process. UnitedMasters is valued at $550 million, and its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet and 20th Century Fox. I talked to Stoute about why his business model—and the creator economy as a whole—is thriving. This conversation contains expletives, and has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. 2024 was an incredible year for UnitedMasters, especially with UnitedMasters artist FloyyMenor having the global No. 1 song on TikTok, “Gata Only.” What did you see proven with your business model last year? Stoute: When we first did this, I knew that [it would help] the mid-to-long tail artists, who probably would’ve never gotten a record deal because they couldn’t get to New York or LA, to the cities where record deals were given out, or because they took longer to develop. They would not necessarily get a deal. If we were able to give them a home, they would be able to earn a living by doing what they love. It’s being able to earn a living with doing something you love. That, I think, [is] what makes the world a better place, so that’s what I was focused on. All of a sudden, it wasn’t just for the mid-to-long tail. The big frontline artists wanted independence. They wanted to own their masses. They wanted to get the economics in their favor. And with FloyyMenor from Chile, he didn't have to go to Miami or LA or New York to get a record deal. He uploaded the song from his home and had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year, the No. 6 Spotify song of the year, a top 10 Apple Music song of the year. What that means is we’re happy. That’s another artist who got a chance to maximize their economics because of our platform. No. 2, what it shows is that the metric that the big guys use to justify success, we’re doing that too. We weren’t ever in the game that had the No. 1 TikTok song of the year. We were here to give people a platform and allow them the opportunity to do what they love and earn a living. It’s like if somebody's writing on Substack and then they’re the No. 1 published author in the New York Times. They didn’t build Substack for that. They built it for people to make a living. But if it hits that metric, then all of a sudden Penguin and all the big guys go, wait a minute. They’re playing in my game. How does the creator economy play into your business? I felt like musicians were left out of the creator economy because everyone thought the labels were handling that. The creator economy was really focused on gamers and makeup bloggers and vloggers and things like that. The music people had this thing called a record company. So that was that. The artists that did not have record deals were like: We are part of the creator economy. I think SoundCloud benefited from that. Early on, SoundCloud harbored the creator economy musicians, and then they wanted more. They didn’t want to just be on SoundCloud. They wanted distribution and opportunities. When I built UnitedMasters, I was building it not only to provide artist distribution, but we had Translation. We worked with the NBA and State Farm and AT&T and Meta, to name a few. We can not only distribute these artists, but we can do deals for them with some of these brands. The combination of being able to go to one place and get your music distributed, plus have access to brands for larger opportunities was the ecosystem I thought and I know, and is proving to be what a music company should look like going forward. From what you see, what is in store for 2025 for the creator economy as a whole? Outside of live sports, that’s where brands want to put their money. You have NFL, NBA, hockey, WNBA, and then you have the creator economy. You have podcasters and bloggers and streamers and musicians, and you’re like, how can I ring-fence that so I could measure the results within that infrastructure, and how can I protect brand safety in doing that? Brands are saying, I’m all-in for that. What the creator economy has to do is get brand ready: My shit’s together, it’s brand-friendly, it’s measurable. You can rely on us. Now you’re talking about a new medium that has money rushing towards it, that they didn’t expect to happen so fast so soon. They have to get leveled up. Major League Baseball reported it hit record revenues in 2024, with the largest one-season growth since 2015. $12.1 billion: Last year’s revenues, according to the league $1.9 billion: League and club sponsorships in 2024 ‘We’ve had a good year. Our business was strong’: MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told Sportico in October, during the World Series While Bud Light’s now-infamous partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney caused fallout for the brand, not all of it was because conservative consumers were offended. The actual strategy was lacking, writes Forbes contributor Gillian Oakenfull. Here’s how to build a strategy for inclusivity campaigns so they won’t be seen as symbolic gestures, especially if they push the envelope. Storytelling is an important component of marketing, but it’s also a tool for leadership. Here are some ways to use storytelling to better connect with your team, build trust, and inspire ideas.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Alibaba releases AI model to challenge DeepSeek days after market sell-off
URL: https://qz.com/alibaba-qwen-ai-model-deepseek-r1-v3-meta-llama-china-1851750340
Time Published: 2025-01-29T15:52:00Z
Full Content:
Days after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a global tech stock sell-off, a homegrown rival said its new AI model performed even better. Alibaba Cloud (BABA-0.03%) released an upgraded version of its flagship AI model, Qwen2.5-Max, that performed better than top open-source competitors, including DeepSeek’s V3 model and Meta’s (META+2.03%) Llama 3.1 model on various benchmarks, according to results published by the firm on WeChat. The cloud computing subsidiary of Alibaba Group also found its Qwen2.5-Max showed comparable performance to OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet — both closed-source models. The Chinese firm said its AI model “has demonstrated world-leading model performance in mainstream authoritative benchmarks,” including the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), which evaluates general knowledge, and LiveCodeBench, which tests coding skills. The Qwen2.5-Max announcement follows DeepSeek’s launch of its first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, last week, which demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models, O1-mini and O1, on several industry benchmarks, according to its technical paper. The release of DeepSeek-R1 prompted Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P 500 futures to fall Monday morning. Nvidia’s (NVDA-2.79%) shares plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. Investors were spooked by the DeepSeek-R1 launch, which comes after the December release of DeepSeek-V3. While Alibaba Cloud hasn’t disclosed its development costs, DeepSeek’s claim that it built its model for just $5.6 million using Nvidia’s reduced-capability graphics processing units has caught the market’s attention, challenging assumptions about the massive investments needed for AI development. According to the technical paper, DeepSeek used a cluster of just under 2,050 Nvidia H800 chips for training its V3 model — a less powerful version of the chipmaker’s H100 that it is allowed to sell to Chinese firms under U.S. chip restrictions. The cluster is also much smaller than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. DeepSeek’s release has called Big Tech’s tens of billions in spending on AI into question ahead of a slate of earnings results, as well as the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to curb advanced chips from entering the country.

Title: The paradox at the heart of the AI debate

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/29/2025 7:50:24 AM PST by Red Badger Investors in energy stocks panicked this week over the release of a new, cheaper AI model, ignoring an argument that reducing the energy needs of such models could actually increase demand for energy overall. Why it matters: The news could end up being bullish for those stocks, which lost more than $40 billion in value on Monday. How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

How it works: The Jevons Paradox, as first formulated in 1865 by English economist William Stanley Jevons, states that greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource. His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

His example was coal: After the Watt steam engine was introduced — which burned much less coal than its predecessors — demand for coal rose substantially, as Watt's engines were built into a wide range of applications. What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

What they're saying: "This positive supply shock will massively increase demand for AI compute and applications of all sorts," says Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University. Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying "there are multiple indications" the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications. Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

Between the lines: The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space. It's worth noting that DeepSeek was developed by a Chinese hedge fund, rather than by a dedicated AI company or university department. Cheaper AI might also mean AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products. Driving the news: Notwithstanding the knee-jerk investor panic, Chevron and GE Vernova said Tuesday they are building new power plants co-located next to data centers. The plants will generate enough electricity to power 3 million homes, but won't even be connected to the grid. The data centers will use every watt they produce 24/7. The bottom line: Between electric vehicles and the seemingly bottomless thirst from data centers for electricity, don't hold your breath waiting for demand to fall.

So many people cannot see beyond the tips of their own noses when thinking about technical innovation. It’s weird because most everybody on FR lived through the computer and electronic communications revolution. Think back to where computers and communications were in 1970 or 1980. I played a lot of games with my son like that when he was growing up. We would think about what the world was like when his great grand parents lived and what they witnessed. Then the same for his grandparents and for his own mom & dad. My own great grandfather was an entrepreneur in battery energy storage around 1900. He owned factories manufacturing batteries for urban rail transport, boat transport and communications and became quite wealthy. Those games with my son gave him a good sense of the grand scope of technical innovation, its introduction, and how it impacted peoples’ lives. I’m reading a book right now about the history of short-line railroads in the West. There were few people in California in 1849. By 1852, a state census found 200,000 people in California. Plans for railroads started being put into action in 1853 and short line construction started in 1854. Then the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, only 15 years later! Could those people in 1854 even conceive of a transcontinental railroad connecting California to the east? Probably not. 20 posted on 01/29/2025 9:04:07 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (They were the FA-est of times, they were the FO-est of times.)

Title: DeepSeek: Lemon, It’s Wednesday

Time Published: 2025-01-29T15:00:09Z
Full Content:
It’s been another *checks notes* two days, so it’s time for all the latest DeepSeek news. You can also see my previous coverage of the r1 model and, from Monday various reactions including the Panic at the App Store. Before we get to new developments, I especially want to reiterate and emphasize the need to calm down about that $5.5 million ‘cost of training’ for v3. I wouldn’t quite agree with Palmer Lucky that ‘the $5m number is bogus’ and I wouldn’t call it a ‘Chinese psyop’ because I think we mostly did this to ourselves but it is very often being used in a highly bogus way – equating the direct compute cost of training v3 with the all-in cost of creating r1. Which is a very different number. DeepSeek is cracked, they cooked, and r1 is super impressive, but the $5.5 million v3 training cost: Altman handled his response to r1 with grace. OpenAI plans to ‘pull up some new releases.’ Meaning, oh, you want to race? I suppose I’ll go faster and take less precautions. Sam Altman: deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. but mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. the world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond. It is very Galaxy Brain to say ‘this is perhaps good for OpenAI’ and presumably it very much is, but here’s a scenario. Ethan Mollick: DeepSeek is a really good model, but it is not generally a better model than o1 or Claude. But since it is both free & getting a ton of attention, I think a lot of people who were using free “mini” models are being exposed to what a early 2025 reasoner AI can do & are surprised I’m not saying that’s the baseline scenario, but I do expect the world to be quite amazed at the next generation of models, and they could now be more primed for that. Mark Chen (Chief Research Officer, OpenAI): Congrats to DeepSeek on producing an o1-level reasoning model! Their research paper demonstrates that they’ve independently found some of the core ideas that we did on our way to o1. However, I think the external response has been somewhat overblown, especially in narratives around cost. One implication of having two paradigms (pre-training and reasoning) is that we can optimize for a capability over two axes instead of one, which leads to lower costs. But it also means we have two axes along which we can scale, and we intend to push compute aggressively into both! As research in distillation matures, we’re also seeing that pushing on cost and pushing on capabilities are increasingly decoupled. The ability to serve at lower cost (especially at higher latency) doesn’t imply the ability to produce better capabilities. We will continue to improve our ability to serve models at lower cost, but we remain optimistic in our research roadmap, and will remain focused in executing on it. We’re excited to ship better models to you this quarter and over the year! Given the costs involved, and that you can scale to get better outputs, ‘serve faster and cheaper’ and ‘get better answers’ seem pretty linked, or are going to look rather similar. There is still a real and important difference between ‘I spend 10x as much compute to get 10x as many tokens to think with’ versus ‘I taught the model how to do longer CoT’ versus ‘I made the model smarter.’ Or at least I think there is. Should we now abandon all our plans to build gigantic data centers because DeepSeek showed we can run AI cheaper? No. Of course not. We’ll need more. Jevons Paradox and all that. Another question is compute governance. Does DeepSeek’s model prove that there’s no point in using compute thresholds for frontier model governance? My answer is no. DeepSeek did not mean the scaling laws stopped working. DeepSeek found new ways to scale and economize, and also to distill. But doing the same thing with more compute would have gotten better results, and indeed more compute is getting other labs better results if you don’t control for compute costs, and also they will now get to use these innovations themselves. Karen Hao: Much of the coverage has focused on U.S.-China tech competition. That misses a bigger story: DeepSeek has demonstrated that scaling up AI models relentlessly, a paradigm OpenAI introduced and champions, is not the only, and far from the best, way to develop AI. Yoavgo: This is trending in my feed, but I don’t get it. DeepSeek did not show that scale is not the way to go for AI (their base model is among the largest in parameter counts; their training data is huge, at 13 trillion tokens). They just scaled more efficiently. Thus far OpenAI & its peer scaling labs have sought to convince the public & policymakers that scaling is the best way to reach so-called AGI. This has always been more of an argument based in business than in science. Jon Stokes: Holy wow what do words even mean. What R1 does is a new type of scaling. It’s also GPU-intensive. In fact, the big mystery today in AI world is why NVIDIA dropped despite R1 demonstrating that GPUs are even more valuable than we thought they were. No part of this is coherent. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): The real takeaway from DeepSeek is that with reasoning models you can achieve great performance with a small amount of compute. Now imagine what you can do with a large amount of compute. Noam Brown (OpenAI): Algorithmic breakthroughs and scaling are complementary, not in competition. The former bends the performance vs compute curve, while the latter moves further along the curve. Benjamin Todd: Deepseek hasn’t shown scaling doesn’t work. Take Deepseek’s techniques, apply 10x the compute, and you’ll get much better performance. And compute efficiency has always been part of the scaling paradigm. Ethan Mollick: The most unnerving part of the DeepSeek reaction online has been seeing folks take it as a sign that AI capability growth is not real. It signals the opposite, large improvements are possible, and is almost certain to kick off an acceleration in AI development through competition. I know a lot of people want AI to go away, but I am seeing so many interpretations of DeepSeek in ways that don’t really make sense, or misrepresent what they did. Dealing with the implications of AI, and trying to steer it towards positive use, is now more urgent, not less. Andrew Rettek: Deepseek means OPENAI just increased their effective compute by more than an OOM. OpenAI and Anthropic (in the forms of CEOs Sam Altman and Dario Amodei) have both expressed agreement on that since the release of r1, saying that they still believe the future involves very large and expensive training runs, including large amounts of compute on the RL step. David Sacks agreed as well, so the administration knows. One can think of all this as combining multiple distinct scaling laws. Mark Chen above talked about two axes but one could refer to at least four? Also you can extend to new modalities and use cases and so on. So essentially: Buckle up. Speaking of buckling up, nothing to see here, just a claimed 2x speed boost to r1, written by r1. Of course, that’s very different from r1 coming up with the idea. Aiden McLaughlin: switching to reasoners is like taking a sharp turn on a racetrack. everyone brakes to take the turn; for a moment, all cars look neck-and-neck when exiting the turn, small first-mover advantages compound. and ofc, some cars have enormous engines that eat up straight roads Dean Ball: I recommend trying not to overindex on the industry dynamics you’re observing now in light of the deepseek plot twist, or indeed of any particular plot twist. It’s a long game, and we’re riding a world-historical exponential. Things will change a lot, fast, again and again. It’s not that Jan is wrong, I’d be a lot more interested in paying for o1 pro if I had pdfs enabled, but… yeah. China Talk covers developments. The headline conclusion is that yes, compute very much will continue to be a key factor, everyone agrees on this. They note there is a potential budding DeepSeek partnership with ByteDance, which could unlock quite a lot of compute. Here was some shade: Founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng is the core person of DeepSeek. He is not the same type of person as Sam Altman. He is very knowledgeable about technology. Also important at least directionally: Pioneers vs. Chasers: ‘AI Progress Resembles a Step Function – Chasers Require 1/10th the Compute’ Fundamentally, DeepSeek was far more of an innovator than other Chinese AI companies, but it was still a chaser here, not a pioneer, except in compute efficiency, which is what chasers do best. If you want to maintain a lead and it’s much easier to follow than lead, well, time to get good and scale even more. Or you can realize you’re just feeding capability to the Chinese and break down crying and maybe keep your models for internal use, it’s an option. I found this odd: It’s odd because DeepSeek spent so little compute, and the efficiency gains pay for themselves in compute quite rapidly. And also the big companies are indeed releasing rapidly. Google and OpenAI are constantly shipping, even Anthropic ships. The idea of company focus seems more on point, and yes DeepSeek traded multimodality and other features for pure efficiency because they had to. Also note what they say later: As in, r1 is technically impressive as hell, and it definitely has its uses, but there’s a reason the existing models look like they do – the corners DeepSeek cut actually do matter for what people want. Of course DeepSeek will likely now turn to fixing such problems among other things and we’ll see how efficiently they can do that too. McKay Wrigley emphasizes the point that visible chain of thought (CoT) is a prompt debugger. It’s hard to go back to not seeing CoT after seeing CoT. Gallabytes reports that DeepSeek’s image model Janus Pro is a good first effort, but not good yet. Even if we were to ‘fully unlock’ all computing power in personal PCs for running AI, that would only increase available compute by ~10%, most compute is in data centers. We had a brief period where DeepSeek would serve you up r1 free and super fast. It turns out that’s not fully sustainable or at least needs time to scale as fast as demand rose, and you know how such folks feel about the ‘raise prices’ meme, Gallabytes: got used to r1 and now that it’s overloaded it’s hard to go back. @deepseek_ai please do something amazing and be the first LLM provider to offer surge pricing. the unofficial APIs are unusably slow. I too encountered slowness, and instantly it made me realize ‘yes the speed was a key part of why I loved this.’ DeItaone (January 27, 11:09am): DEEPSEEK SAYS SERVICE DEGRADED DUE TO ‘LARGE-SCALE MALICIOUS ATTACK’ Could be that. Could be too much demand and not enough supply. This will of course sort itself out in time, as long as you’re willing to pay, and it’s an open model so others can serve the model as well, but ‘everyone wants to use the shiny new model you are offering for free’ is going to run into obvious problems. Yes, of course one consideration is that if you use DeepSeek’s app it will collect all your data including device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address and so on and store it all in China. Did you for a second think otherwise? What you do with that info is on you. This doesn’t appear to rise to TikTok 2.0 levels of rendering your phone and data insecure, but let us say that ‘out of an abundance of caution’ I will be accessing the model through their website not the app thank you very much. Liv Boeree: tiktok round two, here we go. AI enthusiasts have the self control of an incontinent chihuahua. Typing Loudly: you can run it locally without an internet connection Liv Boeree: cool and what percentage of these incontinent chihuahuas will actually do this. I’m not going so far as to use third party providers for now, because I’m not feeding any sensitive data into the model, and DeepSeek’s implementation here is very nice and clean, so I’ve decided lazy is acceptable. I’m certainly not laying out ~$6,000 for a self-hosting rig, unless someone wants to buy one for me in the name of science. Note that if you’re looking for an alternative source, you want to ensure you’re not getting one of the smaller distillations, unless that is what you want. Janus is testing for steganography in r1, potentially looking for assistance. Janus also thinks Thebes theory here is likely to be true, that v3 was hurt by dividing into too many too small experts, but r1 lets them all dump their info into the CoT and collaborate, at least partially fixing this. Janus notes that r1 simply knows things and thinks about them, straight up, in response to Thebes speculating that all our chain of thought considerations have now put sufficient priming into the training data that CoT approaches work much better than they used to, which Prithviraj says is not the case, he says it’s about improved base models, which is the first obvious thought – the techniques work better off a stronger base, simple as that. Thebes: why did R1’s RL suddenly start working, when previous attempts to do similar things failed? theory: we’ve basically spent the last few years running a massive acausally distributed chain of thought data annotation program on the pretraining dataset. deepseek’s approach with R1 is a pretty obvious method. They are far from the first lab to try “slap a verifier on it and roll out CoTs.” But it didn’t used to work that well. … In the last couple of years, chains of thought have been posted all over the internet … Those CoTs in the V3 training set gave GRPO enough of a starting point to start converging, and furthermore, to generalize from verifiable domains to the non-verifiable ones using the bridge established by the pretraining data contamination. And now, R1’s visible chains of thought are going to lead to *another* massive enrichment of human-labeled reasoning on the internet, but on a far larger scale… The next round of base models post-R1 will be *even better* bases for reasoning models. in some possible worlds, this could also explain why OpenAI seemingly struggled so much with making their reasoning models in comparison. if they’re still using 4base or distils of it. Prithvraj: Simply, no. I’ve been looking at my old results from doing RL with “verifiable” rewards (math puzzle games, python code to pass unit tests) starting from 2019 with GPT-1/2 to 2024 with Qwen Math Deepseek’s success likely lies in the base models improving, the RL is constant Janus: This is an interesting hypothesis. DeepSeek R1 also just seems to have a much more lucid and high-resolution understanding of LLM ontology and history than any other model I’ve seen. (DeepSeek V3 did not seem to in my limited interactions with it, though.) I did not expect this on priors for a reasoner, but perhaps the main way that r1 seems smarter than any other LLM I’ve played with is the sheer lucidity and resolution of its world model—in particular, its knowledge of LLMs, both object- and meta-level, though this is also the main domain of knowledge I’ve engaged it in, and perhaps the only one I can evaluate at world-expert level. So, it may apply more generally. In effective fluid intelligence and attunement to real-time context, it actually feels weaker than, say, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. But when I talk to Sonnet about my ideas on LLMs, it feels like it is more naive than me, and it is figuring out a lot of things in context from “first principles.” When I talk to Opus about these things, it feels like it is understanding me by projecting the concepts onto more generic, resonant hyperobjects in its prior, meaning it is easy to get on the same page philosophically, but this tropological entanglement is not very precise. But with r1, it seems like it can simply reference the same concrete knowledge and ontology I have, much more like a peer. And it has intense opinions about these things. Wordgrammer thread on the DeepSeek technical breakthroughs. Here’s his conclusion, which seems rather overdetermined: Wordgrammer: “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. r1 tells us it only takes ~800k samples of ‘good’ RL reasoning to convert other models into RL reasoners, and Alex Dimakis says it could be a lot less, in his test they outperformed o1-preview with only 17k. Now that r1 is out, everyone permanently has an unlimited source of at least pretty good samples. From now on, to create or release a model is to create or release the RL version of that model, even more than before. That’s on top of all the other modifications you automatically release. Oliver Blanchard: DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive tfp shock in the history of the world. The nerdy version, to react to some of the comments. (Yes, electricity was big): DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive one day change in the present discounted value of total factor productivity growth in the history of the world. James Steuart: I can’t agree Professor, Robert Gordon’s book gives many such greater examples. Electric lighting is a substantially greater TFP boost than marginally better efficiency in IT and professional services! There were some bigger inventions in the past, but on much smaller baselines. Our reaction to this was to sell the stocks of those who provide the inputs that enable that tfp shock. There were other impacts as well, including to existential risk, but as we’ve established the market isn’t ready for that conversation in the sense that the market (highly reasonably as has been previously explained) will be ignoring it entirely. Daniel Eth: Hot take, but if the narrative from NYT et al had not been “lol you don’t need that many chips to train AI systems” but instead “Apparently AI is *not* hitting a wall”, then the AI chip stocks would have risen instead of fallen. Billy Humblebrag: “Deepseek shows that ai can be built more cheaply than we thought so you don’t need to worry about ai” is a hell of a take Joe Weisenthal: Morgan Stanley: “We gathered feedback from a number of industry sources and the consistent takeaway is that this is not affecting plans for GPU buildouts.” I would not discount the role of narrative and vibes in all this. I don’t think that’s the whole Nvidia drop or anything. But it matters. Roon: Plausible reasons for Nvidia drop: We will want more compute now until the heat death of the universe; it’s the only reason that doesn’t make sense. Palmer Lucky: The markets are not smarter on AI. The free hand is not yet efficient because the number of legitimate experts in the field is near-zero. The average person making AI calls on Wall Street had no idea what AI even was a year ago and feels compelled to justify big moves. Alex Cheema notes that Apple was up on Monday, and that Apple’s chips are great for running v3 and r1 inference. Alex Cheema: Market close: $NVDA: -16.91% | $AAPL: +3.21% Why is DeepSeek great for Apple? Here’s a breakdown of the chips that can run DeepSeek V3 and R1 on the market now: NVIDIA H100: 80GB @ 3TB/s, $25,000, $312.50 per GB AMD MI300X: 192GB @ 5.3TB/s, $20,000, $104.17 per GB Apple M2 Ultra: 192GB @ 800GB/s, $5,000, $26.04(!!) per GB Apple’s M2 Ultra (released in June 2023) is 4x more cost efficient per unit of memory than AMD MI300X and 12x more cost efficient than NVIDIA H100! Eric Hartford: 3090s, $700 for 24gb = $29/gb. Alex Cheema: You need a lot of hardware around them to load a 700GB model in 30 RTX 3090s. I’d love to see it though, closest to this is probably stacking @__tinygrad__ boxes. That’s cute. But I do not think that was the main reason why Apple was up. I think Apple was up because their strategy doesn’t depend on having frontier models but it does depend on running AIs on iPhones. Apple can now get their own distillations of r1, and use them for Apple Intelligence. A highly reasonable argument. The One True Newsletter, Matt Levine’s Money Stuff, is of course on the case of DeepSeek’s r1 crashing the stock market, and asking what cheap inference for everyone would do to market prices. He rapidly shifts focus to non-AI companies, asking which ones benefit. It’s great if you use AI to make your management company awesome, but not if you get cut out because AI replaces your management company. (And you. And the people it manages. And all of us. And maybe we all die.) But I digress. (To digress even further: While I’m reading that column, I don’t understand why we should care about the argument under ‘Dark Trading,’ since this mechanism decreases retail transaction costs to trade and doesn’t impact long term price discovery at all, and several LLMs confirmed this once challenged.) Ben Thompson continues to give his completely different kind of technical tech company perspective, in FAQ format, including good technical explanations that agree with what I’ve said in previous columns. Here’s a fascinating line: Q: I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! A: My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. That sounds like Ben Thompson is calling it a wrong-way move, and indeed later he explicitly endorses Jevons Paradox and expects compute use to rise. The market is supposed to factor in the long run now. There is no ‘this makes the price go down today and then up next week’ unless you’re very much in the ‘the EMH is false’ camp. And these are literally the most valuable companies in the world. Here’s another key one: Q: So are we close to AGI? A: It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. Masayoshi Sun feels the AGI. Masayoshi Sun feels everything. He’s king of feeling it. His typical open-model-stanning arguments on existential risk later in the past are as always disappointing, but in no way new or unexpected. It continues to astound me that such intelligent people can think: Well, there’s no stopping us creating things more capable and intelligent than humans, so the best way to ensure that things smarter than more capable than humans go well for humans is to ensure that there are as many such entities as possible and that humans cannot possibly have any collective control over those new entities. On another level, of course, I’ve accepted that people do think this. That they somehow cannot fathom that if you create things more intelligent and capable and competitive than humans there could be the threat that all the humans would end up with no power, rather than that the wrong humans might have too much power. Or think that this would be a good thing – because the wrong humans wouldn’t have power. Similarly, Ben’s call for absolutely no regulations whatsoever, no efforts at safety whatsoever outside of direct profit motives, ‘cut out all the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning,’ is exactly the kind of rhetoric I worry about getting us all killed in response to these developments. I should still reiterate that Ben to his credit is very responsible and accurate here in his technical presentation, laying out what DeepSeek and r1 are and aren’t accomplishing here rather than crying missile gap. But the closing message remains the same. The term Trump uses is ‘tariffs.’ I propose, at least in the context of GPUs, that we call these ‘import restrictions,’ in order to point out that we are (I believe wisely!) imposing ‘export restrictions’ as a matter of national security to ensure we get all the chips, and using diffusion regulations to force the chips to be hosted at home, then we are threatening to impose ‘up to 100%’ tariffs on those same chips, because ‘they left us’ and they want ‘to force them to come back,’ and they’ll build the new factories here instead of there, with their own money, because of the threat. Except for the fact that we really, really want the data centers at home. The diffusion regulations are largely to force companies to create them at home. Arthur B: Regarding possible US tariffs on Taiwan chips. First, this is one that US consumers would directly feel, it’s less politically feasible than tariffs on imports with lots of substitutes. Second, data centers don’t have to be located in the US. Canada is next door and has plenty of power. Dhiraj: Taiwan made the largest single greenfield FDI in US history through TSMC. Now, instead of receiving gratitude for helping the struggling US chip industry, Taiwan faces potential tariffs. In his zero-sum worldview, there are no friends. The whole thing is insane! Completely nuts. If he’s serious. And yes he said this on Joe Rogan previously, but he said a lot of things previously that he didn’t mean. Whereas Trump’s worldview is largely the madman theory, at least for trade. If you threaten people with insane moves that would hurt both of you, and show that you’re willing to actually enact insane moves, then they are forced to give you what you want. In this case, what Trump wants is presumably for TSMC to announce they are building more new chip factories in America. I agree that this would be excellent, assuming they were actually built. We have an existence proof that it can be done, and it would greatly improve our strategic position and reduce geopolitical risk. I presume Trump is mostly bluffing, in that he has no intention of actually imposing these completely insane tariffs, and he will ultimately take a minor win and declare victory. But what makes it nerve wracking is that, by design, you never know. If you did know none of this would ever work. Unless, some people wondered, there was another explanation for all this… Nabeel Qureshi (Tuesday, 2pm): Crazy that people in this corner of X have a faster OODA loop than the stock market This was the largest single day drop in a single stock in world history. It wiped out over $500 billion in market value. One had to wonder if it was partially insider trading. Timothy Lee: Everyone says DeepSeek caused Nvidia’s stock to crash yesterday. I think this theory makes no sense. DeepSeek’s success isn’t bad news for Nvidia. I don’t think that this was insider trading. The tariff threat was already partly known and thus priced in. It’s a threat rather than an action, which means it’s likely a bluff. That’s not a 17% move. Then we have the bounceback on Tuesday. Even if I was certain that this was mostly an insider trading move instead of being rather confident it mostly or entirely wasn’t, I wouldn’t go as far as Eliezer does in the the below quote. The SEC does many important things. But I do notice that there’s a non-zero amount of ‘wait a minute’ that will occur to me the next time I’m hovering around the buy button in haste. Eliezer Yudkowsky: I heard from many people who said, “An NVDA drop makes no sense as a Deepseek reaction; buying NVDA.” So those people have now been cheated by insider counterparties with political access. They may make fewer US trades in the future. Also note that the obvious meaning of this news is that someone told and convinced Trump that China will invade Taiwan before the end of his term, and the US needs to wean itself off Taiwanese dependence. This was a $400B market movement, and if @SECGov can’t figure out who did it then the SEC has no reason to exist. TBC, I’m not saying that figuring it out would be easy or bringing the criminals to justice would be easy. I’m saying that if the US markets are going to be like this anyway on $400B market movements, why bother paying the overhead cost of having an SEC that doesn’t work? Roon: [Trump’s tariff threats about Taiwan] didn’t move overnight markets at all which either means markets either: – don’t believe it’s credible – were pricing this in yesterday while internet was blaming the crash out on deepseek I certainly don’t agree that the only interpretation of this news is ‘Trump expects an invasion of Taiwan.’ Trump is perfectly capable of doing this for exactly the reasons he’s saying. Trump is also fully capable of making this threat with no intention of following through, in order to extract concessions from Taiwan or TSMC, perhaps of symbolic size. Trump is also fully capable of doing this so that he could inform his hedge fund friends in advance and they could make quite a lot of money – with or without any attempt to actually impose the tariffs ever, since his friends would have now covered their shorts in this scenario. Indeed do many things come to pass. I don’t know anything you don’t know. It would be a good sign if DeepSeek had a plan for safety, even if it wasn’t that strong? Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): DeepSeek should create a preparedness framework/RSP if they continue to scale reasoning models. Very happy to [help them with this]! We don’t quite have nothing. This below is the first actively positive sign for DeepSeek on safety, however small. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): Does DeepSeek have any safety researchers? What are Liang Wenfeng’s views on AI safety? Sarah (YuanYuanSunSara): [DeepSeek] signed Artificial Intelligence safety commitment by CAICT (gov backed institute). You can see the whale sign at the bottom if you can’t read their name Chinese. This involves AI safety governance structure, safety testing, do frontier AGI safety research (include loss of control) and share it publicly. None legally binding but it’s a good sign. Here is a chart with the Seoul Commitments versus China’s version. It is of course much better that DeepSeek signed onto a symbolic document like this. That’s a good sign, whereas refusing would have been a very bad sign. But as always, talk is cheap, this doesn’t concretely commit DeepSeek to much, and even fully abiding by commitments like this won’t remotely be enough. I do think this is a very good sign that agreements and coordination are possible. But if we want that, we will have to Pick Up the Phone. Here’s a weird different answer. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI, Head of Mission Alignment): I think a better question is whether or not science fiction culture in China has a fixation on the kinds of topics that would help them think about it. If Three-Body Problem is any indication, things will be OK. It’s a question worth asking, but I don’t think this is a better question? And based on the book, I do not think Three-Body Problem (conceptual spoilers follow, potentially severe ones depending on your perspective) is great here. Consider the decision theory that those books endorse, and what happens to us and also the universe as a result. It’s presenting all of that as essentially inevitable, and trying to think otherwise as foolishness. It’s endorsing that what matters is paranoia, power and a willingness to use it without mercy in an endless war of all against all. Also consider how they paint the history of the universe entirely without AGI. I want to be clear that I fully agree with Bill Gurley that ‘no one at DeepSeek is an enemy of mine,’ indeed There Is No Enemy Anywhere, with at most notably rare exceptions that I invite to stop being exceptions. However, I do think that if they continue down their current path, they are liable to get us all killed. And I for one am going to take the bold stance that I think that this is bad, and they should therefore alter their path before reaching their stated destination. How committed is DeepSeek to its current path? Read this quote Ben Thompson links to very carefully: Q: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. Answer from DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This is from November. And that’s not a no. That’s actually a maybe. Note what he didn’t say: A Different Answer: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem is more important. The difference? His answer includes the word ‘first.’ He’s saying that first you need a strong technical ecosystem, and he believes that open models are the key to attracting talent and developing a strong technical ecosystem. Then, once that exists, you would need to protect your advantage. And yes, that is exactly what happened with… OpenAI. I wanted to be sure that this translation was correct, so I turned to Wenfang’s own r1, and asked the interviewer for the original statement, which was: 梁文锋：我们不会闭源。我们认为先有一个强大的技术生态更重要。 r1’s translation: “We will not close our source code. We believe that establishing a strong technological ecosystem must come first.” To quote r1: Based solely on this statement, Liang is asserting that openness is non-negotiable because it is essential to the ecosystem’s strength. While no one can predict the future, the phrasing suggests a long-term commitment to open-source as a core value, not a temporary tactic. To fully guarantee permanence, you’d need additional evidence (e.g., licensing choices, governance models, past behavior). But as it stands, the statement leans toward “permanent” in spirit. I interpret this as a statement of a pragmatic motivation – if that motivation changes, or a more important one is created, actions would change. For now, yes, openness. The Washington Post had a profile of DeepSeek and Liang Wenfeng. One note is that the hedge fund that they’re a spinoff from has donated over $80 million to charity since 2020, which makes it more plausible DeepSeek has no business model, or at least no medium-term business model. But that government embrace is new for DeepSeek, said Matt Sheehan, an expert on China’s AI industry at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They were not the ‘chosen one’ of Chinese AI start-ups,” said Sheehan, noting that many other Chinese start-ups received more government funding and contracts. “DeepSeek took the world by surprise, and I think to a large extent, they took the Chinese government by surprise.” Sheehan added that for DeepSeek, more government attention will be a “double-edged sword.” While the company will probably have more access to government resources, “there’s going to be a lot of political scrutiny on them, and that has a cost of its own,” he said. Yes. This reinforces the theory that DeepSeek’s ascent took China’s government by surprise, and they had no idea what v3 and r1 were as they were released. Going forward, China is going to be far more aware. In some ways, DeepSeek will have lots of support. But there will be strings attached. That starts with the ordinary censorship demands of the CCP. If you self-host r1, and you ask it about any of the topics the CCP dislikes, r1 will give you a good, well-balanced answer. If you ask on DeepSeek’s website, it will censor you via some sort of cloud-based monitoring, which works if you’re closed source, but DeepSeek is trying to be fully open source. Something has to give, somewhere. Also, even if you’re using the official website, it’s not like you can’t get around it. Justine Moore: DeepSeek’s censorship is no match for the jailbreakers of Reddit I mean, that was easy. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI Head of Mission Alignment): This has deeply fascinating consequences for China in 10 years – when the CCP has to choose between allowing their AI industry to move forward, or maintaining censorship and tight ideological control, which will they choose? And if they choose their AI industry, especially if they favor open source as a strategy for worldwide influence: what does it mean for their national culture and government structure in the long run, when everyone who is curious can find ways to have subversive conversations? Ten years to figure this out? If they’re lucky, they’ve got two. My guess is they don’t. I worry about the failure to feel the AGI or even the AI here from Joshua Achiam, given his position at OpenAI. Ten years is a long time. Sam Altman expects AGI well before that. This goes well beyond Altman’s absurd position of ‘AGI will be invented and your life won’t noticeably change for a long time.’ Choices are going to need to be made. Even if AI doesn’t advance much from here, choices will have to be made. As I’ve noted before, censorship at the model layer is expensive. It’s harder to do, and when you do it you risk introducing falsity into a mind in ways that will have widespread repercussions. Even then, a fine tune can easily remove any gaps in knowledge, or any reluctance to discuss particular topics, whether they are actually dangerous things like building bombs or things that piss off the CCP like a certain bear that loves honey. I got called out on Twitter for supposed cognitive dissonance on this – look at China’s actions, they clearly let this happen. Again, my claim is that China didn’t realize what this was until after it happened, they can’t undo it (that’s the whole point!) and they are of course going to embrace their national champion. That has little to do with what paths DeepSeek is allowed to follow going forward. (Also, since it was mentioned in that response, I should note – there is a habit of people conflating ‘pause’ with ‘ever do anything to regulate AI at all.’ I do not believe I said anything about a pause – I was talking about whether China would let DeepSeek continue to release open weights as capabilities improve.) Before I further cover potential policy responses, a question we must ask this week is: I very much do not wish to do this at this time, but suppose in the future we did want to restrict use of a particular already open weights model and its derivatives, or all models in some reference class. What would our options be? Obviously we couldn’t fully ban it in terms of preventing determined people from having access. And if you try to stop them and others don’t, there are obvious problems with that, including ‘people have internet connections.’ However, that does not mean that we would have actual zero options. Steve Sailer: Does open source, low cost DeepSeek mean that there is no way, short of full-blown Butlerian Jihad against computers, which we won’t do, to keep AI bottled up, so we’re going to find out if Yudkowsky’s warnings that AI will go SkyNet and turn us into paperclips are right? Gabriel: It’s a psy-op If hosting a 70B is illegal: – Almost all individuals stop – All companies stop – All research labs stop – All compute providers stop Already huge if limited to US+EU Can argue about whether good/bad, but not about the effect size. You can absolutely argue about effect size. What you can’t argue is that the effect size isn’t large. It would make a big difference for many practical purposes. In terms of my ‘Levels of Friction’ framework (post forthcoming) this is moving the models from Level 1 (easy to access) to at least Level 3 (annoying with potential consequences.) That has big practical consequences, and many important use cases will indeed go away or change dramatically. What Level 3 absolutely won’t do, here or elsewhere, is save you from determined people who want it badly enough, or from sufficiently capable models that do not especially care what you tell them not to do or where you tell them not to be. Or scenarios where the law is no longer especially relevant, and the government or humanity is very much having a ‘do you feel in charge?’ moment. And that alone would, in many scenarios, be enough to doom you to varying degrees. If that’s what dooms you and the model is already open, well, you’re pretty doomed. And also it won’t save you from various scenarios where what the law thinks is not especially relevant. If for whatever reason the government or humanity decides (or realizes) that this is insufficient, then there are two possibilities. Either the government or humanity is disempowered and you hope that this works out for humanity in some way. Or we use the necessary means to push the restrictions up to Level 4 (akin to rape and murder) or Level 5 (akin to what we do to stop terrorism or worse), in ways I assure you that you are very much not going to like – but the alternative might be worse, and the decision might very much not be up to either of us. Actions have consequences. Plan for them. Adam Ozimek was first I saw point out this time around with DeepSeek (I and many others echo this a lot in general) that the best way for the Federal Government to ensure American dominance of AI is to encourage more high skilled immigration and brain drain the world. If you don’t want China to have DeepSeek, export controls are great and all but how about let’s straight up steal their engineers. But y’all, and by y’all I mean Donald Trump, aren’t ready for that conversation. It is highly unfortunate that David Sacks, the person seemingly in charge of what AI executive orders Trump signs, is so deeply confused about what various provisions actually did or would do, and on our regulatory situation relative to that of China. David Sacks: DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not.) I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent. Donald Trump: The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win. … We’re going to dominate. We’ll dominate everything. This is the biggest danger of all – that we go full Missile Gap jingoism and full-on race to ‘beat China,’ and act like we can’t afford to do anything to ensure the safety of the AGIs and ASIs we plan on building, even pressuring labs not to make such efforts in private, or threatening them with antitrust or other interventions for trying. The full Trump clip is hilarious, including him saying they may have come up with a cheaper method but ‘no one knows if it is true.’ His main thrust is, oh, you made doing AI cheaper and gave it all away to us for free, thanks, that’s great! I love paying less money for things! And he’s presumably spinning, but he’s also not wrong about that. I also take some small comfort in him framing revoking the Biden EO purely in terms of wokeness. If that’s all he thinks was bad about it, that’s a great sign. Harlan Stewart: “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment” Sure. I guess it’s like if the Soviets had told the world how to make their own Sputniks and also offered everyone a lifetime supply of free Sputniks. And the US had already previously figured out how to make an even bigger Sputnik. Yishan: I think the Deepseek moment is not really the Sputnik moment, but more like the Google moment. If anyone was around in ~2004, you’ll know what I mean, but more on that later. I think everyone is over-rotated on this because Deepseek came out of China. Let me try to un-rotate you. Deepseek could have come out of some lab in the US Midwest. Like say some CS lab couldn’t afford the latest nVidia chips and had to use older hardware, but they had a great algo and systems department, and they found a bunch of optimizations and trained a model for a few million dollars and lo, the model is roughly on par with o1. Look everyone, we found a new training method and we optimized a bunch of algorithms! Everyone is like OH WOW and starts trying the same thing. Great week for AI advancement! No need for US markets to lose a trillion in market cap. The tech world (and apparently Wall Street) is massively over-rotated on this because it came out of CHINA. … Deepseek is MUCH more like the Google moment, because Google essentially described what it did and told everyone else how they could do it too. … There is no reason to think nVidia and OAI and Meta and Microsoft and Google et al are dead. Sure, Deepseek is a new and formidable upstart, but doesn’t that happen every week in the world of AI? I am sure that Sam and Zuck, backed by the power of Satya, can figure something out. Everyone is going to duplicate this feat in a few months and everything just got cheaper. The only real consequence is that AI utopia/doom is now closer than ever. I believe that alignment, and getting a good outcome for humans, was already going to be very hard. It’s going to be a lot harder if we actively try to get ourselves killed like this, and turn even what would have been relatively easy wins into losses. Whereas no, actually, if you want to win that has to include not dying, and also doing the alignment work helps you win, because it is the only way you can (sanely) get to deploy your AIs to do the most valuable tasks. Trump’s reaction of ‘we’ll dominate everything’ is far closer to correct. Our ‘lead’ is smaller than we thought, DeepSeek will be real competition, but we are very much still in the dominant position. We need to not lose sight of that. The Washington Post covers panic in Washington, and attempts to exploit this situation to do the opposite of wise policy. Tiku, Dou, Zakrzewski and De Vynck: Tech stocks dropped Monday. Spooked U.S. officials, engineers and investors reconsidered their views on the competitive threat posed by China in AI, and how the United States could stay ahead. While some Republicans and the Trump administration suggested the answer was to restrain China, prominent tech industry voices said DeepSeek’s ascent showed the benefits of openly sharing AI technology instead of keeping it closely held. This shows nothing of the kind, of course. DeepSeek fast followed, copied our insights and had insights of their own. Our insights were held insufficiently closely to prevent this, which at that stage was mostly unavoidable. They have now given away many of those new valuable insights, which we and others will copy, and also made the situation more dangerous. We should exploit that and learn from it, not make the same mistake. Robert Sterling: Might be a dumb question, but can’t OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies just incorporate the best parts of DeepSeek’s source code into their code, then use the massive GPU clusters at their disposal to train models even more powerful than DeepSeek? Am I missing something? Peter Wildeford: Not a dumb question, this is 100% correct And they already have more powerful models than Deepseek I fear we are caught between two different insane reactions. Restraining China is a good idea if implemented well, but insufficiently specified. Restrain them how? If this means export controls, I strongly agree – and then ask when we are then considering imposing those controls on ourselves via tariffs? What else is available? And I will keep saying ‘how about immigration to brain drain them’ because it seems wrong to ignore the utterly obvious. Chamath Palihapitiya says it’s inference time, we need to boot up our allies with it as quickly as possible (I agree) and that we should also boot up China by lifting export controls on inference chips, and also focus on supplying the Middle East. He notes he has a conflict of interest here. It seems not especially wise to hand over serious inference compute if we’re in a fight here. With the way these models are going, there’s a decent amount of fungibility between inference and training, and also there’s going to be tons of demand for inference. Why is it suddenly important to Chamath that the inference be done on chips we sold them? Capitalist insists rope markets must remain open during this trying time, and so on. (There’s also talk about ‘how asleep we’ve been for 15 years’ because we’re so inefficient and seriously everyone needs to calm down on this kind of thinking.) So alas, in the short run, we are left scrambling to prevent two equal and opposite deadly mistakes we seem to be dangerously close to collectively making. The CEO of DeepSeek himself said in November that the export controls and inability to access chips were the limiting factors on what they could do. Compute is vital. What did DeepSeek ask for with its newfound prestige? Support for compute infrastructure in China. Do not respond by being so suicidal as to remove or weaken those controls. Or, to shorten all that: Don’t do those things! Do take advantage of all the opportunities that have been opened up. And of course: Don’t panic!

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Nvidia Stock Pulls Back Again

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model.

In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: Microsoft thinks China's DeepSeek might have used OpenAI's tech before its big breakthrough

Microsoft (MSFT-0.16%) and OpenAI are investigating whether a group connected to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek accessed OpenAI’s data without permission, according to a new report. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Microsoft’s security team noticed unusual activity last fall in which individuals, believed to be linked to DeepSeek, accessed large amounts of data through OpenAI’s application programming interface (API). The ChatGPT maker’s API allows software developers to license and use the company’s proprietary AI models into their own applications. However, the breach may have violated OpenAI’s terms of service and appeared to be an attempt to bypass restrictions on how much data can be accessed from the service. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, flagged the issue to the company, Bloomberg reports. Last week, the Hangzhou-based AI startup DeepSeek introduced its first-generation, open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, that demonstrated comparable performance to OpenAI’s reasoning models. The release prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks, with the Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P 500 all falling Monday morning. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA-2.79%) saw its stock plummet 17%, losing close to $600 billion in value — the largest single-day market cap loss ever for a U.S. company. At the same time, the mobile app for DeepSeek’s AI chatbot, also called DeepSeek, surged to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-3.41%) App Store, while its site experienced outages from an influx of new users. Investors were spooked by the Chinese startup, which released its DeepSeek-V3 model in December that it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. U.S. rivals such as OpenAI and Meta have touted spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s more powerful chips. The U.S. National Security Council is already reviewing the potential national security risks associated with DeepSeek, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. Leavitt noted that President Donald Trump views the startup’s newly released AI model as a “wake-up call” for American developers. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tech led stocks lower on Wednesday morning as the broader mood stayed muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more 0.7%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down about 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat. The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Investors will listen for answers to two key questions at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference: How much further will the Fed cut rates and has the central bank changed its stance in light of President Trump's early tariff moves? Meanwhile, a surprise rise in bookings for ASML (ASML), a key toolmaker in the AI chip chain, gave another boost to techs starting to recover from a bruising start to the week. Shares of ASML popped 5% in early trading, with peers like Applied Materials (AMAT) also making gains. Nvidia (NVDA), however, didn't catch a boost, with shares down nearly 5%, as its Tuesday comeback faltered. Markets are now taking a cooler look at Chinese startup DeepSeek's challenge to assumptions about AI spending and costs. Shares of Alibaba (BABA) moved up more than 4% after the Chinese tech giant released a new AI model that it said is better than DeepSeek's rival to ChatGPT. The saga deepened with claims by Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI that DeepSeek used its proprietary models to train its competitor. The spotlight is now on the guidance in Meta (META) and Microsoft's quarterly results, due after the bell, for reassurance that Big Tech's heavy AI spending will pay off in growth. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out Wednesday's megacap earnings, with Wall Street watching for a new catalyst to jump-start the stock. Starbucks (SBUX) shares are up more than 5% after reporting quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol is promising more caffeinated growth but isn't yet ready to put hard projections around when. And for now, that continues to be enough for Wall Street. On its earnings call, the company highlighted improved sequential sales trends in the US as it worked to speed up mobile orders and end upcharging for dairy substitutes, among other changes. "I think we're definitely in the middle of a turnaround," Niccol said on Yahoo Finance. Read more here. It's been a whipsaw week of trading action for AI leader Nvidia (NVDA). The stock lost a record $589 billion in market cap on Monday, with shares falling roughly 17% as a new artificial intelligence model from China's DeepSeek raised questions about AI investment and the rise of more cost-efficient AI agents. Then Tuesday brought a rebound, with the stock closing 9% higher. But Wednesday's early action saw the the stock fall nearly 4%. That shows the AI chipmaker isn't out of the woods yet, as investors await earnings results from key Nvidia customers after the bell in Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA). ASML (ASML) stock rose 6% early Wednesday after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips. ASML sells highly complex machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses those machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights. The Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of 6.85 euros ($7.12), ahead of the 6.68 euros expected. Its quarterly revenue of 9.2 billion euros topped the 9 billion euros forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. ASML also posted stronger-than-expected order bookings, reflecting strong demand from AI chipmakers for its advanced tools. Meanwhile, its CEO Christophe Fouquet told CNBC in an interview about the impact of DeepSeek's new AI models: “We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand." Read the full story here. Stocks wavered on Wednesday morning with the broader mood muted ahead of the first Big Tech earnings and the Federal Reserve's rate decision. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell more than 0.3%, after a bounce-back rally on Tuesday.

The looming Fed policy verdict is providing reason for markets to tread carefully, even though the central bank is expected to stand pat on interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) shares rose nearly 15% in premarket trading after the company linked to President Donald Trump announced an expansion into financial services. The operator of Truth Social will launch a financial services and fintech brand dubbed "Truth.Fi." The board approved a $250 million investment of its cash reserves into customized separately managed accounts (SMAs), customized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities. "We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we're moving into investment products and decentralized finance," TMTG CEO and chairman Devin Nunes said in the release. "Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by Big Tech and woke corporations." Oppenheimer has joined its peers at Loop Capital and Jefferies in cutting its rating on shares of Apple (AAPL) in the run-up to the company's fiscal first quarter results, due out after the bell tomorrow. OpCo cut its rating on Apple to Perform from Outperform, according to a report from Bloomberg, with the firm citing slowing iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation, similar cases to those made by Loop and Jefferies last week. On Monday, Apple was a market leader amid a washout in AI-related plays, most notably Nvidia (NVDA), which lost nearly $600 billion in market value. This was a silver lining of sorts during a period in which the company has been a notable laggard relative to its peers in deploying AI across its product line.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock tanked on Monday, falling more than 17% and losing nearly $600 billion off its market cap, as investors digested a new cost-effective artificial intelligence model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. But retail investors bought the dip. Data from VandaTrack shows retail investors bought more than $562 million of the name on Monday, the largest single day inflow into the stock in VandaTrack's data. On Tuesday, as the stock rebounded and rose roughly 9%, there was once again a large swath of retail buying totaling nearly $360 million. Across the two days of chaotic market action, retail investors sent more than $920 million into shares of Nvidia. Wall street strategists largely agreed with retail's bullish outlook on the name. "We think this is probably going to end up a buy the dip Nvidia moment," Fundstrat head of Research Tom Lee said in a video to clients on Monday night. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon told Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith the DeepSeek driven sell-off was "overblown." Rasgon added that the new developments don't spell out "doomsday for AI infrastructure."

Title: Is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the Cheap AI Stock to Buy in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a buzzword around Wall Street for most of 2024. AI has shown immense promise but comes with significant risks. Big AI players are dominating the broader market, but there will be opportunities for other companies to explore as the AI market continues to expand. For instance, the new administration is keen on technological advancement, and recently, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI initiative, a joint venture known as Stargate between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle. However, DeepSeek’s introduction shocked the U.S. companies after it released a new AI model, a much better alternative to GPT-4. DeepSeek claims to have designed the AI model in just two months and at around under $6 million using Nvidia’s less-advanced H800 chips, as reported by Reuters on January 27. Since the news broke out, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have plunged over 16%, wiping away $600 billion in market capitalization, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead, speaking to Market Domination, shared his views on DeepSeek. Moorhead was impressed by the efficiency of DeepSeek’s AI. He pointed out that the Chinese have used different techniques compared to American developers, where they were able to parse or train maybe 5% of the data, which is a 95% reduction. However, Moorhead also addressed the U.S. market drop as an “overreaction.” “I think the market overall should be going crazy because [this is the] uplift of what we were looking for [from AI],” said Moorhead. He added that the investors’ focus should be on the progress in inference. It might be a good time to invest in AI stocks, especially cheap AI stocks during the market’s overreaction. To determine the list of cheap AI stocks, we went through various news articles and stock analyses. We shortlisted the AI stocks with the minimum analyst upside of 30%, as of January 27. Cheap, in the context of this article, means stocks that Wall Street analysts believe are undervalued and will surge to higher share prices. We have ranked the cheap AI stocks to buy based on their popularity among hedge funds, as of Q3 2024, in ascending order. Why do we care about what hedge funds do?

Where NVDA led the AI boom in 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares plunged over 35% in the last year. Earlier in December 2024, someone asked Jim Cramer if he was worried about AMD and the stock’s underperformance. Here is what Cramer said: “This is very difficult, and you’re absolutely right to bring it up, and I’m glad you did. Here’s the problem. It is absolutely true—it is absolutely true that they’re not doing as well as Nvidia. It is true that they do not have the big Amazon orders that I’ve been looking at. But can we just remember that Lisa Su has built an amazing company, taking a lot of shares from Intel? She got the number two when it comes to the data center, when it comes to AI, and come on, she just did the great deal where she got all these engineers to come in. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has transformed its business from a struggling company to a semiconductor leader, with its stock jumping from $3 to $115 over a decade, as of January 27. In 2024, AMD introduced the Instinct MI325X AI accelerators and next-generation networking solutions, focusing on strengthening its position in the AI data center market. The company’s majority of revenue comes from data center sales. In 2024, the company acquired ZT Systems for around $5 billion. The ZT Systems purchase will further help Advanced Micro Devices in improving its market share in AI data centers. During the third quarter of 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) posted a revenue of $6.82 billion, up by 18% year-over-year and beating estimates by $104.33 million. The data center revenue accounted for $3.5 billion, up 122% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU sales. On January 21, Citi maintained a Buy rating on AMD shares and lowered the price target from $200 to $175. The firm expects a drop in semiconductor sales due to weaker demand in PC, automotive, and industrial markets. However, analysts project AMD’s data center business to expand, driven by AI sales. Overall, AMD ranks 4th on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other cheap AI stocks to buy in 2025. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was a buzzword around Wall Street for most of 2024. AI has shown immense promise but comes with significant risks. Big AI players are dominating the broader market, but there will be opportunities for other companies to explore as the AI market continues to expand. For instance, the new administration is keen on technological advancement, and recently, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI initiative, a joint venture known as Stargate between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle. However, DeepSeek’s introduction shocked the U.S. companies after it released a new AI model, a much better alternative to GPT-4. DeepSeek claims to have designed the AI model in just two months and at around under $6 million using Nvidia’s less-advanced H800 chips, as reported by Reuters on January 27. Since the news broke out, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have plunged over 16%, wiping away $600 billion in market capitalization, the biggest one-day loss in U.S. history. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead, speaking to Market Domination, shared his views on DeepSeek. Moorhead was impressed by the efficiency of DeepSeek’s AI. He pointed out that the Chinese have used different techniques compared to American developers, where they were able to parse or train maybe 5% of the data, which is a 95% reduction. However, Moorhead also addressed the U.S. market drop as an “overreaction.” “I think the market overall should be going crazy because [this is the] uplift of what we were looking for [from AI],” said Moorhead. He added that the investors’ focus should be on the progress in inference. It might be a good time to invest in AI stocks, especially cheap AI stocks during the market’s overreaction.

Title: DeepSeek's AI breakthrough is calling Big Tech's big spending into question

Time Published: 2025-01-29T10:00:00Z

Big Tech’s multi-billion dollar spending on artificial intelligence will be under investor scrutiny this week — even more so after China’s DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley with a cheap yet competitive AI model. Ahead of earnings results from Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, the AI-driven stock rally lost $1 trillion in value after the Hangzhou-based AI startup demonstrated AI reasoning models on par with OpenAI and Anthropic. Last week’s release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks, with Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures all falling Monday morning. Nvidia (NVDA) stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. Investors were spooked by DeepSeek, which in December released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. According to the technical paper, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia for training — much less than the tens of thousands of chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. Meta (META), for example, used 16,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H100s to train its Llama 3 405B model. The tech giant and other U.S. rivals such as OpenAI have touted spending tens of billions on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company is planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and end up with more than 1.3 million GPUs. Meanwhile, OpenAI announced a new joint venture with tech heavyweights SoftBank (SFTBY) and Oracle (ORCL) to invest $500 billion in building new AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. DeepSeek’s seemingly efficient and competitive models could challenge Big Tech’s billions in spending on AI infrastructure — but it could also expand the market for AI. Despite questions over DeepSeek’s spending and distilled models, “there are a few clear breakthroughs which show the industry a path to cheaper means of both training and inference,” John Belton, a portfolio manager and analyst at Gabelli Funds, said in a statement shared with Quartz. Belton said DeepSeek’s methods raise questions of “great[er] innovation and therefore compute demand from Western customers,” who have more powerful chips than DeepSeek. Cheaper inferencing could expand the total-addressable-market, Belton said, as well as fulfill Jevon’s Paradox — the idea in economics that the more efficient it is to use a resource, the more likely consumption will increase. Meanwhile, cloud providers could see more demand as the cost of inferencing, or the process of a trained AI model making predictions from new data, declines — also a “definite positive” for AI developers such as Meta, Google (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), Belton said. While Jefferies (JEF)’ analyst said in a note that they “still think there will be a significant capex ramp for AI,” the cost of inferencing needs to scale down to reach mass AI adoption. It’s plausible the efficiency will lead to more demand for hardware to train proprietary models, Mark Klein, chief executive of SuRo Capital (SSSS), said in a statement shared with Quartz, but developers are still unsure how DeepSeek’s approach can scale with larger chip clusters. In the near term, AI-focused chip companies will be “unlikely to see meaningful change” in demand due to DeepSeek, considering supply constraints with chips, data center capacity, and power, analysts at William Blair said in a note. “Longer term, however, the continued pressure to lower the cost of compute—and the ability to reduce the cost of training and inference using new, more efficient algorithmic techniques—could result in lower capex than previously envisioned,” the analysts said. This could lessen Nvidia’s dominance, William Blair analysts said, especially if companies realize they don’t need large-scale chip clusters for frontier models. However, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the world’s largest companies are not “going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases.” “At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia,” Ives said in a statement shared with Quartz. “Launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing.....launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Jefferies analysts agreed that Nvidia will be OK. “They were overvalued anyway considering that we are only in first generation of this technology,” a Jefferies analyst said in a note. “Even with less demand for giant GPU data centers, the demand for inference machines will be off the charts.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: Trump is turning the fate of TikTok into a public bidding war

President Donald Trump apparently has no qualms about turning the fate of TikTok into a public bidding war. When prompted by specific questions from reporters, the new president tossed out some of the biggest names in the tech world as possible buyers of TikTok’s US operations — a deal that would allow the platform to get around a ban imposed by Congress in the name of national security. Among the names floated so far by Trump are Elon Musk, owner of X; Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle (ORCL); and Microsoft (MSFT). It's not yet clear if any are involved in actual discussions. "I like bidding wars because you make your best deals," Trump said Monday as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One. Trump said he wants a deal done in 30 days. An executive order he signed on his first day in office actually gives TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, until April 4 to figure something out. Here is a closer look at the big names mentioned by Trump — and others who have also gone public with their bids: Microsoft, along with Walmart (WMT), made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump’s first term when Trump actually tried to ban the app. When asked Monday if Microsoft was among the companies interested this time around in an ownership stake, Trump answered in the affirmative: "I would say yes." It is not yet known whether Microsoft is actually involved in any talks. Microsoft’s prior bid in 2020 didn’t go anywhere. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later said after those discussions fell apart that the federal government had a "particular set of requirements and then it just disappeared." He called it the "strangest thing I've ever worked on." The Chinese government will certainly have a say in whatever happens. And government officials in that country, according to reports by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the social media app’s US business to Musk. Trump sounded intrigued by the idea when asked about it publicly. "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump said of Musk, the owner of X when a reporter at the White House wanted to know if he was in favor of such a deal. But Musk has not spoken on the subject yet, except to say on X, “I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change." Antitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users. Another factor in his favor is that Musk has a close relationship with the incoming president, having spent more than $250 million supporting his reelection campaign and as he is helping lead a government cost-cutting effort as part of a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He also runs an electric vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), that has a factory in China and sells a lot of its cars to that part of the world. Trump has sent mixed signals about whether Ellison could play a role in the TikTok situation. "I’d like Larry to buy it too," the president said last week, with Ellison standing next to him at a press conference held to announce a new $500 billion artificial intelligence infrastructure commitment. "Larry, let’s negotiate in front of the media,” Trump said, as SoftBank CEO Masa Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also looked on. "What I’m thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half, and we’ll give you the permit. And they’ll have a great partner, the United States." "Sounds like a good deal to me, Mr. President," Ellison said. NPR later reported that the Trump administration was developing a plan that would move control of TikTok to Oracle, where Ellison is chair and chief technology officer, along with other outside investors. In that scenario, ByteDance would keep a minority stake in the company while Oracle would oversee the app’s algorithm and data collection. Oracle already acts as a service provider for TikTok, storing its videos and other content in data centers. But Trump denied talks with Oracle when asked about the subject Sunday. "No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days." He also denied any actual discussions with Ellison, saying "I never spoke to Larry about TikTok." Another bidder in the mix not yet mentioned by Trump is Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence startup backed by some Big Tech names: Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Nvidia (NVDA), and other venture capitalists. The AP reported this past weekend that Perplexity AI submitted a proposal to ByteDance that would merge Perplexity with TikTok’s US business and then give half ownership in that new company to the US government following an initial public offering. The AP also reported that TikTok’s US business would be merged with Perplexity AI without the platform’s proprietary algorithm, and the existing investors in ByteDance would receive equity in the new entity. One ByteDance board member, General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, told Axios last week during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that there could be a solution for TikTok that does not require a full divesture from ByteDance. General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), Sequoia Capital, and Susquehanna International Group are among the existing US investors in TikTok’s parent company. Former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who acknowledged last year he was assembling a team of investors to buy TikTok, said last weekend on Fox News’s "Sunday Morning Futures" that a new investor would "dilute down" Chinese ownership of TikTok. "I’d be very interested in participating," he said. Another billionaire interested in a potential TikTok deal is Frank McCourt, the founder of the internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers. "There's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business," McCourt has told Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast. "We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it." His group includes "Shark Tank" star Kevin O’Leary, who has told Yahoo Finance that he, McCourt, and a consortium of business professionals are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a "legacy opportunity." The famed investor told Yahoo Finance that the group’s proposal excludes the platform’s algorithm. McCourt told Reuters last week at Davos that he is open to teaming up with other investors. O’Leary is also still interested, he told CNBC, but the law banning TikTok, which went into effect on Jan. 19, makes things more difficult. "I would love to do a deal if the law provided for it, but I don’t have the luxury of breaching the order of Congress," he said to CNBC. One other group of investors has publicly announced its interest in buying TikTok, and it claims to have an internet celebrity in its corner. It includes Jesse Tinsley, founder and CEO of Employer.com. The web celebrity is Jimmy Donaldson, the popular YouTuber better known as "MrBeast." The group submitted an all-cash bid, according to a release from Paul Hastings LLP, which said it is representing the investors. The Paul Hastings team includes Brad Bondi, brother of Pam Bondi, Trump’s pick to be attorney general of the US. Tinsley said on X that "our goal is to ensure TikTok stays accessible, thriving, and aligned with the values that make America great," he wrote. His group, he added, is "ready to structure the deal in whatever way President Trump and our government wish."

Title: Jim Cramer Says Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)’s ‘No Longer A Cyclical’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) stands against the other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves. “When people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks Cramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said: “But when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?” He added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump’s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a “no-win situation” for Powell. As if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed’s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending. “The exhausting bottom line: Look it’s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don’t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A construction crew operating a hydraulic shovel during a nighttime project. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50 Ahead of Caterpillar Inc.’s (NYSE:CAT) announcement of its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results on January 30, Cramer said: “Thursday morning starts with Caterpillar, which is a conference call stock, meaning you can't make a decision until you hear the call because that's where you learn about the future. I think the stock's had an amazing run, but CAT’s no longer a cyclical, it's a secular grower because CEO, Jim Umpleby has maneuvered its business into more consistent end markets.” Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a leading global manufacturer and seller of heavy machinery and equipment, focusing on industries like construction, mining, and transportation. Previously, Cramer has called CAT a “Great Fed rate cut stock”. On January 13, analysts at financial services firm Evercore ISI upgraded the company stock from an Underperform rating to In Line following a survey of dealers in the construction equipment and heavy machinery sectors. David Raso, managing director and analyst at Evercore ISI, noted in a January 12 report that "Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is somewhat relying on price to move equipment, but it’s generally working." He added that Caterpillar dealers' six-month sales and purchasing forecasts are above the industry survey’s average. Additionally, Evercore ISI found that while new inventory remains above the industry average, it is gradually declining. However, used inventory has increased, which they attribute to weaker pricing for both new and used equipment compared to the industry survey’s average. Overall CAT ranks 10th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of CAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

January 28, 2025 22:10 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege the pharmaceutical giant misled them about the prospects of its experimental obesity drug, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and captioned Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, accuses the company and certain top executives of securities violations related to disclosures about the drug’s Phase 3 trial, dubbed REDEFINE-1. The plaintiffs, representing investors who purchased Novo Nordisk securities between Nov. 2, 2022, and Dec. 19, 2024, claim the company misrepresented the likelihood of CagriSema achieving at least 25% weight loss in the study. The suit alleges that Novo Nordisk created a “false impression” of reliable data supporting this projection, while downplaying concerns about dosage tolerability. Specifically, the lawsuit contends that the company’s “repeated optimistic claims” about CagriSema’s potential fell short of reality. It further argues that the trial’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, hampered the study’s ability to accurately assess weight loss at the tested dosage. This, the suit suggests, indicates either worse-than-anticipated tolerability, forcing patients to lower their doses, or a rushed patient selection process that included individuals not aiming for the targeted 25% weight loss. The complaint highlights the company’s December 20, 2024, announcement of headline results from the REDEFINE-1 trial. The disclosure revealed that the study utilized a flexible dosing protocol and that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of patients on CagriSema were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the other drugs being compared. Following this announcement, Novo Nordisk’s stock price dropped nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue this decline demonstrates the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the complaint’s allegations. “We’re examining whether Novo Nordisk may have intentionally misled investors about the trial’s design and potential tolerability issues,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Title: Taiwan may offer help for industry over Trump tariff threats

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's government will soon look at whether it needs to help its domestic industry over threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to put tariffs on semiconductors, Premier Cho Jung-tai said on Wednesday. Home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the island is a key link in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple and Nvidia. Trump said on Monday he plans to impose tariffs on imported chips, pharmaceuticals and steel to get the producers to make them in the United States. Responding to a question on Trump's remarks, Cho said the economy ministry and other departments have been paying close attention to the "developments of the past few days". "In a day or two we will urgently look at whether we need to make more cooperative plans and future assistance programmes for the industrial sector," he added. "I would like to reassure our compatriots that Taiwan's position in the world's industrial chain is not to be ignored, and that we will continue to maintain such an advantage." Taiwan has to continue to strive for more cooperation externally and to maintain its leadership in the industrial and technological sectors, Cho added. In 2020, under the first Trump administration, TSMC announced that it would build a $12 billion factory in Arizona in a win for efforts by the U.S. government to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China. It later boosted those plans with the total investment now standing at $65 billion. TSMC has declined to comment on Trump's latest tariff remarks. This month, Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said he only expected a small impact from any tariffs imposed by Trump on semiconductor exports given their technological superiority. In another potential challenge for Taiwan, Trump last week directed federal agencies to investigate persistent U.S. trade deficits and unfair trade practices and alleged currency manipulation by other countries. Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States surged 83% last year compared with 2023, with exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors.

Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz (NASDAQ:KSPI) Class Period: January 19, 2024 - September 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 18, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz continued doing business with Russian entities, and also providing services to Russian citizens, after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thereby exposing the Company to the undisclosed risk of sanctions; (2) the Company engaged in undisclosed related party transactions; (3) certain of the Company’s executives have links to reputed criminals; and (4) as a result, defendants’ statements about Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Kaspi class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/KSPI Sun Communities (NYSE: SUI) Class Period: February 28, 2019 - September 24, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that defendants provided investors with material information concerning SUI’s accounting practices and internal control over financial reporting. On September 24, 2024, after market close, an investment research report emerged calling into question the integrity of SUI’s Board and the integrity of the Company’s governance, controls, and financial disclosures. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to SUI’s revelation. The price of SUI’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $139.10 per share on September 24, 2024, SUI’s stock price fell to a low of $137.48 per share on September 25, 2024. For more information on the Sun Communities class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SUI Cassava Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ: SAVA) Class Period: February 7, 2024 - November 24, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that defendants provided investors with material information concerning Cassava’s leading drug candidate, simufilam. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, clear confidence in simufilam’s ability to treat Alzheimer’s Disease. On November 25, 2024, Cassava released topline results for the first of its two ongoing Phase 3 studies on simufilam, the “ReThink-ALZ” study. The results indicated that simufilam failed to meet each of the pre-specified primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints; in sum, simufilam failed to outperform the placebo. Following this news, the price of Cassava’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $26.48 per share on November 22, 2024, Cassava’s stock price fell to $4.30 per share on November 25, 2024, a decline of about 83.76% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Cassava class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SAVA MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGPI) Class Period: May 4, 2023 - October 30, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: February 14, 2025 MGPI is a manufacturer of hard liquors such as tequila, bourbon, rye, whiskey, vodka, and gin. MGPI sells the spirits it produces under its own brands as well as to other alcohol distributors and brands. Prior to the Class Period, sales of hard liquors, such as those produced and sold by MGPI, increased dramatically in the wake of COVID-19. However, as quarantines ended, sales of hard liquors slowed across the alcoholic beverage industry, and a backlog of inventory began to increase. The Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, MGPI falsely assured investors that its projections and statements accounted for the industry slowdown and that it was well-positioned to avoid a buildup of inventory. The Company also claimed that its projected sales took these industry trends into account. MGPI announced on October 17, 2024, that a slowdown in demand and an excess in inventories would undermine sales. This revelation caused the Company’s stock to plummet 29.5%. Then, less than two weeks later, on October 31, 2024, Defendants revealed that its excess inventory would have an even greater impact than previously reported. This caused the Company’s stock to drop another 14.7%, to a close of $49.04 per share on October 31, 2024. In total, MGPI’s share price declined nearly 50% on these two disclosures, wiping out hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization and damaging investors.

There is an expectation that the government may raise the basic exemption limit for personal income tax, with EY India suggesting an increase from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This move could enhance disposable income and stimulate economic growth. Investors are also hopeful for a more streamlined capital gains tax structure across various asset classes, which could reduce complexity and improve compliance. Deloitte anticipates that the government may introduce measures to simplify the tax structure, potentially facilitating smoother merger and acquisition deals. On the investment front, the government is expected to maintain a strong focus on infrastructure development, with previous budgets allocating a capital expenditure outlay of 11.1 trillion rupees for this purpose. Similar or increased allocations are anticipated, continuing to drive growth in sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Furthermore, with the global shift towards sustainability, there is an expectation for increased emphasis on renewable energy and green technologies. Incentives for green bonds or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments may also be introduced, aligning with global sustainability goals. For wealth management, these changes could necessitate adjustments in investment strategies to maintain tax efficiency, especially with potential modifications in income and capital gains taxes. The anticipated increased government spending in infrastructure and green energy sectors could also make related investment avenues more lucrative. As regulatory changes, particularly concerning mutual funds and other investment vehicles, are likely, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors will be crucial for navigating these shifts effectively. In summary, the upcoming budget is expected to introduce measures that could influence various aspects of wealth management, from tax planning to investment strategies. “The upcoming budget holds the promise of propelling India’s economy to greater heights in FY2025. With an immense focus on “Make in India” initiatives, an increasing regulatory oversight in the financial sector and a thriving global capability hub as key themes, the budget could further address issues faced by foreign companies doing business in India, attract investments for MSME entities and address inflationary pressures. By focusing on export competitiveness, sustainable infrastructure, and inclusive growth measures, the budget has the potential to strengthen India’s economic resilience and position it as a leader in the global economic landscape” The board has approved enhancement and combination of the previously approved fund-raising limit by way of nonconvertible debentures (“NCDs”) from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 11,000 crores, which are to be raised through public issue or private placement, or a mix thereof. It has also approved raising of funds for an amount not exceeding ₹5,000 crore via QIP.

The current 18% GST on these items discourages farmers from adopting advanced technologies vital for bridging the yield gap with developed nations. This high tax burden often forces farmers to rely on low-quality alternatives, leading to reduced productivity, lower incomes, and significant losses for the nation in terms of GDP and food security. Additionally, lowering the import duty on pesticide technicals and formulations continues to 10% making advanced innovative crop solutions more affordable and accessible. Encouraging domestic R&D through reinstating a 200% tax deduction on research expenses and allocating a dedicated budget for agrochemical innovation will foster self-reliance and reduce dependency on imports. We appreciate the various initiatives by the Hon’ble Agriculture Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, giving focus to the agriculture sector under the dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India’s agricultural research needs urgent attention. Only 0.06% of GDP is allocated to R&D, compared to 4.5-5% in developed nations, limiting our capacity to innovate. Reinstating the 200% tax incentive for R&D would encourage domestic innovation, reduce dependence on foreign technology, and ensure farmers benefit from cutting-edge solutions. The agrochemical industry, contributing USD 5.5 billion annually to India’s agricultural exports, is pivotal to strengthening agriculture. Strategic measures like tax incentives, a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a review of the Insecticides Act to streamline faster new product approvals will empower farmers, enhance productivity, and position India as a global leader in agriculture.” “As we approach the Union Budget for 2025, we anticipate a comprehensive and broad-based fiscal plan from the Modi government, marking its first full-fledged budget in this term. The government is expected to focus on continued infrastructure investment, particularly in critical areas such as housing, electricity, and employment generation. The targeted fiscal deficit is projected to be around 4.5% of GDP, reflecting the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst global uncertainties. While there may be discussions around potential relief for taxpayers, we do not anticipate any major changes in the overall tax structure in this budget. Instead, the focus will likely remain on enhancing capital expenditure and stimulating consumption to revitalize the economy, ultimately balancing support for growth initiatives with fiscal responsibility and setting a positive direction for India’s economy in the coming fiscal year.” “The Union Budget should focus on continuity in its policies—frequent changes can disrupt confidence and long-term planning. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 98% of the existing framework and communicate to the world about the consistency maintained. In fact, the Budget should focus on improving internal governance—diverting resources towards more impactful initiatives and eliminating redundant schemes. Necessary changes should be made wherever required with supporting rationale. This will also create a business-friendly environment, which is essential for India to attain its goal of Viksit Bharat. Streamlined regulations and a robust single-window clearance system can remove obstacles form industries, helping them utilise their full potential and drive economic expansion. High-tech manufacturing sectors, especially space, semiconductors, and chips, must form the core of this approach. Expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme beyond its current 14 sectors would further bolster India’s industrial base and enhance resilience against global disruptions. Agriculture is equally important and remains central to India’s economic fabric. Initiatives such as One District, One Warehouse, can minimise post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency, resulting in an increase in farmer incomes. By rationalising GST, reforming labour laws and incentivising green technologies, India can address the burgeoning issue of climate change while fostering resilience. These interconnected efforts, backed by public-private collaboration, can transform India into a future-ready, globally competitive economy.” Shares up 2.76% on the NSE to trade at ₹1,400.05 Radico Khaitan reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹95.49 crore as against ₹75.15 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year Datamatics Global Services reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹74.61 crore as against ₹41.41 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Orient Electric board has approved the payment of interim dividend of Rs 0.75 per equity share and fixed Tuesday, February 04, 2025, as the record date. Company reported its net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹27.17 crore as against ₹24.33 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Reducing the LTCG tax on equities from 12.5% to 10% would leave an additional 2.5% of gains in investors’ hands as investable capital. This surplus capital is likely to be reinvested in the market, enhancing liquidity and deepening market penetration. Similarly, reintroducing indexation benefits for debt mutual funds would ensure that investors are taxed only on real gains, making long-term investments in debt markets more attractive. These changes align with global best practices and can create a virtuous cycle—encouraging more retail and institutional participation, strengthening capital markets, and driving sustainable long-term growth. A stronger push for the vehicle scrappage policy could be a game-changer. Enhancing scrappage incentives to 8–10% of a new vehicle’s price and providing stronger benefits for electric vehicle (EVs) adoption would modernize India’s automotive landscape. Expanding scrapping facilities and automating fitness tests would make the process seamless. More importantly, linking scrappage with EV adoption would accelerate India’s transition to cleaner mobility while generating jobs in manufacturing and recycling. These measures mirror global best practices, such as Germany’s Umweltprämie and China’s EV incentives. This move not only reduces pollution but also boosts GST revenues—making it a win-win for both the economy and the environment. Lowering the GST rate on health and life insurance premiums from 18% to 5% would significantly reduce costs, making it more affordable and accessible. A lower GST rate would encourage more people across income levels to invest in health and life coverage. While there may be an initial reduction in GST collections per policy, the long-term impact could be much more positive—higher insurance penetration would offset revenue losses, while also reducing the financial burden on public healthcare infrastructure aligning with the government’s broader objective of strengthening social safety nets. Targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas, including rural housing under PMAY, health and wellness centres, and broadband expansion under BharatNet, would drive inclusive economic growth. Improved healthcare, digital access, and transport connectivity would uplift living standards, reduce poverty, and foster greater economic participation. For instance, extending housing and clean water access to marginalized communities would not only enhance quality of life but also stimulate local economies. Prioritizing such investments ensures equitable development, bridges regional disparities, and lays the foundation for sustainable growth, aligning with India’s broader economic and social objectives.

Sustained budgetary focus on varietal development can provide farmers with better and more climate-resilient options. This can be a great support to farmers for increasing yield by 15-40% from limited land resources. Agri infrastructure is a critical factor in the development of the sector. Last year a budget of INR 600 cr was allocated to AIF for promoting the creation of infrastructure at the farm and organisation level. The scheme should be promoted further with a larger budget to support micro infrastructure development not only in Agriculture but also in allied sectors such as dairy, fisheries, floriculture, beekeeping and medicinal plants. Further, schemes to promote digital agriculture should be promoted in the upcoming budget to enable seedless connectivity and data flow from producers to consumers. Digital infrastructure, supported by tools such as blockchain and IoT, can help farmers make better, informed decisions, create preparedness for nature’s unpredictability, and manage price fluctuations in the market.” CSB Bank reported an overall good set of numbers for the quarter ended December 2024. Here’s what stood out: In Q3 FY25, the banking sector has been impacted by liquidity tightness in the system, having a say on growth in deposits and consequentially the growth in advances. The system level growth in deposits was seen at 9.8 per cent year on year and the growth in advances at 11.2 per cent. However, CSB Bank was an exception. It’s business (deposits and advances) grew at over twice the system level growth, unlike some bigger banks. Deposits grew at 22.2 per cent and advances at 26.5 per cent year on year.

Especially considering that a retracement is usual after a sharp up move. Read full report here ‘’The world seems to be different in the last one week. DeepSeek has taken the world by storm over last couple of days – DeepSeek R1, dropped last week is already comparing with OPEN AI’s top models across math, code, and reasoning tasks and at fraction of costs!! The platform is open source, and the massive research is out there for anyone to threadbare! The way all the semi names have given up gains and corrected, difficult to say, that we are done yet there as uncertainty would continue to prevail over what the true demand would be for the chips, fabrication plants, energy, etc. There is likely to be some commentary from the Mega Cap names later this week – Apple, MSFT, TSLA, META, ASML, etc – hopefully, some clarity may emerge on what DeepSeek would eventually mean for Big Tech. INDIA during the week extended the sell off, with SMID indices draw down now approaching 15-18% - already the biggest drawdown since start of 2022. We would be favouring a sharp bounce here, given how oversold the momentum indicators are, but any sustained rally would require some direction from FM (Saturday Budget) and RBI (easing of lending norms, rate cut, etc). RBI has already initiated some announcements as regards unconventional easing – need to follow up with more of such announcements and rate cut perhaps in Feb. Liquidity Deficit has ballooned to INR 3.1trn, prompting RBI to announce slew of measures like: · OMO purchase of INR 600bn in 3 equal tranches · 6mth tenor USD/INR buy/sell swap of $5bn on Jan 31st · Longer tenor 56-day VRR of INR 500bn on Feb 7th to add durability to liquidity the measures announced could improve the system liquidity deficit to INR 2.4trn by end March, with core deficit likely around INR 1.0-1.2trn, implying that more measures are likely to be announced. Our economist suggests that these are unconventional easing mechanisms, and probably precursor to a likely monetary policy easing too in Feb !! Having lost around 3% of its value so far in the month, Nifty looks on track to end January on a negative note to mark the fourth consecutive month of correction — an exceptionally rare occurrence that hasn’t been reported in the last 23 years. Fed action, slew of reforms in the budget and liquidity easing by the central bank will set the tone for the markets in the coming 2-3 months. The FII’s have been sellers almost to the tune to ~ 1 bn USD even in Jan. Technically a push beyond 23200 will determine the future trend.’’ “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs. The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” Indian Bank reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹2,852.36 crore as against ₹2,119.35 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

The mood is still downbeat among participants with Q3 results from India Inc so far either on expected lines or below market expectations. The focus has now shifted to two major events - FOMC meeting scheduled tomorrow and Union Budget 2025 on February 1. The unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors and the bloodbath in the mid and small-cap segments is a cause for concern, investors said. Read more “With inflation showing no signs of abating within the Reserve Bank of India’s target range in the near future, I believe the finance minister will implement necessary policy measures to curb price increases. This could involve reducing taxes on consumer goods such as packaged food and edible oils. This would boost household disposable income and positively impact private consumption. Furthermore, I believe the Budget should include measures to encourage savings through tax rationalisation and stimulate loan growth. A separate announcement on developing future-proof digital infrastructure for the financial sector in the era of artificial intelligence is also anticipated,” “Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi, the Government of India has achieved significant milestones in housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Expanding the programme to include 2 crore additional rural houses and 1 crore urban houses by FY 2024-29 highlights the government’s dedication to uplifting marginalised communities. Further policy interventions, such as enhanced subsidies for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), can reduce financial barriers and improve access to quality housing. To advance the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All,’ incorporating affordable housing for EWS under Schedule VII of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provisions in The Companies Act will empower corporates entities and foundations to contribute to affordable housing initiatives. Encouraging public, private banks and financial institutions to prioritise affordable housing loans; introducing preferential interest rates and affordable repayment options (EMIs) for such loans will advance access to affordable housing. Additionally, blending CSR funds with government grants can address funding gaps. We advocate for a Public Private People Partnership (P4) model to foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. This will accelerate progress toward ‘Housing for All’ and support inclusive, sustainable development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” “The current tax framework, while serving its purpose, could benefit from greater flexibility to better support middle-class taxpayers, especially in areas like home loan interest deductions and investments under Section 80C. The ₹2,00,000 cap on home loan interest deductions for self-occupied properties, set in 2019, has not kept pace with inflation and rising property prices. As a result, many middle-class taxpayers may find it challenging to fully benefit from this deduction. Similarly, the Section 80C limit of ₹1,50,000, which has remained unchanged for almost a decade, may not be sufficient for salaried individuals, especially given that a significant portion of this limit is often absorbed by provident fund contributions, leaving limited room for other investments. To further support taxpayers, it would be beneficial to consider increasing the home loan interest deduction and revising the Section 80C limit to better reflect current economic conditions. Additionally, expanding these enhanced deductions, particularly under section 80C, to the new tax regime under Section 115BAC would offer more inclusivity, allowing taxpayers to benefit from lower tax rates while still having the flexibility to optimize their financial planning. This would not only ease financial burdens but also encourage homeownership, increase savings, and contribute to overall economic growth.” “The Union Budget 2025 is anticipated to prioritise India’s transition to a sustainable energy future by boosting investments in renewable energy infrastructure, green financing, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen. Measures to ease financial barriers to rooftop solar adoption, strengthen the National Solar Portal, and incentivise battery energy storage systems are expected to drive growth. Enhanced support for electric mobility and sustainable aviation fuels could further align India with its Net-Zero ambitions. Additionally, expanded tax incentives for green debt securities and clear policies for carbon markets are likely to attract investments, driving progress towards achieving India’s renewable energy capacity target and Net Zero target”. “The Union Budget 2025 holds immense significance for India’s manufacturing sector as the country strives to achieve its $2 trillion export target by 2030. To enhance global competitiveness, we expect measures such as tariff rationalization, duty exemptions, and expanded remission schemes to lower production costs and boost exports. Simplifying compliance procedures is also crucial to streamline operations and attract greater foreign investments. Targeted incentives for high-value manufacturing sectors like electronics and precision machinery, alongside support for labour-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and food processing, can drive rural development and create widespread employment. Additionally, fostering innovation by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as AI, digital twins, and 3D printing will position India as a hub for advanced manufacturing. We hope the budget introduces a visionary roadmap that propels the sector toward sustainability, agility, and leadership in global supply chains, fuelling inclusive economic growth” “The transport and logistics industry needs continued support from the government. To support the transport and logistics industry, TDS exemptions should be reconsidered given the low-margin nature of the business (3-4%) and long payment cycles. While exemptions exist for owners with fewer than 10 vehicles, customers still deduct TDS fearing non-compliance. Faster depreciation for EV trucks is essential to encourage adoption, alongside fiscal benefits to develop EV fast-charging infrastructure on highways to address range anxiety and save drivers’ time. A comprehensive fiscal policy, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, is needed to promote LNG trucks, ensuring cleaner logistics and lower costs. Additionally, the GST process must be more transparent and faceless for efficiency.” “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritize skill development and job creation to tap into India’s demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes. While the challenge of inflation, particularly food inflation continues to remain a concern, there is a need to implement robust supply-side measures to reduce the pain. We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivize production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics. Additionally, the government will emphasize healthcare, education, and skills development, while also promoting innovative technologies for inclusivity, formalization, and transparent governance. As India aims to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047, sustained investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure will be crucial for future growth.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

Stock traded at ₹365.10 on the NSE, lower by 7.74%. As India anticipates the Union Budget 2025-26, several expectations have emerged that could significantly impact wealth management strategies. There is an expectation that the government may raise the basic exemption limit for personal income tax, with EY India suggesting an increase from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This move could enhance disposable income and stimulate economic growth. Investors are also hopeful for a more streamlined capital gains tax structure across various asset classes, which could reduce complexity and improve compliance. Deloitte anticipates that the government may introduce measures to simplify the tax structure, potentially facilitating smoother merger and acquisition deals. On the investment front, the government is expected to maintain a strong focus on infrastructure development, with previous budgets allocating a capital expenditure outlay of 11.1 trillion rupees for this purpose. Similar or increased allocations are anticipated, continuing to drive growth in sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Furthermore, with the global shift towards sustainability, there is an expectation for increased emphasis on renewable energy and green technologies. Incentives for green bonds or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments may also be introduced, aligning with global sustainability goals. For wealth management, these changes could necessitate adjustments in investment strategies to maintain tax efficiency, especially with potential modifications in income and capital gains taxes. The anticipated increased government spending in infrastructure and green energy sectors could also make related investment avenues more lucrative. As regulatory changes, particularly concerning mutual funds and other investment vehicles, are likely, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors will be crucial for navigating these shifts effectively. In summary, the upcoming budget is expected to introduce measures that could influence various aspects of wealth management, from tax planning to investment strategies. “The upcoming budget holds the promise of propelling India’s economy to greater heights in FY2025. With an immense focus on “Make in India” initiatives, an increasing regulatory oversight in the financial sector and a thriving global capability hub as key themes, the budget could further address issues faced by foreign companies doing business in India, attract investments for MSME entities and address inflationary pressures. By focusing on export competitiveness, sustainable infrastructure, and inclusive growth measures, the budget has the potential to strengthen India’s economic resilience and position it as a leader in the global economic landscape” The board has approved enhancement and combination of the previously approved fund-raising limit by way of nonconvertible debentures (“NCDs”) from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 11,000 crores, which are to be raised through public issue or private placement, or a mix thereof. It has also approved raising of funds for an amount not exceeding ₹5,000 crore via QIP. Shares traded at ₹523.55 on the NSE, higher by 5.30% WhatsApp Image 2025-01-27 at 15.02.34_a6c1e5bf.jpg The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 51, and those that hit a 52-week low was 144. A total of 304 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 257 in the lower circuit. “To empower Indian farmers and accelerate agricultural growth, we anticipate exempting essential agricultural inputs such as agrochemicals, drones, and modern implements from GST or reducing the rate to a maximum of 5%. The current 18% GST on these items discourages farmers from adopting advanced technologies vital for bridging the yield gap with developed nations. This high tax burden often forces farmers to rely on low-quality alternatives, leading to reduced productivity, lower incomes, and significant losses for the nation in terms of GDP and food security. Additionally, lowering the import duty on pesticide technicals and formulations continues to 10% making advanced innovative crop solutions more affordable and accessible. Encouraging domestic R&D through reinstating a 200% tax deduction on research expenses and allocating a dedicated budget for agrochemical innovation will foster self-reliance and reduce dependency on imports. We appreciate the various initiatives by the Hon’ble Agriculture Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, giving focus to the agriculture sector under the dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India’s agricultural research needs urgent attention. Only 0.06% of GDP is allocated to R&D, compared to 4.5-5% in developed nations, limiting our capacity to innovate. Reinstating the 200% tax incentive for R&D would encourage domestic innovation, reduce dependence on foreign technology, and ensure farmers benefit from cutting-edge solutions. The agrochemical industry, contributing USD 5.5 billion annually to India’s agricultural exports, is pivotal to strengthening agriculture. Strategic measures like tax incentives, a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a review of the Insecticides Act to streamline faster new product approvals will empower farmers, enhance productivity, and position India as a global leader in agriculture.” “As we approach the Union Budget for 2025, we anticipate a comprehensive and broad-based fiscal plan from the Modi government, marking its first full-fledged budget in this term. The government is expected to focus on continued infrastructure investment, particularly in critical areas such as housing, electricity, and employment generation. The targeted fiscal deficit is projected to be around 4.5% of GDP, reflecting the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst global uncertainties. While there may be discussions around potential relief for taxpayers, we do not anticipate any major changes in the overall tax structure in this budget. Instead, the focus will likely remain on enhancing capital expenditure and stimulating consumption to revitalize the economy, ultimately balancing support for growth initiatives with fiscal responsibility and setting a positive direction for India’s economy in the coming fiscal year.” “The Union Budget should focus on continuity in its policies—frequent changes can disrupt confidence and long-term planning. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 98% of the existing framework and communicate to the world about the consistency maintained. In fact, the Budget should focus on improving internal governance—diverting resources towards more impactful initiatives and eliminating redundant schemes. Necessary changes should be made wherever required with supporting rationale. This will also create a business-friendly environment, which is essential for India to attain its goal of Viksit Bharat. Streamlined regulations and a robust single-window clearance system can remove obstacles form industries, helping them utilise their full potential and drive economic expansion. High-tech manufacturing sectors, especially space, semiconductors, and chips, must form the core of this approach. Expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme beyond its current 14 sectors would further bolster India’s industrial base and enhance resilience against global disruptions. Agriculture is equally important and remains central to India’s economic fabric. Initiatives such as One District, One Warehouse, can minimise post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency, resulting in an increase in farmer incomes. By rationalising GST, reforming labour laws and incentivising green technologies, India can address the burgeoning issue of climate change while fostering resilience. These interconnected efforts, backed by public-private collaboration, can transform India into a future-ready, globally competitive economy.” Shares up 2.76% on the NSE to trade at ₹1,400.05 Radico Khaitan reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹95.49 crore as against ₹75.15 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year Datamatics Global Services reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹74.61 crore as against ₹41.41 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Orient Electric board has approved the payment of interim dividend of Rs 0.75 per equity share and fixed Tuesday, February 04, 2025, as the record date. Company reported its net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹27.17 crore as against ₹24.33 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Reducing the LTCG tax on equities from 12.5% to 10% would leave an additional 2.5% of gains in investors’ hands as investable capital. This surplus capital is likely to be reinvested in the market, enhancing liquidity and deepening market penetration. Similarly, reintroducing indexation benefits for debt mutual funds would ensure that investors are taxed only on real gains, making long-term investments in debt markets more attractive. These changes align with global best practices and can create a virtuous cycle—encouraging more retail and institutional participation, strengthening capital markets, and driving sustainable long-term growth. A stronger push for the vehicle scrappage policy could be a game-changer. Enhancing scrappage incentives to 8–10% of a new vehicle’s price and providing stronger benefits for electric vehicle (EVs) adoption would modernize India’s automotive landscape. Expanding scrapping facilities and automating fitness tests would make the process seamless. More importantly, linking scrappage with EV adoption would accelerate India’s transition to cleaner mobility while generating jobs in manufacturing and recycling. These measures mirror global best practices, such as Germany’s Umweltprämie and China’s EV incentives. This move not only reduces pollution but also boosts GST revenues—making it a win-win for both the economy and the environment. Lowering the GST rate on health and life insurance premiums from 18% to 5% would significantly reduce costs, making it more affordable and accessible. A lower GST rate would encourage more people across income levels to invest in health and life coverage. While there may be an initial reduction in GST collections per policy, the long-term impact could be much more positive—higher insurance penetration would offset revenue losses, while also reducing the financial burden on public healthcare infrastructure aligning with the government’s broader objective of strengthening social safety nets. Targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas, including rural housing under PMAY, health and wellness centres, and broadband expansion under BharatNet, would drive inclusive economic growth. Improved healthcare, digital access, and transport connectivity would uplift living standards, reduce poverty, and foster greater economic participation. For instance, extending housing and clean water access to marginalized communities would not only enhance quality of life but also stimulate local economies. Prioritizing such investments ensures equitable development, bridges regional disparities, and lays the foundation for sustainable growth, aligning with India’s broader economic and social objectives. Craftsman Automation’s consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 declined to ₹12.93 crore as against ₹81.47 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corporation reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹253.09 crore as against ₹60.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Teamlease Services Limited reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹28.37 crore as against ₹31.12 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹124.10 crore as against ₹88.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. CAMS stock gained 3.71% on the NSE to ₹3,858.55 Maruti Suzuki India’s consolidated net profit increased by 16 per cent to ₹3,727 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024, as against ₹3,207 crore in the October-December period of last fiscal. Ambuja Cements (ACL), an Adani Group company, is expected to report a top-line in the range of ₹8,022 crore to ₹9,076 crore in the December quarter, according to estimates from top stock broking firms. While Yes Securities sees a 1.3 per cent year-on-year decline in ACL’s Q3FY25 revenue, Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates a jump of up to 12 per cent jump. Net profit is expected to be in the range of ₹74 crore to ₹1,022 crore, representing a decline of 6 per cent to 32 per cent in net profit. Read full report here “Indian agriculture needs to be supported by strong research for the development of resilient seeds for better adoption to climatic changes. Sustained budgetary focus on varietal development can provide farmers with better and more climate-resilient options. This can be a great support to farmers for increasing yield by 15-40% from limited land resources. Agri infrastructure is a critical factor in the development of the sector. Last year a budget of INR 600 cr was allocated to AIF for promoting the creation of infrastructure at the farm and organisation level. The scheme should be promoted further with a larger budget to support micro infrastructure development not only in Agriculture but also in allied sectors such as dairy, fisheries, floriculture, beekeeping and medicinal plants. Further, schemes to promote digital agriculture should be promoted in the upcoming budget to enable seedless connectivity and data flow from producers to consumers. Digital infrastructure, supported by tools such as blockchain and IoT, can help farmers make better, informed decisions, create preparedness for nature’s unpredictability, and manage price fluctuations in the market.” CSB Bank reported an overall good set of numbers for the quarter ended December 2024. Here’s what stood out: In Q3 FY25, the banking sector has been impacted by liquidity tightness in the system, having a say on growth in deposits and consequentially the growth in advances. The system level growth in deposits was seen at 9.8 per cent year on year and the growth in advances at 11.2 per cent. However, CSB Bank was an exception. It’s business (deposits and advances) grew at over twice the system level growth, unlike some bigger banks. Deposits grew at 22.2 per cent and advances at 26.5 per cent year on year. Read full report here Aluminium futures broke out of a range and marked a 11-quarter high last week. The continuous contract marked a high of ₹256.45 on January 20. But then the price started to moderate. On Tuesday (January 28), aluminium futures (February) closed at ₹247.35. Although the price has dropped, we cannot really call it a trend reversal. Especially considering that a retracement is usual after a sharp up move. Read full report here ‘’The world seems to be different in the last one week. DeepSeek has taken the world by storm over last couple of days – DeepSeek R1, dropped last week is already comparing with OPEN AI’s top models across math, code, and reasoning tasks and at fraction of costs!! The platform is open source, and the massive research is out there for anyone to threadbare! The way all the semi names have given up gains and corrected, difficult to say, that we are done yet there as uncertainty would continue to prevail over what the true demand would be for the chips, fabrication plants, energy, etc. There is likely to be some commentary from the Mega Cap names later this week – Apple, MSFT, TSLA, META, ASML, etc – hopefully, some clarity may emerge on what DeepSeek would eventually mean for Big Tech. INDIA during the week extended the sell off, with SMID indices draw down now approaching 15-18% - already the biggest drawdown since start of 2022. We would be favouring a sharp bounce here, given how oversold the momentum indicators are, but any sustained rally would require some direction from FM (Saturday Budget) and RBI (easing of lending norms, rate cut, etc). RBI has already initiated some announcements as regards unconventional easing – need to follow up with more of such announcements and rate cut perhaps in Feb. Liquidity Deficit has ballooned to INR 3.1trn, prompting RBI to announce slew of measures like: · OMO purchase of INR 600bn in 3 equal tranches · 6mth tenor USD/INR buy/sell swap of $5bn on Jan 31st · Longer tenor 56-day VRR of INR 500bn on Feb 7th to add durability to liquidity the measures announced could improve the system liquidity deficit to INR 2.4trn by end March, with core deficit likely around INR 1.0-1.2trn, implying that more measures are likely to be announced. Our economist suggests that these are unconventional easing mechanisms, and probably precursor to a likely monetary policy easing too in Feb !! Having lost around 3% of its value so far in the month, Nifty looks on track to end January on a negative note to mark the fourth consecutive month of correction — an exceptionally rare occurrence that hasn’t been reported in the last 23 years. Fed action, slew of reforms in the budget and liquidity easing by the central bank will set the tone for the markets in the coming 2-3 months. The FII’s have been sellers almost to the tune to ~ 1 bn USD even in Jan. Technically a push beyond 23200 will determine the future trend.’’ “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs. The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” Indian Bank reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹2,852.36 crore as against ₹2,119.35 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Gujarat Fluorochemicals’ consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹126 crore as against ₹80 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

Augmont, India’s largest gold trading platform, announced that it has added Lab Grown Diamonds (LGD) to its existing online SPOT trading platform for precious metals catering to more than 5,000 jewellers across the country. The enhanced SPOT 2.0 platform brings Augmont’s 17 years of precious metals trading expertise to the growing LGD sector. This addition represents an evolution of diamond trading infrastructure, particularly as India maintains its position as the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing destination. The platform enhancement introduces transparent pricing mechanisms and streamlined procurement processes for the LGD market inspiring confidence among key stakeholders. This strategic move is set to streamline the procurement for jewellers while establishing a transparent and efficient pricing mechanism for the rapidly growing LGD market in India. Mr. Ketan Kothari, Director of Augmont Group, said, “Augmont has firmly established itself as India’s go-to destination for buying and selling gold. Building on this strong foundation, we are proud to have our own lab-grown diamond (LGD) platform on Augmont SPOT, addressing the surging demand in this rapidly growing industry. The platform will enable market pricing and delivery of these diamonds globally including USA, Europe, Gulf and East Asia’’ Mr. Aarav Bafna, Product Head (LGD), Augmont, said, “With the extended version of SPOT, we plan to set a benchmark for LGD pricing. The current LGD pricing model, based solely on discounts relative to mined diamonds, is fundamentally flawed and irrational. Augmont is here to transform that narrative. Just as we revolutionized gold trading and price discovery in India, we are now ready to redefine and reimagine the LGD market.” SPOT offers a comprehensive and unified trading experience, enabling jewellers to source all their manufacturing requirements—including gold, silver, platinum, lab-grown diamonds, precious metal alloys, precious stones, and other essential materials—through a single integrated online platform. It also features real-time price discovery powered by advanced algorithms and market mechanisms, ensuring transparent and fair pricing. Quality assurance is a priority, with certification and verification processes for all listed diamonds. Built upon Augmont’s proven 17-year-old trading infrastructure, SPOT ensures seamless integration for a reliable and efficient trading experience. The platform addresses the growing demand for lab-grown diamonds, which have gained significant market share due to their sustainable nature and competitive pricing. SPOT is expected to handle substantial trading volumes, reflecting India’s dominant position in the global LGD polishing industry. As per the Commerce Ministry’s data, India polishes almost 98% of all lab-grown diamonds in the world in 2022. As per the EY report, the demand for Lab-Grown Diamonds is rising across the world, and its global market size is growing at 8.64% CAGR to touch $39.3 billion by 2028. And the Indian lab-grown diamond jewellery market, which was valued at around $300 million in 2023, is set to increase to $1.2 billion by 2033.

The government can play a pivotal role by introducing policy frameworks that encourage innovation -such as tax incentives, streamlined regulatory approvals, and interest subvention schemes to ease capital access for operators. Integrating flex spaces into urban development projects, like smart cities, IT parks and transport hubs, will further bolster growth and establish them as a vital component of India’s economic infrastructure. At the same time, the private sector must rise to the challenge by delivering world-class, technology driven workspace solutions that cater to the evolving needs of businesses and professionals. Investments in sustainable practices, digital infrastructure like 5G and enhanced customer experiences will ensure long term viability and competitiveness.

The mood is still downbeat among participants with Q3 results from India Inc so far either on expected lines or below market expectations. The focus has now shifted to two major events - FOMC meeting scheduled tomorrow and Union Budget 2025 on February 1. The unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors and the bloodbath in the mid and small-cap segments is a cause for concern, investors said. Read more “With inflation showing no signs of abating within the Reserve Bank of India’s target range in the near future, I believe the finance minister will implement necessary policy measures to curb price increases. This could involve reducing taxes on consumer goods such as packaged food and edible oils. This would boost household disposable income and positively impact private consumption. Furthermore, I believe the Budget should include measures to encourage savings through tax rationalisation and stimulate loan growth. A separate announcement on developing future-proof digital infrastructure for the financial sector in the era of artificial intelligence is also anticipated,” “Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi, the Government of India has achieved significant milestones in housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Expanding the programme to include 2 crore additional rural houses and 1 crore urban houses by FY 2024-29 highlights the government’s dedication to uplifting marginalised communities. Further policy interventions, such as enhanced subsidies for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), can reduce financial barriers and improve access to quality housing. To advance the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All,’ incorporating affordable housing for EWS under Schedule VII of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provisions in The Companies Act will empower corporates entities and foundations to contribute to affordable housing initiatives. Encouraging public, private banks and financial institutions to prioritise affordable housing loans; introducing preferential interest rates and affordable repayment options (EMIs) for such loans will advance access to affordable housing. Additionally, blending CSR funds with government grants can address funding gaps. We advocate for a Public Private People Partnership (P4) model to foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. This will accelerate progress toward ‘Housing for All’ and support inclusive, sustainable development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” “The current tax framework, while serving its purpose, could benefit from greater flexibility to better support middle-class taxpayers, especially in areas like home loan interest deductions and investments under Section 80C. The ₹2,00,000 cap on home loan interest deductions for self-occupied properties, set in 2019, has not kept pace with inflation and rising property prices. As a result, many middle-class taxpayers may find it challenging to fully benefit from this deduction. Similarly, the Section 80C limit of ₹1,50,000, which has remained unchanged for almost a decade, may not be sufficient for salaried individuals, especially given that a significant portion of this limit is often absorbed by provident fund contributions, leaving limited room for other investments. To further support taxpayers, it would be beneficial to consider increasing the home loan interest deduction and revising the Section 80C limit to better reflect current economic conditions. Additionally, expanding these enhanced deductions, particularly under section 80C, to the new tax regime under Section 115BAC would offer more inclusivity, allowing taxpayers to benefit from lower tax rates while still having the flexibility to optimize their financial planning. This would not only ease financial burdens but also encourage homeownership, increase savings, and contribute to overall economic growth.” “The Union Budget 2025 is anticipated to prioritise India’s transition to a sustainable energy future by boosting investments in renewable energy infrastructure, green financing, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen. Measures to ease financial barriers to rooftop solar adoption, strengthen the National Solar Portal, and incentivise battery energy storage systems are expected to drive growth. Enhanced support for electric mobility and sustainable aviation fuels could further align India with its Net-Zero ambitions. Additionally, expanded tax incentives for green debt securities and clear policies for carbon markets are likely to attract investments, driving progress towards achieving India’s renewable energy capacity target and Net Zero target”. “The Union Budget 2025 holds immense significance for India’s manufacturing sector as the country strives to achieve its $2 trillion export target by 2030. To enhance global competitiveness, we expect measures such as tariff rationalization, duty exemptions, and expanded remission schemes to lower production costs and boost exports. Simplifying compliance procedures is also crucial to streamline operations and attract greater foreign investments. Targeted incentives for high-value manufacturing sectors like electronics and precision machinery, alongside support for labour-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and food processing, can drive rural development and create widespread employment. Additionally, fostering innovation by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as AI, digital twins, and 3D printing will position India as a hub for advanced manufacturing. We hope the budget introduces a visionary roadmap that propels the sector toward sustainability, agility, and leadership in global supply chains, fuelling inclusive economic growth” “The transport and logistics industry needs continued support from the government. To support the transport and logistics industry, TDS exemptions should be reconsidered given the low-margin nature of the business (3-4%) and long payment cycles. While exemptions exist for owners with fewer than 10 vehicles, customers still deduct TDS fearing non-compliance. Faster depreciation for EV trucks is essential to encourage adoption, alongside fiscal benefits to develop EV fast-charging infrastructure on highways to address range anxiety and save drivers’ time. A comprehensive fiscal policy, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, is needed to promote LNG trucks, ensuring cleaner logistics and lower costs. Additionally, the GST process must be more transparent and faceless for efficiency.” “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritize skill development and job creation to tap into India’s demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes. While the challenge of inflation, particularly food inflation continues to remain a concern, there is a need to implement robust supply-side measures to reduce the pain. We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivize production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics. Additionally, the government will emphasize healthcare, education, and skills development, while also promoting innovative technologies for inclusivity, formalization, and transparent governance. As India aims to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047, sustained investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure will be crucial for future growth.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

It has been oscillating in the range of ₹1,635-1,725. This week, the scrip declined, and it closed at ₹1,645.50 on Tuesday. Nevertheless, the broader trend has been bullish, and since it is now near the lower boundary of the range, there is a good chance for a rally to ₹1,725.
