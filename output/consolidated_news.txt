Don’t Give Me Your SaaS The software as a service (SaaS) business model has become synonymous with integration and interoperability. One SaaS business usually connects to other SaaS businesses. But not so much anymore, writes Keynes Digital Founder and CEO Dan Larkman at AdMonsters. Wall Street investors and venture capitalists jumped on the SaaS startup bandwagon in a big way. Investors like subscription revenue because it’s seen as more durable and reliable. The Trade Desk, which is not a SaaS company, is at the whims of fickle marketers and agencies. That’s why, when the market sours or things go south for a brand, it’s ad tech and marketing that gets hosed. Unlike a SaaS model, advertisers can easily dial those budgets back. However, Larkman notes, SaaS vendors may have seeded their own destruction. The model worked when the focus was on easy interoperability and the ecosystem. That meant companies had to really earn their SaaS checks. The new focus in SaaS land seems to be around creating switching costs that make it harder to drop a vendor, often by revoking some former interoperability or open data API. Weak Spot Spotify’s stock price dipped 10% on Tuesday after the company missed its earnings expectations for Q2 and dialed back revenue projections for 2025, CNBC reports. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek blamed the shortfall on the company’s late-blooming (or not-so-blooming) advertising business. While streaming media and social platform ads are booming, Spotify’s ad revenue saw only 5% yearly growth (from a relatively smaller base). Advertising lagged far behind Spotify’s overall revenue growth rate of 15%. “The one area that hasn’t yet met our expectations is our ads business,” Ek said. “We’ve simply been moving too slowly, and it’s taken longer than expected to see the improvements we initiated take hold.” Although Spotify has grown its monthly advertiser base by 40% YOY, it still has plenty of headroom in terms of programmatic and direct demand, says Co-President and Chief Business Officer Alex Norström. “With the heavy lifting on our ad tech largely complete, we’re now focused on driving adoption,” Norström says. The plan for driving demand includes more campaign automation and a continued emphasis on video. Spotify’s ad biz is also looking for new leadership. Global head of ad sales Lee Brown is taking on the CRO role at DoorDash, which was announced on Monday. Brown has “done great things for Spotify,” Norström told an investor. “But right now, we need to accelerate the transformation of this business.” We Like Sportz Sports programming is the driving force behind this year’s upfront cycle. On Tuesday, Disney announced that sports ad volume across its linear and addressable businesses will near $4 billion for the 2025-2026 season. Similarly, The Wrap recently reported that Fox earned $2 billion in sports-specific upfront revenue, excluding the World Cup; and although NBCU didn’t disclose specifics, it reportedly saw a 45% year-over-year increase in sports ad volume. Perhaps this might be why sports streamer Fubo, which hasn’t been doing so hot lately, decided to post its preliminary second quarter results in advance of its actual earnings date on August 8. The results, better than expected, come as Fubo’s merger with Disney’s Hulu + Live TV is pending. According to Deadline, the deal is likely to close sooner than anticipated. Even by Q4 this year. Total revenue for Q2 exceeded prior guidance in both North America ($365 million) and the rest of the world ($8 million), and the company is apparently on track to achieve its first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA.

Title: U.S. could resist COSCO inclusion in CK Hutchison port sale

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The proposed inclusion of Chinese shipping giant Cosco in Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison's contentious global ports sale is a potential win for Beijing in a strategic sector, but the deal is far from final and could face resistance from Washington, sources and analysts say. Since the deal was announced on March 4 to sell 43 of CK Hutchison's ports in 23 countries, including two along the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run shipping company MSC, it has sparked a firestorm of criticism from China. While the U.S. government might oppose the inclusion of state-run Cosco in the consortium over perceived geopolitical risks posed by Chinese influence, bringing in the shipping giant could provide a more level playing field rather than one company being dominant, said a person with knowledge of the deal. The complex deal would require approval from around 50 jurisdictions involved, and it would take at least two years for the process to be completed, sources and analysts said.

Title: No drama in Stockholm; Rare Earths and Trump's China shift; Beijing floods; Ok to say overcapacity, New Shaolin Temple Abbot

The US-China Stockholm talks have concluded. Both sides said they went well, without giving details. The Chinese side said they agreed on an extension, the US side said President Trump has to approve it when they brief him Wednesday. USTR head Jamieson Greer in comments after the meeting reiterated the importance of rare earths: We were there in the first purpose to confirm the implementation of what was agreed in London in terms of accelerating the flow of rare earth magnets from China to US companies and then were able to discuss further how to make sure that the entire US supply chain including those that go through third countries could be accelerated. Earlier Tuesday President Trump in a post to Truth Social expressed his frustration at recent media reports that he has softened on China: The bigger reason for the Trump Administration shift on China may be rare earth magnets, and this quote from the Financial Times’ Trump blocks Taiwan’s President Lai from New York stopover highlights the massive leverage Xi has created with rare earths: In addition to concerns about derailing a summit, some officials say the US needs to “hide and bide” with respect to China. The phrase — which was used by China’s former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping — is being invoked to explain that the rare earths leverage China has created over the US limits Washington’s ability to take tough actions against Beijing. Some Trump defenders are using this quote to argue Trump has no choice but to soften the US stance towards China. But if that is the case then he was really poorly served by Treasury Secretary Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick et al because they should not have been surprised that China had built up this leverage. Instead they went full bore ahead with bad information (remember Bessent saying China is playing with a pair of twos?) and a less robust hand than they realized and ended up making Trump look weak, while giving Xi a win he can tout domestically and to the rest of the world, as the leader who stood up to Trump and the US. Summary of today’s top items: 1. US-China Stockholm talks 2. At least 30 dead in Beijing flooding - The worst of the flooding around Beijing may be over, and so far the offial death toll is 30, with a number of people still missing. A retirement home in Miyun, Beijing was inundated. Officially everyone was rescued but there are rumors going around that not all residents with mobility issues got out. I hope those rumors are wrong. 3. New abbot for Shaolin Temple - Shi Yinle, abbot of the White Horse Temple in Luoyang, is the new abbot of Shaolin Temple, replacing the fallen Shi Yongxin. In May during his Henan inspection tour Xi visited the White Horse Temple and was shown with Shi Yinle. Was that visit also an “interview” for this new post? 4. Two Bank of China overseas executives in trouble - Jiang Xu, president of BOC’s Peru subsidiary, is an expert in factoring, Caixin noted in its exclusive article on the cases. I am speculating here, but given his expertise and experience in factoring, and the recent exit ban of the American Wells Fargo executive who built their international factoring business, is there possibly some large factoring mess we have not yet heard about? 5. It is OK to say “overcapacity” again - Caixin has a brutal article on the state of the PRC auto industry: For over a decade, Beijing nurtured its nascent NEV industry with generous subsidies, creating a gold rush. Many local governments, eager for investment and jobs, offered lavish incentives to attract automakers.“In many cases, carmakers didn’t have to pay a cent to build new production capacity,” said a person familiar with China’s auto policy planning. “Once production targets were agreed — say, an annual capacity of 200,000 units — the local government would fund the factory through its affiliated investment platforms.”After years of rapid expansion, most automakers are now mired in overcapacity. By May 2022, China’s passenger car inventory had already surpassed 3 million units, and it has remained above that level since, hitting a five-year high of 3.45 million units in May 2025. With too many factories chasing too few buyers, a price war was almost inevitable.Some local governments went even further, directing state capital to set up joint ventures or prop up underperforming companies, which has in some cases hampered the market’s ability to weed out the chaff and hindered consolidation. People paying attention knew this was the case, but media being this blunt about it feels like a bit of a shift, one that fits with the intensifying campaign talking up addressing “involution” and overcapacity. Thanks for reading. U.S. and China Fail to Reach Immediate Deal to Prolong Trade Truce - The New York Times Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, said that he would discuss the situation with his top advisers on Wednesday and “either approve it or not.” He appeared to indicate at one point that the talks between the United States and China had hit some unspecified roadblocks. “I said, ‘Oh, here we go again,’” Mr. Trump said, before adding, “Today it worked out.”..When pressed to name concessions the U.S. side achieved from the Chinese side, Mr. Greer cited China’s decision to grant U.S. companies licenses to rare earths.“They blocked all of their rare earth magnets, and now they are getting them,” Mr. Greer said.Mr. Greer also said tariff levels on some Chinese imports could snap back to above 80 percent if a truce was not extended by Aug. 12. But Mr. Bessent downplayed that possibility. Trump Tariffs: US, China Agree to Continue Talks on a Truce Extension - Bloomberg At issue in the ongoing dialog is how the two countries seek to maintain a stable trading relationship while applying barriers like tariffs and export controls to limit each other’s progress in critical sectors ranging from battery technology and defense to semiconductors.Greer said the US wants assurances that critical materials like magnets keep flowing so the two sides can focus on other priorities. “We don’t ever want to talk about magnets again,” he said.Greer said the resumption of China’s rare earths exports is Beijing’s biggest concession so far. Asked if the US made any commitments to China on its pending 232 investigations, Greer said China asked for status updates on them, but stressed that the eventual duties would be applied globally and not have any exemptions for particular countries. China, US trade talks in-depth, candid, constructive: China intl trade representative - Global Times The trade and economic teams of China and the United States held in-depth, candid and constructive exchanges over important topics of mutual interest, a senior Chinese official said in Sweden on Tuesday, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Li Chenggang, China international trade representative with the Ministry of Commerce and vice minister of commerce, made the remarks when briefing the press following the new round of economic and trade talks in Stockholm, per Xinhua.The two sides will continue pushing for the continued extension of the pause on 24 percent of reciprocal tariffs of the U.S. side, as well as counter measures of the Chinese side, said Li. Upholding sincerity, principles to advance China-U.S. economic, trade relations - People's Daily Zhong Sheng Differences between countries are inevitable; the key lies in how they are addressed. Dialogue and consultation provide not only a more efficient path forward, but also serve to forestall unnecessary costs. China's development interests must not be compromised. The two sides should explore possible solutions through dialogue based on mutual respect. Upholding the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation in economic and trade consultations aligns with the expectations of both peoples and the wider international community.Sincerity, however, does not imply compromising on principles. Consultations have bottom lines, and cooperation must be grounded in clear principles. Any dialogue must be conducted based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit.What China seeks to safeguard is not only its own legitimate rights and interests, but also international fairness and justice. China's development achievements are the result of the hard work of the Chinese people, not bestowed by others, nor achieved at the expense of other countries. These achievements must not be undermined, and China's right to development cannot be denied.In the face of U.S. tariff blackmail, investment restrictions, and technological blockades, China's determination to defend its legitimate rights and interests remains unwavering, and its capabilities are evident to all. China Minister Meets US Delegation Including Apple in Beijing - Bloomberg Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Lecheng discussed equipment machinery, intelligent manufacturing and business operations in China with the delegation led by US-China Business Council chair and FedEx Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Subramaniam, according to a government statement. In addition to Apple, executives from companies including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Otis Worldwide Corp. also attended the meeting, the statement said, without identifying the participants.During the meeting, Li reiterated that the ministry remains committed to upholding a fair and just market environment for foreign enterprises and encouraged more US companies to invest and participate in China’s industrialization. Related: Trump softens stance on China, amid trade talks and summit push - The Washington Post The moves include dissuading Taiwan’s leader from making planned stopovers in the United States next month, postponing a meeting between Taipei’s defense minister and top Pentagon leaders in June, and pausing new export controls on China, according to more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials and other people familiar with the actions… Lai isn’t the first senior Taiwanese official to see his U.S. trip canceled this year. Taiwanese Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo was scheduled to visit Washington in June for high-level meetings with Pentagon officials, including policy chief Elbridge Colby, according to two other people familiar with the situation. [As I noted in the Monday newsletter] Those meetings were abruptly canceled by the U.S. after Xi urged Trump to limit U.S. engagement with Taiwan during a phone call earlier in June, the two people said. Trump may not replace Biden-era AI rule | Semafor The Trump administration is easing off its tough-on-China approach to technology export controls as it searches for leverage in trade talks and looks to propel US dominance on artificial intelligence. The administration is debating whether to scrap its plans to replace a Biden-era rule that set up a global framework for export controls designed to prevent US-designed AI technology like chips from flowing to China or Russia, two industry sources told Semafor. That’s not the only sign of a less hawkish approach to AI policy; the administration’s new AI plan called for more open-source and open-weight models despite concerns that they could benefit Beijing. And US officials recently approved the sale of certain semiconductors produced by Nvidia to China, drawing bipartisan scrutiny on Capitol Hill. “I think it’s a mistake,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told Semafor of the administration’s approval of selling those chips. “Because all they’re doing is helping China. I just think it’s a huge mistake. And I’m not sure, I think some CEOs talked the president into it. I hope he turns out to be right, but I wouldn’t have done it.” In an era of global crises and polarization, journalism has a crucial role in bridging divides.

At least 30 killed as storms lash Beijing - Financial Times At least 30 people have been killed as heavy storms lashed Beijing, while authorities relocated tens of thousands of people from the region around the Chinese capital after almost a full season’s worth of rain fell overnight.More than 80,000 people have been moved following the storms, which caused significant damage in the mountainous areas north of Beijing, according to state broadcaster China Central Television.President Xi Jinping said on Monday that heavy rainfall had resulted in “significant casualties and property damage” in Beijing as well as China’s northern provinces of Hebei, Shandong and Jilin, according to state news agency Xinhua. Vice premier urges efforts to safeguard lives and property of people impacted by floods-Xinhua Zhang Guoqing arrived in Beijing's Miyun District on Monday evening to visit and console residents displaced by torrential rains, and to oversee on-site flood control and relief efforts.Zhang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, visited hospitals, temporary shelters and the Miyun Reservoir, entrusted with the task by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee.He conveyed Xi's concerns and learned about search-and-rescue operations, medical care, evacuations and flood-mitigation engineering work in detail. PLA, PAPF race to aid flood relief as torrential rains batter multiple regions in North China - Global Times The PAPF Beijing Corps has mobilized over 1,800 officers and soldiers to deliver supplies to Fengjiayu Township in Miyun district, evacuate residents from Mujiaoyu Township, reinforce embankments along the Chaohe River, and set up emergency shelters in Yanqi Township and Liuli Temple Township in Huairou district. As of press time, over 4,000 residents had been relocated, more than 2,000 boxes of emergency supplies delivered, and over 30,000 sandbags filled.On Monday evening, more than 500 officers and soldiers from the Beijing Garrison Command braved the rain to rush to the newly built Ningcun Bridge in Miyun district, where they worked overnight to reinforce the riverbank embankments. 中共中央组织部印发《关于在防汛抢险救灾中充分发挥基层党组织战斗堡垒作用和广大党员先锋模范作用的通知》 The Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee has issued a circular calling for the thorough implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions, with specific requirements to fully leverage the role of grassroots Party organizations as strongholds and the exemplary vanguard role of Party members in flood prevention, emergency rescue, and disaster relief efforts.中共中央组织部印发通知，就深入贯彻落实习近平总书记重要指示精神，在防汛抢险救灾中充分发挥基层党组织战斗堡垒作用和广大党员先锋模范作用提出要求。The circular emphasizes that leading officials at all levels must firmly uphold bottom-line and worst-case-scenario thinking, fully carry out their political responsibilities in flood prevention and disaster response, mobilize grassroots Party organizations and a broad range of Party members and cadres to earnestly fulfill all tasks related to flood control and emergency rescue. This includes promptly identifying and addressing potential dangers, decisively relocating and resettling threatened residents, and making every effort to ensure the safety of people’s lives and property.通知强调，各级领导干部要树牢底线思维、极限思维，全面落实防汛抢险救灾政治责任，广泛动员基层党组织和广大党员干部扎实做好防汛抢险救灾各项工作，及时排查处置险情，果断转移安置受威胁群众，全力保障人民生命财产安全。Party organization departments at all levels must assess and identify officials on the frontlines of flood prevention and disaster relief, encouraging Party members and cadres to take the lead, step up in times of need, and shoulder their responsibilities with courage and determination.各级党委组织部门要在防汛抢险救灾一线考察识别干部，激励广大党员干部冲锋在前、挺膺担当。 China releases US$77 million relief fund as casualties mount in Beijing floods | South China Morning Post A total of 550 million yuan (US$76.7 million) has been allocated by the central government to flood-hit regions for disaster relief, with 200 million yuan directed to Beijing’s response to the floods...From Thursday to midnight on Monday, the average rainfall in the capital was 165.9mm (6.5 inches), with the maximum recorded precipitation reaching 543.4mm (21.4 inches) – which qualifies as an extreme rainstorm, The Beijing News reported on Tuesday. Abbot of Luoyang’s White House Temple appointed as new abbot of Shaolin - Global Times Shi Yinle, abbot of the White Horse Temple in Luoyang, Central China's Henan Province, has reportedly assumed the position of abbot of the Shaolin Temple, according to a statement from the Shaolin Temple following the launch of an investigation into its former abbot.According to a release from the Shaolin Temple on Tuesday, in accordance with the regulations on the appointment of abbots in Chinese Buddhist Temples, and upon the democratic deliberation and approval by the monastic community of Shaolin Temple, Venerable Yinle has been ceremoniously invited to assume the position of abbot of Shaolin Temple following due procedures...Shi Yinle previously served as a delegate to the seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and held the position of deputy secretary-general of the Buddhist Association of Henan Province. 习近平在河南考察时强调：坚定信心推动高质量发展高效能治理 奋力谱写中原大地推进中国式现代化新篇章__中国政府网 Subsequently, Xi Jinping visited the White Horse Temple, which was first built during the Eastern Han Dynasty, to conduct an inspection. He gained a detailed understanding of the Sinicization of Buddhism and the protection of temple cultural relics. He pointed out that the White Horse Temple has witnessed the introduction, development, and continuous Sinicization of Buddhism. History has proven that adhering to the direction of the Sinicization of religion in China is entirely correct. It is necessary to actively guide religions to integrate with the outstanding traditional Chinese culture and adapt to socialist society.随后，习近平来到始建于东汉年间的白马寺考察，详细了解佛教中国化和寺院文物保护情况。他指出，白马寺见证了佛教传入、发展并不断中国化的进程。历史证明，坚持我国宗教中国化方向是完全正确的，要积极引导宗教同中华优秀传统文化相融合、与社会主义社会相适应。 Here he is with the new abbot of Shaolin Temple: China’s Shaolin Temple gets a new abbot after money, sex scandals fell Shi Yongxin | South China Morning Post The abbot of White Horse Temple, Shi Yinle, will replace him, according to a brief statement from the Shaolin Temple on Tuesday.“In accordance with the regulations on the appointment of abbots of Chinese Buddhist Temples, after democratic evaluation and approval by the Shaolin Temple and following the relevant procedures, Venerable Yinle was invited to be the abbot of the Shaolin Temple,” the one-paragraph statement said...On Tuesday, the heart of the complex – the fangzhang yuan – was found sealed off by green barriers on all sides. A sign posted outside the area, which serves as abbot’s reception courtyard, stated that this was for “cultural relic preservation”.A nearby stone stele, erected in 1999 to commemorate Shi’s leadership, had its inscription covered, its celebratory message obscured from view. Faith, Greed, and Power: The Unraveling of the Shaolin Kingdom - Caixin Before he formally took the reins in the mid-1990s, Shi’s strategy was clear: take the Shaolin brand to the world. Acknowledging the power of The Shaolin Temple movie, he saw that the temple’s connection to the outside world was its unique blend of Zen and martial arts. He founded the Shaolin Warrior Monk Troupe, which debuted to acclaim in 1989 and soon embarked on international tours, including a historic 1993 visit to Taiwan that marked the first cross-strait religious exchange in over four decades.His masterstroke came in 1995. Seizing on the temple’s 1,500th anniversary, the 30-year-old Shi organized a lavish, five-day celebration against the wishes of skeptical officials. In his memoir, he recounts his audacious lobbying campaign, which included tracking down the Henan provincial party secretary on an overnight train to Beijing to personally make his case during a two-hour pitch. The gamble worked. The festival drew thousands of guests from over 17 countries and was covered by hundreds of journalists. As a newly installed bell tolled for the first time in 60 years, Shi cemented his position as the temple’s undisputed leader.His political star rose in tandem. He became a delegate to the National People’s Congress and president of the Henan Buddhist Association. In August 1999, at the age of 34, Shi Yongxin was formally installed as the 30th abbot of the Shaolin Temple in a ceremony attended by top religious leaders and dozens of government officials. The boy who came to learn kung fu was now the master of China’s most famous monastery. He was ready to take it into the 21st century. Caixin Exclusive: Two Heads of Bank of China’s Overseas Arms Unreachable Two presidents at Bank of China Ltd.’s (BOC) overseas arms have become unreachable, with one detained by Chinese graft-busters, Caixin learned from sources with knowledge of the matter.While the exact reasons remain unclear, Jia Tianbing and Jiang Xu — presidents of BOC’s Macao branch and Peru subsidiary, respectively — are likely to have been ensnared in the country’s long-running crackdown on corruption in finance.The campaign has involved senior officials at the overseas offices of China’s “Big Four” state-owned commercial banks, including BOC and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (ICBC)...Industry insiders told Caixin that Jiang Xu is highly experienced in factoring, a type of financial service that can help businesses get cash quickly by selling their unpaid invoices to a bank. His track record in this vein included a stint at the Amsterdam-based Factors Chain International, a global association for the receivables finance industry. 中行境外机构地震 多名现任“一把手”失联_金融我闻_财新网 ‘Pervasive sense of fear’: China steps up exit bans as US tensions flare - Financial Times One person, who learned of their exit ban at airport customs, recalled that a “light turned red and a weird siren rang out”. An officer informed them of the ban and handed over a telephone number to call for more information. No one ever picked up, they said.An investor who was also stopped at the airport said his heart began to pound. “I desperately searched my memory for anything I could possibly have done wrong,” he said. “I was consumed with dread. Each day felt like a year.”Both individuals, who asked not to be named, said it took months to lift the bans, which were related to cases in which they were tangentially involved. The investor said his case stemmed from a financial dispute at a Chinese company of which he was a director...In the recent case of the US banker, China’s finance ministry said Chenyue Mao, a top trade finance banker at Wells Fargo, was “involved in a criminal case”, without elaborating.Wells Fargo’s China operations are limited, but Mao, a US citizen based in Atlanta, had over a decade-long career helped build up the group’s international factoring business, a service that allows domestic exporters to sell overseas account receivables at a slight discount for immediate cash.

Caixin In Depth: China’s Surging Auto Sales Mask an Industry in Crisis Over the past two and a half years, China’s auto industry has been gripped by a relentless price war amid a cycle of self-destructive hyper competition, termed “involution.” While price wars are a common feature of commercial competition, in China’s case, the price war has failed to achieve one of its supposed outcomes — accelerating industry consolidation. In fact, the market share of the 15 biggest automakers by sales shrank by 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 92.2%, according to CAAM...For over a decade, Beijing nurtured its nascent NEV industry with generous subsidies, creating a gold rush. Many local governments, eager for investment and jobs, offered lavish incentives to attract automakers.“In many cases, carmakers didn’t have to pay a cent to build new production capacity,” said a person familiar with China’s auto policy planning. “Once production targets were agreed — say, an annual capacity of 200,000 units — the local government would fund the factory through its affiliated investment platforms.”After years of rapid expansion, most automakers are now mired in overcapacity.

It is the first central SOE to be based in Chongqing and the 100th central SOE nationwide.Changan Auto completed its commercial registration on July 27, with a registered capital of CNY20 billion (USD2.8 billion), according to corporate data platform Qichacha. 多部门透露下半年工作重点：扩内需促消费 反内卷优供给 稳住楼市股市-上海证券报·中国证券网 In reviewing a recent flurry of high-level meetings in China, Shanghai Securities News has identified three key economic priorities in the latter half of this year: 1) increasing domestic demand and consumption; 2) boycotting “involution” and optimizing supply; 3) stabilizing the housing market. Analysts say that the expansion of domestic demand will still need to be supported by fiscal and monetary policy, including the use of ultra-long state bonds toward consumer trade-in programs. Others say efforts to revitalize urban development will also be another important tool to increase domestic demand. On “involution,” analysts say the focus will be the orderly phasing out of “backward industrial capacity,” and some called the anti involution efforts China’s “supply-side reform 2.0.” On housing, some experts predict that more measures — like further relaxation of restrictive rules in first-tier cities — will likely be rolled out in the latter half of the year. China Social Spending Hits Highest Level in Nearly Two Decades - Bloomberg While Beijing is channeling less on-budget investment into infrastructure, expenditure that covers outlays ranging from education to employment and social security climbed to nearly 5.7 trillion yuan ($795 billion) in the first half — the highest for the period since the data series began in 2007.

According to the data, economic expectations are heating up, with a notable shift in household consumption intentions.One key finding: around 30% of surveyed residents indicated plans to increase their spending on travel—reflecting growing consumer confidence and a potential rebound in the services and tourism sectors.In the survey on residents’ intentions regarding consumption, saving, and investment, in the second quarter, 63.8% of residents preferred “more saving,” 23.3% preferred “more consumption,” and 12.9% preferred “more investment.” The top five investment methods favored by residents were, in order: “non-principal-guaranteed wealth management products from banks,” “fund and trust products,” “stocks,” “bonds,” and “non-consumption insurance.” The proportion of residents choosing these five types of investments were 34.8%, 24.7%, 16.3%, 15.3%, and 9.8%, respectively. China is also Fighting a Trade War with Europe (and Winning) | Council on Foreign Relations Europe is clearly getting hit hard by China’s industrial policy successes—and now by a weak yuan. Its response has been inadequate. Time for Europe to step up with a counter industrial policy of its own and start to take the issues around China’s macroeconomic imbalances seriously. China struggles to break its addiction to manufacturing - Financial Times After previously denying the existence of overcapacity — Xi during a trip to France last year said there was no such thing — Qiushi, the Communist party magazine, last month not only used the term but also laid out a forensic analysis of its causes. A swath of measures to try to shore up prices have followed. But with China’s investment in manufacturing still rising at a blistering pace — up 7.5 per cent this year after a 9.5 per cent rise in 2024 — there is no end in sight. Yan Se, assistant professor in the department of applied economics at the Guanghua School of Management in Peking University, said at a recent seminar that China’s share of global manufacturing value-added could rise to 40 per cent in the next five years, from about 27 per cent now. “深学笃行阐释习近平经济思想2025年会”在京举办-新华网 In this pivotal year marking the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the strategic planning of the 15th Five-Year Plan, the “2025 Annual Conference on In-Depth Study and Interpretation of Xi Jinping Economic Thought” was held in Beijing on July 29.

In an altercation that was caught on video and took social media by storm, the man was shown smashing a reporter’s filming equipment to pieces.As the story turned on the perpetrator of the violent act, a 42-year old boss at Hunan Fengxu Cable Company (湖南豐旭線纜有限公司) identified only as Mr. Xie, the All-China Journalists Association (ACJA) — an ostensible professional association for the media that more fully represents the interests of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) — spoke out in support of the reporters. In a sanctimonious missive, the association declared that “interviewing is a journalist’s right” (采访是记者的权利). 李希：发扬彻底的自我革命精神 进一步把“三化”建设年行动向纵深推进————头条——中央纪委国家监委网站 The work promotion meeting for the “Year of Standardized, Legalized, and Regularized Development of Discipline Inspection and Supervision Work” was held in Beijing on July 29.

China urged to control narrative and engage Asia to counteract the West: ‘own the story’ | South China Morning Post Zheng Yongnian, a prominent political scientist, said China must take a leading role in shaping the “Asian narrative” with an open and inclusive mind, invite more Asian scholars to engage, seek common ground and promote dialogue to push back against an entrenched dominance of Western discourse.Asian values were rooted in the principle of “harmony and diversity” and the region should return to its tradition of consensus-based politics, he said in an interview published on July 17 by China International Communications Group (CICG) Asia-Pacific, a state-owned organisation operated by the Communist Party’s Central Propaganda Department.“For a long time, Western discourse held absolute dominance, and most Chinese scholars were educated within that framework. As a result, China had struggled to project its voice internationally. Today, that is beginning to change – but it will take time,” he said. China's police chief meets Interpol secretary general-Xinhua State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong met with Valdecy Urquiza, secretary general of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) here on Tuesday, calling for deepening cooperation in fields such as combating transnational crime.China firmly supports Interpol's leading role in the multilateral law enforcement frameworks, said Wang, adding that the Chinese side stands ready to work with the organization to implement the Global Security Initiative and ensure the success of the 94th Interpol General Assembly.Wang called on both sides to strengthen cooperation in areas such as cracking down on transnational crime and enhancing law enforcement capacity, in order to jointly build a community with a shared future for humanity that features universal security. U.S. military expands in Palau amid China's growing influence - The Washington Post The U.S. military will next year upgrade Palau’s main harbor, usually frequented by dive boats full of tourists heading to emerald lagoons, so that American warships can enter the Pacific island nation’s narrow channels and dock here...Complicating that plan, however, is a Chinese-owned hotel overlooking Malakal Harbor that U.S. and Palauan officials worry could be used for surveillance.Across Palau, Chinese businesses and developers have leased land near a half-dozen strategic locations where the United States is beefing up efforts to detect and deter China’s growing reach into the region, according to intelligence and security documents and interviews with 20 American, Palauan and Taiwanese officials. Beijing bolsters its position in the Indo-Pacific with little US pushback | Brookings While the Trump administration has been preoccupied with its trade war with Beijing, Beijing has adopted a two-pronged approach to bolster its own position in the Indo-Pacific region: pushing harder against those in the region that challenge China’s sovereignty claims, while pulling its stalwart partners and so-called swing states closer into its orbit. China has been steadily advancing its territorial claims along its periphery without eliciting much discernible pushback from the Trump administration. As Brookings scholar Lynn Kuok has noted, China in April “made its first on-the-ground, formal assertion of sovereignty over a previously unoccupied land feature in the South China Sea in more than a decade.” Meanwhile, Beijing has continued to ramp up pressure on Taiwan—most notably during its Strait Thunder-2025A exercise in April. These activities are likely designed to establish a “new normal” for Beijing’s coercive activities during the Trump administration. Simultaneously, China has pursued a “charm offensive” with friendly countries and so-called swing states in Southeast Asia.From Beijing’s perspective, there are a number of compelling reasons to pursue this two-pronged strategy. President Donald Trump and his top foreign policy officials are utterly distracted by their multifront trade war, strikes on Iran, and their quixotic efforts to resolve the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The dearth of bandwidth at the top is compounded by the lack of staffing to address Beijing’s subtle salami slicing. Moreover, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his European Union counterpart in July that Beijing was worried that the United States would turn its full attention to China and the Indo-Pacific after the end of the Ukraine war, an assessment that would only give additional impetus to Beijing to consolidate its position in the region sooner rather than later.Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s punitive and erratic tariff policy provides an opening for China to make headway with countries in the region at very little cost. Three terrorists who masterminded attack on Chinese engineers in Karachi in Nov killed in Pakistan counterterrorism operation: media - Global Times Three terrorists, including the mastermind behind the November 2024 attack on Chinese engineers, were killed during a counterterrorism operation in Karachi city in Pakistan, said Pakistan officials as reported by the Dawn. “A terrorist who masterminded an attack on Chinese engineers in November last year has been killed during an operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area,” said Additional Inspector-General of Police, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Azad Khan, per the Dawn.

China’s J-20 stealth aircraft flew through the Tsushima Strait. Did anybody else notice? | South China Morning Post The Chinese air force’s most advanced J-20 stealth fighter has flown through the strategic Tsushima Strait near Japan, an apparent first not reported by any other armed forces with a presence in the region.In a series aired on Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV reported that the elite air force unit, the First Fighter Brigade, now “flies missions over the Bashi Channel and Tsushima Strait, and conducts patrols around Taiwan”. The unit was among the first to receive the new-generation aircraft and while the report did not refer to the J-20 directly, footage of the stealth fighter was shown throughout the segment, leaving little doubt about the aircraft involved. China says new Mazu weather warning AI will help developing nations prepare for disaster | South China Morning Post Mazu is one of the most revered Chinese deities in Southeast Asia, sometimes conflated with the Virgin Mary. The Multi-hazard Alert Zero-gap and Universal (Mazu) system was purpose-built for global reach, according to China’s national weather service. The initiative, which was unveiled at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on Saturday, is expected to support partner countries under China’s Belt and Road Initiative by introducing critical early warning capabilities. Battle to uphold correct view of history continues after long-ended WWII - China Military The distortion of WWII history is no longer a purely academic debate or a so-called difference in memory, but has become a deliberate manipulation serving today's geopolitical struggles. For example, certain forces in the US and Europe are trying to erase the Soviet Union's significant contribution and immense sacrifices in defeating Nazi Germany, even going so far as to rewrite WWII history and whitewash Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators. The West's selective memory of WWII has become a tool for geopolitical rivalry, amounting to an act of arrogance and betrayal against historical truth.For some time now, mainstream Western discourse has fallen into a Normandy-centered narrative trap when commemorating the WWII. Certain voices highlight the D-Day landings as the decisive turning point of the anti-fascist war, while deliberately downplaying or ignoring the decisive contributions made on other fronts. The ironclad fact that the Soviet Union sacrificed 27 million lives and countless wounded on the Eastern Front is now marginalized as a mere "footnote" under today's Western "political correctness."In the East, right-wing forces in Japan still refuse to face up to their history of aggression, repeatedly attempting to whitewash the militarist invasions of the past, which continues to raise alarm among neighbouring Asian countries and their people. If, in the case of the European theatre, the West's historical manipulation often takes the form of distortion and "reinvention", then when it comes to the Eastern, they tend to simply look the other way, or even tolerate Japan's flawed historical perception out of the pragmatic need to win it over politically. The Chinese people, through the bloody war of resistance, pinned down and destroyed the vast majority of the Japanese militarist army's main forces. At the cost of more than 35 million lives lost and wounded, China made a decisive contribution to the final victory on the Eastern battlefield of the World Anti-Fascist War. Without the Chinese people's determined resistance, the history of Asia, and even the world, could well have been rewritten. Taiwan foreign ministry denies Financial Times report on Lai's trip - Focus Taiwan President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) currently has no plans to travel overseas, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesperson Hsiao Kuangwei (蕭光偉) said Tuesday, denying media reports that Lai's planned trip to Paraguay through New York was blocked by the United States. At a routine MOFA press briefing, Hsiao denied a Financial Times report that said Lai's planned visits to diplomatic allies Paraguay, Guatemala, and Belize were delayed or cancelled due to U.S. President Donald Trump blocking a stopover in New York following protests from China. China firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between US and Taiwan island: FM responds to Trump administration’s reported block of Lai’s stopover - Global Times In response to a question that whether Chinese government has contacted the US government over Bloomberg's report that Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te appeared to call off South America trip after the Trump administration didn't greenlight his stopover in the US, Chinese FM spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Tuesday that "First of all, Taiwan is a province of China, and there is no such thing as a president."China has taken note of the relevant reports. I would like to emphasize that the Chinese government firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between the US and the island of Taiwan, and resolutely opposes the leader of the Taiwan region recklessly visiting the US under any name or pretext. This position is consistent, clear, and firm, said Guo. Blocking anti-Japanese war veterans from visiting mainland exposes Lai’s betrayal of the nation: Global Times editorial - Global Times What is both shocking and infuriating is that the DPP authorities not only refuse to hold commemorative events for the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, but also smear the participation of veteran soldiers from Taiwan in mainland's commemorations as "united front tactics" and "cognitive warfare." They have even gone so far as to threaten these veterans with the revocation of their pensions, which has completely torn off Lai's hypocritical mask and laid bare the DPP's true nature as a "green terror" regime rooted in authoritarianism.On the issue of wartime history, the DPP authorities have long pushed for "de-Sinicization," deliberately obscuring and distorting Taiwan's historical role in the war, and forcibly severing the deep-rooted blood ties between the residents of Taiwan and the Chinese nation. They seek to make the younger generation forget the bloody sacrifices of their forebears and to detach Taiwan society from its historical identity as part of the Chinese nation. Such shameless manipulation is not only a grave betrayal of historical truth but also a disgraceful insult to the martyrs who gave their lives in the war. Taiwan mulls chip restrictions amid South Africa name change row - Focus Taiwan Taiwan is considering restricting semiconductor exports to South Africa in response to what it described as a "crude" downgrade of its diplomatic presence in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday. To "safeguard national sovereignty and dignity, we are discussing countermeasures with relevant government agencies, including restricting chip exports to South Africa," Philippe Yen (顏嘉良), director-general for MOFA's Department of West Asian and African Affairs, said at a news briefing. Exclusive: Nvidia orders 300,000 H20 chips from TSMC due to robust China demand, sources say | Reuters The new orders with Taiwan's TMSC would add to existing inventory of 600,000 to 700,000 H20 chips, according to the sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.For comparison purposes, Nvidia sold around 1 million H20 chips in 2024, according to U.S. research firm SemiAnalysis...Nvidia needs to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government to ship the H20 chips. It said in mid-July it had been assured by authorities that it would get them soon.The U.S. Department of Commerce has yet to approve those licenses, one of the sources and a third source said. China's latest AI model claims to be even cheaper to use than DeepSeek Startup Z.ai, formerly known as Zhipu, announced Monday that its new GLM-4.5 AI model would cost less than DeepSeek to use. Like DeepSeek, the new model is also open source and can be downloaded for free. At about half the size of DeepSeek’s model, GLM-4.5 only needs eight Nvidia H20 chips to operate, Z.ai CEO Zhang Peng told CNBC on Monday. China’s tech hub Shenzhen mandates leniency for innovators whose state-funded projects fail | South China Morning Post Authorities in China’s southern tech hub of Shenzhen have called for leniency towards innovators whose government-funded projects fail or do not pass evaluation. The first policy statement of its kind from the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission comes as China aims to cement the city’s status as a hi-tech powerhouse and reduce reliance on foreign technology amid a sustained strategic rivalry with the United States. The new rules applied to all universities, hospitals and companies that undertake technical innovation with government financial aid, the commission said in a statement on its website last Monday. How Cursor’s Global Success Is Lifted by China — The Information When a powerful typhoon battered Guangzhou earlier this month, hundreds of programmers in the southern Chinese city braved torrential rain and gusting wind to show up to an event they’d been waiting for: Cursor’s first meetup in the city. More than 300 people turned out to watch a pre-recorded video of Eric Zakariasson, a San Francisco–based employee of Cursor’s parent, Anysphere, responding to questions submitted by participants. Later, attendees discussed how to use Cursor for development of artificial intelligent agents, academic research and retail sector applications. The four-hour gathering, part of a global Cursor program designed to foster use of the AI coding tool, illustrated Cursor’s quietly growing popularity in China, which has helped fuel the company’s global success.

Groq raised $640 million at a $2.8 billion valuation in August 2024, making this double the valuation in about a year. Groq previously raised about $1 billion. The new round is led by Austin-based firm Disruptive, Bloomberg reports. The November round was led by BlackRock, with participation from Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, Cisco, KDDI, and Samsung Catalyst Fund. Groq was founded by Jonathan Ross, who previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip. The startup emerged from stealth in 2016.

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus for BAR, please visithttps://www.graniteshares.com/Documents/25/Prospectus-GraniteShares-Gold-Trust.pdfTo obtain a prospectus for PLTM, please visithttps://graniteshares.com/media/gwrbh3ah/pltm_prospectus.pdfTo obtain a prospectus for COMB, please visithttps://graniteshares.com/media/4crf2x4e/graniteshares-etf-trust-comb-summary-prospectus.pdf Except as described above regarding the liquidation of the ETFs, shares of the Funds may be sold during trading hours on the exchange through any brokerage account, shares are not individually redeemable, and shares may only be redeemed directly from a Fund by Authorized Participants. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security.

For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer.

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus.

Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses.

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

Title: The Fed is expected to hold rates steady as Trump pushes for a cut

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The Federal Reserve has so far resisted President Donald Trump's aggressive pressure campaign to throw inflation concerns out and attempt to boost the U.S. economy with lower interest rates. That's expected to continue Wednesday, as the central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged. If so, that’s likely to annoy Trump, who is already reshaping the global economy with his tariffs. The Fed’s rate setting committee began its two-day meeting Tuesday. Market projections and analysts expect it won't cut its key rate. “We expect Chair Powell to reiterate his view that the Fed can afford to remain on hold to assess the tariff impact as long as the U.S. economy and labor market remain strong,” analysts with financial group Nomura said in a note published Friday. “Data released lately have pointed to nascent signs of tariff-induced price pressures. Additionally, growth data have remained robust.” The central bank, which is tasked with using its influential interest rates to balance inflation and unemployment, is weighing whether the time is right to loosen the flow of cash into the economy at the risk of rising prices. Most data indicates the economy is in solid shape. At 4.1%, the unemployment rate is relatively low — though the median time it takes an unemployed person to find a job has surged to more than 10 weeks. Stocks are at all-time highs, in large part thanks to bets on the potential for artificial intelligence to transform companies' bottom lines. The biggest wild card is inflation. For the first five months of Trump's second term, inflation readings were relatively subdued. But in June, the economy began to show the first signs of increased price pressures as a result of the tariffs, with price growth for goods such as apparel, appliances and toys accelerating. Economic forecasters and business surveys suggest tariffs are likely to continue to feed into higher consumer prices. That has complicated the picture for the Fed. An ironic twist: Jerome Powell has said the Fed might have cut already were it not for Trump initiating his sprawling and volatile tariff policy as inflation continued to cool. Trump has been especially hard on Powell, raising fears in Washington and Wall Street that he may try to fire the Fed chair. For now, Trump has seemingly backed off the idea, though some experts say it is unclear whether he has the legal authority to do so anyway. Still, Trump and administration officials have continued to put the squeeze on Powell and the Fed — raising concerns about the central bank’s long-standing independence and immunity to political interference. Trump has said cutting rates would boost the economy by making it cheaper to borrow money and also reduce the amount that the U.S. government has to pay on its debts. Powell has showed no signs he would budge to political pressure. The Fed’s key rate is set by a group called the Federal Open Market Committee. Powell is head of the panel, but it includes 11 other members — two of whom, like Powell, were appointed by Trump during his first term. Those two, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, have openly called for lowering rates. They argue that the pace of price growth has been largely contained, that any bump in costs from tariffs will be short lived and that there are signs of accelerated weakening in the job market. The committee meets eight times a year to discuss monetary policy, including whether to raise, lower or hold rates steady. The Fed chair serves as the public face of that committee and leads those meetings, so the central bank's head can have some influence over the debate and direction of the discussion. It only takes a simple majority of the committee to vote in favor of a rate change. Forecasters have said Bowman and Waller may dissent from this week's likely decision to hold pat. The FOMC has not registered more than one dissent in more than three decades, something that may reflect ongoing uncertainty about the current state of the economy, but could also suggest political concerns have entered the discussion. If the FOMC does not lower rates this month, it is likely to before the end of the year. As of Tuesday, markets pegged the chances of a cut in September above 60%. A cut in the Fed's key rate may not immediately translate into reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, cars or credit cards. The reason: The Fed targets short-term interest rates, not borrowing costs spread out over multiple years. In other words, a decline in the Fed’s target interest rate does not immediately lead to a comparable decline in consumer-facing interest rates — even if lenders use the Fed as a benchmark. Home loans are especially disconnected from the Fed’s short-term borrowing targets. Instead, banks and other lenders set mortgage rates using a range of factors, with a major one being the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds. Since the onset of the Covid pandemic, the 10-year rate has steadily climbed to about 4.5%, helping lift mortgage rates to about 6.5%. The greatest driver of interest rates is inflation expectations. If investors expect price growth to erode purchasing power, they will start asking for higher interest rates. Right now, the Federal Reserve believes inflation expectations are mostly in check, although Trump’s tariffs have introduced a persistent level of uncertainty. The FOMC's decision to hold its key rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% this year has helped keep a lid on inflation, by curbing overall demand in the economy. If Powell were to be removed, analysts say, it is likely that inflation expectations would become “unanchored” if it suddenly becomes easier for businesses to raise prices assuming demand increases. That would lead to faster inflation, and thus higher interest rates in the economy — even if the FOMC were to vote for a cut. That includes the cost of borrowing for the federal government. Anything that creates major uncertainty among investors about the stability of the U.S. economy can cause Treasury yields to rise. Less demand for Treasury bonds means the federal government has to pay a higher yield to convince investors to buy them. If Trump were to fire Powell, investors have warned that 10-year Treasury yields would increase. That would help push home mortgage rates higher. There’s also concern that firing Powell would trigger stock market volatility. It already ramped up earlier this month, as speculation about the future of Powell’s job reached a fever pitch. “Long story short, it’s not a pretty picture,” analysts with Capital Economics said in a recent note to clients on how the market would respond if Trump tried to remove Powell. Still, even if Powell were sidelined, the next central banker up — Vice Chairman Philip Jefferson, who was appointed by then-President Joe Biden — hasn’t exactly embraced rate cuts recently. In May, he said the Fed’s policy was in “a very good place” and that the central bank could afford to be patient. Shannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News.

If the proposal is approved, the world’s largest asset manager would be able to participate in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus model using its ETFs’ funds, while also passing along those rewards to its shareholders, according to a filing published by the SEC. The filing notes that the SEC could make a determination within 45 days of the document’s posting to the Federal Registrar, however, that window can be extended. And the regulator has already acknowledged similar filings from other asset managers in recent months. In May, for example, the SEC gave notice that it was extending its decision deadline for a rule change submitted by NYSE Arca to permit staking for Bitwise’s spot Ethereum ETF. The regulator acknowledged the proposal in the Federal Registrar in early April. Later that month, the SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale’s efforts to support staking for its flagship Ethereum ETF fund. The proposal, which was also submitted by NYSE Arca, was acknowledged by the regulator in February. Under the proposal for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), the asset manager could tap staking providers, and the resulting rewards would be treated as income for the trust. It would prevent the funds from being pooled with Ethereum belonging to other entities as well. Inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs have outpaced those to its Bitcoin counterparts as the asset has climbed recently to a nearly eight-month high. However, the lack of rewards from staking has been viewed as a drawback for the products since their debut a year ago. In April, the SEC approved of a rule change allowing Nasdaq to list options for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF and three other funds. This year, it has also said that it does not believe staking is subject to securities laws. Spot Ethereum ETFs have generated $9.4 billion in net inflows since their debut, with BlackRock’s ETF contributing $9.5 billion, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. Inflows from seven other products have been outweighed by $4.3 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum ETF (ETHE). That fund differs from the others because it was a conversion from a trust and carries the highest expense ratio. Ethereum was recently changing hands around $3,800 on Tuesday, a 0.4% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Over the past month, it’s swelled 54% alongside other altcoins, including XRP and Solana.

Title: NYC gunman Shane Tamura’s former football coach, teammate recall killer as ‘gifted’ athlete who became ‘completely different’ person
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/29/us-news/nyc-gunman-shane-tamuras-former-football-coach-teammate-recall-killer-as-gifted-athlete-who-became-completely-different-person/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T20:37:44Z
Full Content:
Park Avenue ​mass shooter Shane Tamura was “completely different” a decade ago as a star high-school athlete​ — before he ​began express​ing suicidal thoughts ​in recent years and gambling to excess while working nights as a security guard at a Las Vegas casino. ​The Midtown killer’s descent into homicidal madness stunned those who knew him growing up. “Nine years ago, he was a completely different Shane,” a 28-year-old former teammate told The Post on Tuesday — the day after Tamura shot up a Manhattan skyscraper in a failed attempt to target NFL headquarters, which he blamed for alleged brain injuries despite never playing in the league. “Compared to what’s on the news, I don’t think any one of us, none of my teammates, sensed anything like this from Shane,” said the man, who asked not to be publicized. “He was very devoted to football, he was a very good player, but off the field he was very like, nice, positive. He never really had conflict with anyone,” the man said. Tamura was a standout running back at Granada Hills Charter and Golden Valley high schools in Los Angeles County, garnering numerous accolades including being named player of the game five times during his junior year in 2015. “He was very quiet. He led by his actions more than his word. He was athletically gifted. One of the best running backs that I coached,” said Walter Roby, 60, who coached Tamura during his senior year at Granada Hills, to The Post. “He was coachable, meaning when you can ask him to do something he would do it. He was quiet, humble. He knew his athletic ability but he wasn’t boastful about that.” Roby said he was “heartbroken” at the news his former player had perpetrated the heinous mass shooting. “It’s just shocking. It took me a while to come to grips with it. that was tough,” the coach said. Granada Hills Charter issued a statement Tuesday saying Tamura withdrew from the school after attending the 2015 fall semester and has had no connection with the academy since. “We are horrified by the violence in New York. It is heartbreaking, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the victims, their families, and affected communities,” the school wrote​. Tamura took his own life after his shooting spree, in which he killed three office workers and an NYPD officer as he stormed 345 Park Ave. in Midtown with an AR-style rifle Monday evening, apparently targeting the NFL, Mayor Eric Adams said. Police found a rambling three-page note stashed in Tamura’s wallet in which he blamed football for his alleged struggle with CTE — the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy — and begged for his brain to be studied after his death. The note also included an apology to someone named Rick, who sources identified as the owner of the crucial part of the gun that Tamura used. Rick was Tamura’s supervisor at the Horseshoe Las Vegas Casino, sources said. Detectives have located the gun’s owner and are currently questioning him, as well as the seller of the weapon’s lower receiver, which an NYPD spokesman described as “what makes the rifle fire.” Investigators are still working to determine Tamura’s exact motive, but sources said he is believed to have suffered at least two mental health incidents in 2022 and 2024. He received his gun permit in 2022, and a short time later notified police he was having suicidal ideations — which are not grounds for having a permit revoked, a source told The Post. In 2024, Tamura had a second mental health contact. Both mental-health struggled ended up with him being held for 72 hours of observation, sources said. He also had two arrests on his record, including a 2012 trespassing charge in California and a charge in Nevada in 2023 for throwing a substance at a vehicle with intent to cause great bodily harm. In 2021, Tamura had a pair of high-value cash transactions at Nevada casinos, sources said, including spending $16,615 at the Coast Hotel and Casino and months later winning $12,860 at a casino affiliated with Hotspur Resorts Nevada Inc. Sources told The Post police found the prescription medication Sumatriptan, used for relieving migraine symptoms, in Tamura’s BMW, which he had double-parked outside 345 Park Ave. before waltzing into the building with his assault rifle. The gunman’s former high school teammate told The Post he never saw any indication Tamura was struggling with mental illness. He conceded, however, that people sometimes change over time. “You might know someone 9, 10, 12 years ago in general life and time can change a lot of things. I don’t know what happened. It could have been some sort of mental illness, some kind of stress, something could have happened, I really have no idea.” As for whether Tamura ever got banged up enough on the field to wind up with a CTE diagnosis — as has afflicted a number of high-profile NFL players — Roby said he couldn’t recall anything but an ankle injury that sidelined him for a single game. Asked whether he was good enough to have a chance to get drafted into the NFL one day, Roby said it was tough to say. “Did he have the ability to play at the college level? Definitely had that athletic ability. As far as the NFL, I don’t know. Being in the NFL, you’re talking about the 1% of the 1%. I don’t know if he had that type of skill set.” Additional reporting by Tina Moore Advertisement

The new feature will allow clients to buy and sell stocks around the clock—24 hours, seven days a week—in the form of ECR-20 tokens. eToro said that 24/5 trading of 100 of the most popular U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs will come first. "We are part of the largest transfer of wealth in human history, from older generations to younger generations—with the rise of retail investors," eToro CEO Yoni Assia said in a webinar announcing the new product. "[Younger, retail investors] are finding out about capital markets," he said, adding that a big part of the transfer of wealth will be via new technologies and a paradigm shift in financial systems. The announcement comes as eToro and other financial services firms have expanded their crypto-related services and amid growing interest in tokenization. The Israel-based firm has long been involved in tokenizing assets for its customers, introducing tokenized gold and silver after buying Danish token startup Firmo in 2019. In March, BlackRock, the world’s biggest fund manager, announced its first tokenized fund. Its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund runs on Ethereum, the blockchain behind the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH. BlackRock CEO and one-time crypto skeptic Larry Fink has come around to the idea. Real-world assets have notched a combined $12.19 billion in total-value locked on decentralized platforms as digitizing traditional financial instruments becomes increasingly popular in Web3. Analysts are forecasting further gains in the market as investors flock to tokenized RWA products. Global investment firm VanEck has predicted RWAs will surpass $50 billion in market capitalization by the end of 2025. Ethereum is the dominant platform for tokenization. eToro was among the earliest firms to explore Bitcoin, acquiring its first BTC when the largest cryptocurrency by market value was selling for $5 (it subsequently sold these early holdings), and allowed trading of the asset in 2013. It added the same service for a range of other tokens. eToro was down more than 4% in Tuesday trading and is off nearly 10% year-to-date, according to Yahoo Finance. Ethereum was trading at $3,775, down the better part of a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Title: JPMorgan Chase Says ‘Significant Leap Forward’ Underway for Tokenized Money Market Funds Amid Goldman and BNY Partnership: Report

Full Content:
Analysts at the financial giant JPMorgan Chase think Goldman Sachs’ new partnership with BNY is a “significant leap forward” for tokenized money market funds, according to a new Bloomberg report. Goldman and BNY recently announced a joint venture to launch tokenized money market fund services using a blockchain developed by Goldman. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management all plan to participate in the launch of the new service. Teresa Ho, a managing director at JPMorgan, tells Bloomberg the partnership could expand the use cases for money market funds. “The true takeaway from this is beyond the typical way we see money funds being used as a cash management asset class — they can now use it as collateral. Instead of posting cash, or posting Treasuries, you can post money-market shares and not lose interest along the way. It speaks to the versatility of money funds.” Ho also notes that numerous other financial firms see the potential benefit of tokenization amid blossoming regulatory clarity. “This is true across banks, asset managers, and payment processors. We wouldn’t be surprised to continue to see more developments with respect to stablecoins being more integrated with the traditional financial system, as well as more tokenization of real-world assets.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

In a letter to Duke President Vincent Price, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Adam Silver and School of Medicine Dean Mary Klotman, Secretaries Robert F.

"The United States invests in medical care and research because of the sacredness of human life and value of human health," the letter read. "There is arguably no other area of our educational system where the rejection of merit is more dangerous than in medicine, where the competence of doctors means the difference between life and death for patients, and where scientific discovery is the difference between life-saving cures and the ravages of disease."…READ MORE.

Title: Authorities say shooter in New York City blamed NFL for brain injuries

The US football league has previously faced legal challenges over its failure to address players’ concussions. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has said that a gunman who killed five people, including himself, sought out the headquarters of the National Football League (NFL), which he blamed for the brain injuries he suffered from. Adams said on Tuesday that a note carried by the shooter, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, suggests his target was the NFL. “The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy], a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports,” Adams told CBS News. “He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury.” But Tamura appears to have arrived at the wrong floor of a New York City office tower and instead opened fire in the offices of a real estate firm, on top of shooting people in the ground-floor lobby. The NFL has previously faced litigation relating to concussions suffered by football players. The organisation, which oversees professional US football, has denied any link between conditions like CTE and its sport, but it has nevertheless paid out more than $1bn to settle concussion-related lawsuits. Monday’s shooting has also renewed debate about mass shootings and access to firearms in the US. Tamura reportedly entered the building with an AR-15-style rifle. The NFL’s headquarters are located in a skyscraper that it shares with other firms. Tamara is believed to have started shooting as he entered the lobby of the skyscraper. Then, police believe he took the wrong elevator, arriving at the 33rd floor, which contained the offices of Rudin Management, a real estate firm. There, he opened fire once more and then took his own life. Among those killed in the shooting was a 36-year-old police officer named Didarul Islam, who had come to the US from Bangladesh and had been on the force for three years. Other victims include security guard Aland Etienne, Julia Hyman of Rudin Management, and an executive at the BlackRock investment firm, Wesley LePatner. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell stated in a memo that there would be an “increased security presence” at the organisation’s offices over the coming weeks. Tamura is a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada, with a history of mental health issues. He never played in the NFL, but he did play football in high school. The news outlet Bloomberg reported that Tamura’s note alleges that his football career was cut short by a brain injury. The note also called for his brain to be studied. CTE can only be diagnosed through an autopsy. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: SEC filing starts countdown on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF staking proposal

The SEC acknowledged a Nasdaq filing from July 16, prompting a 45-day period for response, extendable up to 90 days. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged on July 29 a Nasdaq proposal to amend BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) so the fund may stake the ETH it holds. Nasdaq’s filing would delete a prior representation that neither BlackRock nor the custodian would use any ETH held by the exchange-traded fund (ETF) to validate Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake chain or earn income. The proposal would add a new “staking” section authorizing the stake some or all ETHA’s Ethereum directly or through one or more trusted staking providers, with any staking rewards payable to the ETF and potentially treated as income. Nasdaq filed on July 16 to add staking to BlackRock’s ETHA, seeking to add a detailed section that permits the staking directly or via trusted providers, treat rewards as income, and operate under the Corp Fin statement while securing tax clarity before launch. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart called the Nasdaq submission “about time,” noting the first final deadline for earlier filings arrives in October, while Nasdaq’s BlackRock filing carries an early‑April, 2026, deadline. Yet, he expects a decision sooner. In the competitive queue, Cboe has sought authority for Fidelity’s FETH, Franklin Templeton’s EZET, Invesco Galaxy’s QETH, and 21Shares’ CETH. At the same time, NYSE Arca is pursuing the same authorization for Bitwise’s ETHW, and Grayscale’s ETHE and its mini trust. The rush for authorization to allow staking in spot ETFs picked up the pace after the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance stated on May 29 that participants in standard protocol staking activities do not need to register those activities as securities transactions. The regulator statement includes self‑staking, delegated staking, custodial staking, and non‑custodial staking. Additionally, service features such as early withdrawals, slashing protection, or asset aggregation do not convert staking into a securities offering under federal law by themselves. Nasdaq argues that permitting ETHA to stake would better align the product with Ether‑holding returns, improve creation and redemption efficiency, and benefit end investors. The filing also describes staking’s role in supporting Ethereum’s validation process and compensating validators via block rewards. After publication in the Federal Register, the Commission has 45 days, extendable up to 90 days, to approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings on the proposal. The SEC has also invited public comments on the matter. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: The Making of Dario Amodei
URL: https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/the-making-of-dario-amodei
Time Published: 2025-07-29T18:36:34Z
Full Content:
Dario Amodei doesn’t hesitate when I ask what’s gotten into him. The Anthropic CEO has spent 2025 at war, feuding with industry counterparts, members of the government, and the public’s perception of artificial intelligence. In recent months, he’s predicted that AI could soon eliminate 50% of entry-level, white-collar jobs. He’s railed against a ten-year AI regulation moratorium in the pages of the New York Times. And he’s called for semiconductor export controls to China, drawing a public rebuke from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Amid it all, Amodei meets me on the first floor of his company’s downtown San Francisco headquarters. He’s loose, energetic, and anxious to get started, as if he’s been waiting for this moment to address his actions. Sporting a blue shawl-collar sweater over a casual white t-shirt, and boxy thick-rimmed glasses, he sits down and stares ahead. Underlying his efforts, Amodei says, is a firm belief that AI is moving faster than most of us appreciate, making its opportunities and consequences much closer than they appear. “I am indeed one of the most bullish about AI capabilities improving very fast,” he tells me. “As we've gotten more close to AI systems that are more powerful, I've wanted to say those things more forcefully, more publicly, to make the point clearer.” Amodei’s outspokenness and sharp elbows have earned him both respect and derision in Silicon Valley. He’s seen by some as a technological visionary who pioneered OpenAI’s GPT-3 project (the seeds of ChatGPT) and a safety-minded leader who broke off and founded Anthropic. Others see him as a control-oriented “doomer” who wants to slow AI progress, shape it to his liking, and shut out the competition. Love him or hate him, the AI field will have to deal with him. Amodei has turned Anthropic, currently valued at $61 billion, into an economic force. From a zero start in 2021, the company — though still unprofitable — has grown its annualized recurring revenue from $1.4 billion in March 2025 to $3 billion in May to nearly $4.5 billion in July, leading Amodei to call it the “fastest growing software company in history at the scale that it's at.” Perhaps more notable than Anthropic’s revenue is the way it’s coming in. Rather than relying primarily on applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Amodei’s biggest bet is on the underlying technology itself. Most of the company’s revenue, Amodei tells me, is earned via its API, or through other companies buying Anthropic’s AI models and using them within their own products. Anthropic will thus be a barometer of AI’s progress, rising and falling on the strength of the technology. As Anthropic grows, Amodei hopes its heft will help him influence the industry’s direction. And given his willingness to speak out, throw a punch, and take one, he’s probably right. So if this man will steer what may be the world’s most influential new technology, it’s worth understanding what drives him, his business, and why his timeline is shorter than so many others’. And after more than two dozen interviews with him, his friends, colleagues, and competitors, I believe I have an answer. Dario Amodei was a science kid. Born in San Francisco in 1983 to a Jewish mother and an Italian father, he was interested almost entirely in math and physics. When the dot-com boom exploded around him in his high school years, it barely registered. “Writing some website actually had no interest to me whatsoever,” he tells me. “I was interested in discovering fundamental scientific truth.” At home, Amodei was very close with his parents, a loving couple who he says sought to improve the world. His mother Elena Engel ran renovation and construction projects for libraries in Berkeley and San Francisco. His father Riccardo Amodei was a trained leathersmith. “They gave me a sense of right and wrong and what was important in the world,” he says, “imbuing a strong sense of responsibility.” That sense of responsibility showed up in Amodei’s undergrad years at Caltech, where he lambasted his fellow students over their passivity toward the forthcoming Iraq war. “The problem isn't that everyone is just peachy with the idea of bombing Iraq; it's that most people are opposed in principle but refuse to give one millisecond of their time,” Amodei wrote in The California Tech, a student newspaper, on March 3, 2003. “This needs to change, right now and without delay.” Then, in his early 20s, Amodei’s life changed forever. His father Riccardo, who’d long fought a rare illness, lost the battle in 2006. Riccardo’s passing shocked Amodei, and he shifted his graduate studies at Princeton from theoretical physics to biology to address human illness and biological problems. The rest of Amodei’s life has, in some ways, been dedicated to addressing his father’s loss, especially because within four years, a new breakthrough turned the illness from something that was 50% fatal to 95% curable. “There was someone who worked on the cure to this disease, that managed to cure it, and save a bunch of people's lives,” Amodei says, “but could have saved even more.” “I get really angry when someone's like, “This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down’” - Dario Amodei Amodei’s father’s passing has shaped his life’s path to this day, says Jade Wang, who dated him in the early 2010s. “It's the difference between his father most likely dying and most likely living, okay?,” she says, explaining that had scientific progress sped up a bit, Amodei’s father might still be with us. It just took a while before he found AI as a vessel to do it. Upon recalling his father’s death, Amodei grows animated. His calls for export controls and AI safeguards, he believes, have been mischaracterized as the actions of someone irrationally seeking to impede AI progress. “I get really angry when someone's like, ‘This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,’” Amodei tells me. “You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.” At Princeton, still raw from his father’s loss, Amodei began his quest to decode human biology by studying the retina. Our eyes capture the world by sending signals to the visual cortex — a large part of the brain that takes up 30% of the cerebral cortex — which then processes the data and shows us a picture. If you’re looking to tackle the complexity of the human physiology, the retina is a great place to start. “He used the retina to look at a complete neural population and actually understand what every cell was doing, or at least have that opportunity,” Stephanie Palmer, one of Amodei’s contemporaries at Princeton, tells me. “It was about that more than the eye. He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” Working in Professor Michael Berry’s retina lab, Amodei was so dissatisfied with the methods available to measure the retina’s signals that he co-invented a new, better sensor to pick up more data. This was atypical for the lab, at once impressive and nonconformist. His dissertation won the Hertz Thesis Prize, a prestigious award granted to those who discover real-world applications in their academic work. But Amodei’s penchant for poking at norms, and his strident sense of the way things should be, set him apart in an academic setting. Berry tells me that Amodei was the most talented graduate student he ever had, but his focus on technological progress and teamwork didn’t play well in a system built to recognize individual achievement. “I think internally, he was kind of a proud person,” Berry tells me. “I imagine his whole academic career up until that point, whenever he did something, people would stand up and clap. And that was not really happening here.” “He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” - Stephanie Palmer When Amodei left Princeton, the door to AI opened. He began postdoc work under researcher Parag Mallick at Stanford, studying proteins in and around tumors to detect metastatic cancer cells. The work was complex, showing Amodei the limits of what people could do alone, and he started looking for technological solutions. “The complexity of the underlying problems in biology felt like it was beyond human scale,” Amodei tells me. “In order to understand it all, you needed hundreds, thousands of human researchers.” Amodei saw that potential in emerging AI technologies. At the time, an explosion of data and computing power was sparking breakthroughs in machine learning, a subset of AI that long held theoretical potential but had shown middling results until then. After Amodei began experimenting with the technology, he realized it might eventually stand in for those thousands of researchers. “AI, which I was just starting to see the discoveries in, felt to me like the only technology that could kind of bridge that gap,” he says, something that “could bring us beyond human scale.” Amodei left academia to pursue AI advancement in the corporate world, which had the cash to support it. He considered founding a startup, then leaned toward Google, which had a well-funded AI research division in Google Brain and just acquired DeepMind. But Chinese search engine Baidu had handed the esteemed researcher Andrew Ng a $100 million budget to research and deploy AI, and he began to form a superteam. Ng reached out to Amodei, who was intrigued and applied. When Amodei’s application arrived at Baidu, the full team didn't know what to do with it. “He had an impressive background, but his background, from our perspective, was in biology. It was not in machine learning,” Greg Diamos, an early member of the team, tells me. Diamos then looked at Amodei’s code from Stanford, and encouraged the team to hire him. “I was thinking, anyone who can write this has got to be an amazingly good programmer,” he says. Amodei joined Baidu in November 2014. With their vast resources, the Baidu team could throw computing power and data at problems in an attempt to improve their outcomes. They saw remarkable results. In their experiments, Amodei and his colleagues found that AI’s performance improved meaningfully as they added more of these ingredients. The team released a paper on speech recognition that showed that model size directly correlated with performance. “It had a big impact on me, because I saw these very smooth trends,” Amodei says. Amodei’s early work at Baidu contributed to what’s known as the AI “scaling laws,” which are really more of an observation. The scaling laws state that increasing computing power, data, and model size in AI training leads to predictable performance improvements. Scaling everything up, in other words, makes AI better, no novel methods needed. “This was, to me, the most significant discovery I've seen in my life,” Diamos tells me. To this day, Amodei is perhaps the purest believer in the scaling laws among AI research leaders. While peers like Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun suggest the AI industry needs further breakthroughs to reach human-level artificial intelligence, Amodei speaks with a certainty — though not complete — that the path forward is clear. And as the industry erects massive data centers the size of small cities, he sees exceptionally powerful AI fast approaching. “I see this exponential,” he says. “When you're on an exponential, you can really get fooled by it. Two years away from when the exponential goes totally crazy it looks like it's just starting.” At Baidu, the AI team’s progress became seeds of its undoing. Turf battles broke out within the company over control of its increasingly valuable technology, know-how, and resources. Eventually, meddling from powerbrokers in China sparked a talent exodus and the lab fell apart. Andrew Ng declined to comment. As Baidu’s AI team crumbled, Elon Musk invited Amodei and a number of leading AI researchers to a now-famous dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park. Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever all attended. Seeing AI’s emerging potential, and concerned Google could solidify control over it, Musk decided to fund a new competitor, which became OpenAI. Altman, Brockman, and Sutskever co-founded the new research house with Musk. Amodei thought about joining, felt unsure about the fledgling organization, and went to Google Brain instead. After ten months stuck in large-company morass at Google, Amodei reconsidered. He joined OpenAI in 2016, and got to work on AI safety. He’d grown interested in safety at Google, where he worried about the rapidly improving technology’s capacity for harm and co-authored a paper on its potential for bad behavior. As Amodei settled in at OpenAI, his former Google colleagues introduced the transformer model, the technology behind today’s generative AI moment, in a paper called “Attention is All You Need.” The transformer enabled faster training and much larger models than prior methods. Despite the discovery’s great potential, Google mostly sat on it. OpenAI, meanwhile, got to work. It released its first large language model called “GPT” (the “T” stands for transformer) in 2018. The model generated often-broken text but still demonstrated meaningful improvement over previous language generation methods. Amodei, who’d become a research director at OpenAI, got directly involved in the next iteration, GPT-2, which was effectively the same model as GPT, just bigger. The OpenAI team fine-tuned GPT-2 with a technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback, something Amodei helped pioneer, which helped guide its values. GPT-2 delivered much better results than GPT, as expected, showing an ability to paraphrase, write, and answer questions somewhat coherently. Language models soon became the focal point at OpenAI. As Amodei’s profile increased within OpenAI, so did the controversy around him. A prolific writer, he’d produce long documents about values and technology, which some colleagues saw as inspirational but others saw as flag planting and heavy handed. (One such memo: an exploration of “M” companies vs. “P” companies, where Ms provide market-focused goods and Ps provide public-focused goods). Amodei, to some, was also too focused on maintaining secrecy around the technology’s potential and collaborating with the government to address it. And he could be a bit abrasive, sometimes disparaging projects he didn’t believe in. OpenAI still entrusted Amodei with the leadership of the GPT-3 project, handing him 50-60% of the entire company’s compute to build a massively scaled up version of its language model. The jump from GPT to GPT-2 was large, a ten-fold increase. But the jump from GPT-2 to GPT-3 would be massive, a 100x project costing tens of millions of dollars. The results were stunning. The New York Times quoted independent researchers surprised by the GPT-3’s ability to code, summarize, and translate. Amodei, who was relatively restrained upon the release of GPT-2, gushed about his new model. “It has this emergent quality,” he told the Times. “It has some ability to recognize the pattern that you gave it and complete the story.” But cracks beneath the surface at OpenAI began to tear wide open. With the creation of GPT-3, the first capable language model, the stakes for Amodei increased. After seeing the scaling laws work in multiple disciplines at this point, Amodei considered where the technology was headed and developed an even greater interest in safety. “He looked at this technology and assumed it would work,” Jack Clark, a close colleague of Amodei’s at OpenAI, tells me. “And if you assume it works, in the sense that it's going to be as smart as a person, you can't help but be concerned of the safety things in some sense.” Though Amodei led OpenAI’s model development, and directed a good chunk of its compute, parts of the company were out of his hands. This included deciding when to release models, personnel matters, how the company deploys its technology, and how it represents itself externally. “Many of those things,” Amodei says, “are not things that you control just by training the models.” Amodei, by then, had formed a tight-knit group of coworkers around him — which some called “the pandas,” due to his love of the animal — and had very different ideas from OpenAI leadership about how to handle these functions. Infighting ensued, and the factions developed an intense dislike for each other. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it” - Jensen Huang In our conversation, Amodei didn’t mask his feelings. “The leaders of a company, they have to be trustworthy people,” he says. “They have to be people whose motivations are sincere, no matter how much you're driving forward the company technically. If you're working for someone whose motivations are not sincere, who's not an honest person, who does not truly want to make the world better, it's not going to work. You're just contributing to something bad.” Within OpenAI, some saw Amodei’s focus on safety as a route to control the company altogether. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently echoed these criticisms after Amodei called for GPU export controls to China. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it,” Huang said. “That's the most outrageous lie I've ever heard,” Amodei tells me of Huang’s claim, adding he’s always wanted to spark a ‘race to the top’ by encouraging others to emulate Anthropic’s safety practices. “I’ve said nothing that anywhere near resembles the idea that this company should be the only one to build the technology. I don't know how anyone could ever derive that from anything that I've said. It’s just an incredible and bad faith distortion.” My full conversation with Amodei will be live on Big Technology Podcast tomorrow. You can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your app of choice. Nvidia, which just won a rollback of some of Amodei’s favored export controls, doubled down. "We support safe, responsible, and transparent AI. Thousands of startups and developers in our ecosystem and the open-source community are enhancing safety,” an Nvidia spokesperson tells me. “Lobbying for regulatory capture against open source will only stifle innovation, make AI less safe and secure, and less democratic. That's not a 'race to the top' or the way for America to win." OpenAI hit back as well, via a company spokesperson. “We’ve always believed that AI should benefit and empower everyone, not just those who say it’s too risky for anyone but themselves to develop safely,” the spokesperson says. “As the technology has evolved, our decisions on partnerships, model releases, and funding have become standard across the industry, including at Anthropic. What hasn’t changed is our focus on making AI safe, useful, and available to as many people as possible.” Over time, the differences between Amodei’s group and OpenAI’s leaders became so untenable that something had to give. “Fifty percent of our time was spent trying to convince other people of views that we held, and fifty percent was spent working,” Clark says. So in December 2020, Amodei, Clark, Amodei’s sister Daniela, researcher Chris Olah, and a handful of others departed OpenAI to start something new. In a conference room within Anthropic offices, Clark turns around his laptop and displays one of Anthropic’s earliest documents. It’s a list of names including Aligned AI, Generative, Sponge, Swan, Sloth, and Sparrow Systems. Anthropic, a word that connotes being human centered and human oriented, is also there, and it also happened to be an available domain name in early 2021. “We like the name it is good,” the team wrote in the spreadsheet. And thus, Anthropic was born. Anthropic was formed in the heart of Covid, meeting entirely on Zoom amid the pandemic’s second wave. Eventually, its 15 to 20 employees would meet for weekly lunches in San Francisco’s Precita Park, pulling up their own chairs to talk business. The company’s early mission was simple: Build leading large language models, implement safe practices to pressure others to follow, and publish what it learned, apart from its models’ core technical details. It might sound odd that the group of less than two dozen people meeting in a park with their own chairs would feel a sense of destiny, especially since they’d need billions of dollars to see their mission through, but that was the vibe in Anthropic’s early days. “The strangest thing about all of this is how inevitable so much of it felt to people on the inside,” Clark says. “We've done scaling laws. We could see the path to the models getting good.” Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt was among Anthropic’s first investors. He’d met Amodei through his then-girlfriend and now wife, who Schmidt knew socially. The two talked technology when Amodei was still at OpenAI, and business when he started Anthropic. Schmidt tells me he invested in the person more than the concept. “At this level, when you're doing an investment like that, you have essentially no data, right?” he says. “You don't know what the revenue is. You don't know the market. You don't know what the product is. And so you fundamentally have to decide based on the people. And Dario is a brilliant scientist, and he promised to hire brilliant scientists, which he did. He promised to lead a very small company doing it, which he did not. Now it's a very large company, and now it's a normal company. I figured it would be a very interesting research lab.” This story took months to report — made possible by our subscribers.

Now-disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was also among Anthropic’s early investors, directing a reported $500 million from FTX’s coffers for a 13.56% stake in the company. Bankman-Fried was one of a number of effective altruists who invested in Anthropic’s early stages, when the movement and company were close. Amodei says SBF was an AI bull interested in safety, a good fit, but had sufficient red flags to keep him off the board and give him non-voting shares. SBF’s behavior, Amodei says, “turned out to be much, much, much more extreme and bad than I ever imagined.” Amodei’s pitch to prospective investors was simple: He told them Anthropic had the talent to build cutting-edge models at a tenth of the cost. And it worked. To date, Amodei’s brought in nearly $20 billion, including $8 billion from Amazon and $3 billion from Google. “Investors aren't idiots,” he tells me. “They basically understand the concept of capital efficiency.” In Anthropic’s second year, OpenAI introduced generative AI to the world with ChatGPT, but Anthropic took a different path. Rather than focus on consumer applications, Amodei decided Anthropic would sell its technology to businesses. There were two benefits to this strategy. If the models were useful it could be lucrative, and the challenge would prod the company into building better technology. Improving an AI model from undergrad to graduate level in biochemistry might not excite the common chatbot user, Amodei says, but it would be valuable to a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer. “It gives a better incentive to develop the models as far as possible,” he says. Oddly enough, it was an Anthropic consumer product that got businesses to pay attention to its technology. The company released its Claude chatbot in July 2023, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut, and it drew rave reviews due to its high-EQ personality (an outgrowth of Anthropic’s safety work). The company, until then, had sought to remain under 150 employees, but soon found itself hiring more people in a day than it employed in total in its entire first year. “It was that Claude chatbot moment when the company started to grow a lot,” Clark says. Amodei’s bet on building AI for business use cases attracted loads of eager customers. Anthropic’s now sold its large language models across multiple industries — travel, healthcare, financial services, insurance, and more — including to leaders like Pfizer, United Airlines, and AIG. The Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk is, for instance, using Anthropic to condense a fifteen-day regulatory report compilation process into ten minutes. “The technology we've built ends up taking care of a lot of the stuff that people complain the most about their work,” Kate Jensen, Anthropic’s head of revenue, tells me. Coders, meanwhile, have fallen in love with Anthropic. The company focused on AI code generation both because it could help speed its model development and because coders would adopt it quickly if it worked well enough. Sure enough, the use cases exploded and have coincided with — or caused — the rise of AI coding tools like Cursor. Anthropic is also getting into the coding application business itself. It released Claude Code, an AI coding tool, in February 2025. As AI usage booms, the company’s revenue is as well. “Anthropic’s revenue every year has grown 10x,” Amodei says. “We went from zero to $100 million in 2023. We went from $100 million to a billion in 2024. And this year, in this first half of the year, we've gone from $1 billion to I think, as of speaking today, it’s well above $4 [billion], it might be $4.5 [billion].” The last figure is annualized, or 12x the month’s revenue. Anthropic’s 8 and 9 figure deals have tripled in 2025 vs. 2024, the company says, and its business customers have spent 5x more on average. But Anthropic is spending a lot of money to train and run its models, raising questions about whether its business model is sustainable. The company is deeply unprofitable, expected to lose about $3 billion this year. And its gross margins have also reportedly lagged behind typical cloud software companies. Some of Anthropic’s customers are wondering if the company’s attempt to sort out its business is showing up in the product. One startup founder told me that while Anthropic is the best model for his use case, he can’t rely on it because it’s down too often. Amjad Masad, CEO of vibe coding company Replit, told me the cost to use its models has stopped coming down after a period of price decreases. Claude Code also just added additional rate limits after some developers used it so much it became bad business. Entrepreneur and developer Kieran Klaassen tells me that he got $6,000 worth of Claude API usage in one month for just the $200 Max subscription price. Klaassen says he’s run multiple Claude agents at a time. “The real limit comes in your mental capacity to switch from one to the other,” he says. Amodei says that as Anthropic’s models improve, customers will get a better deal if costs stay the same, effectively buying more intelligence per dollar. He also says that AI labs are just beginning to optimize for inference, or the act of using the models, which should lead to efficiency improvements. This is a place to pay attention. Multiple industry sources told me inference costs must drop for the business to make sense. Anthropic’s executives, in their interviews with me, suggest there are worse problems than high demand for your product. The open question is whether generative AI, and the scaling laws that propel it, will neatly follow other technology’s cost reduction curves, or whether it’s a novel technology with a novel cost. The only sure thing is it’ll take a lot more money to find out. At the beginning of 2025, Anthropic needed cash. The AI industry’s hunger for scale had catalyzed massive data center buildouts and compute deals. To support these undertakings, AI labs had repeatedly smashed startup fundraising records. And established companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon used their sizable profits and data centers to build their own models, turning up the pressure. Anthropic has a special imperative to build large. Without a powerhouse application like ChatGPT, where users come back out of habit, its models must lead in their use cases or risk being swapped out for a competitor. “In the corporate space, and especially in coding, there’s very clearly an advantage to be six months or a year ahead of the state of the art,” Box CEO Aaron Levie, an Anthropic customer, tells me. So the company turned to Ravi Mhatre, a veteran venture capitalist and partner at Lightspeed Ventures, to lead a $3.5 billion funding round. Mhatre used to write $5 or $10-million checks, but the one he was readying to cut would be among his firm’s largest. “Amazon went public with a $400 million market cap,” he tells me. “$400 million! Think about that today.” The fundraise was proceeding as planned when a cheap, competing AI model dropped seemingly out of thin air. The Chinese hedge fund High Flyer released DeepSeek R1, an open-source, capable, and efficient reasoning model that it priced forty times lower than its peers. DeepSeek shocked the business world and had multi-trillion-dollar CEOs tweeting Wikipedia articles to calm shareholders. By the time DeepSeek arrived, Mhatre had completed a full projection of why the AI models themselves, not the chatbots of the world, would generate the most value. He concluded that creating artificial intelligence capable of knowledge work would allow companies to have revenue ten times what the large cloud platforms bring in, leading to a total potential market of $15 to 20 trillion. “So then you work backwards and just say, at $60 billion or $100 billion, could you get a venture-style return? You absolutely could,” he says. “Sometimes it's about how you size the markets top-down.” DeepSeek’s arrival suggested that open source, efficient, almost-as-good models could challenge the incumbents, but Amodei didn’t see it that way. His greatest concern, he says, is whether any new model is better than Anthropic’s. If you can download the model’s designs, you still need to set it up on a cloud service and run it, he says, which takes skill and money. Amodei delivered a version of this argument to Mhatre and his colleagues at Lightspeed as the DeepSeek story took off, convincing them that some of the model’s innovations could be improved with scale. That Monday, Nvidia stock dropped 17% as panicked investors fled the AI infrastructure trade. Amid the uncertainty, the VC made a decision. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful,” Mhatre says. “That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” Six months after DeepSeek Monday, Anthropic is looking to scale up yet again. The company is in talks for a new funding round that could reach $5 billion which would double its valuation to $150 billion. The potential investors include some middle eastern Gulf states that Anthropic once seemed eager to steer clear of. But after raising nearly $20 billion from Google, Amazon, and VCs like Lightspeed, it’s running out of options for bigger checks. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful. That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” - Ravi Mhatre Within Anthropic, Amodei has argued the Gulf states have $100 billion or more in capital to invest, and their cash would help Anthropic stay on the technology’s frontier. He seemed to reluctantly accept the idea of taking the money from dictators in an internal Slack message obtained by Wired. “Unfortunately,” he wrote. “I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Speaking with Amodei makes me wonder how, or if, this race to improve AI will end. I imagine the models might eventually get so big, and so good, they commoditize. Or perhaps, as Amodei’s former colleague Ilya Sutskever once suggested, the endless drive to scale ends up covering the planet with solar panels and datacenters. There’s also another possibility, one AI believers don’t like to discuss: AI improvement plateaus, leading to a historic investor wipeout. At Anthropic’s first developer conference in May, I grab a seat a few rows from the stage and await Amodei’s appearance. The company’s packed The Midway — an airy arts and events venue in San Francisco’s Dogpatch neighborhood — with coders, press, and many of its now 1,000+ employees. There’s broad anticipation inside that Anthropic will release Claude 4, its latest, biggest model. Amodei takes the stage and introduces Claude 4. Instead of a flashy presentation, he picks up a handheld mic, makes the announcement, reads his notes from a laptop, and then turns the spotlight over to Anthropic product head Mike Krieger. The crowd seems into it. Amodei’s promise of what’s coming next, to me, is more notable than the model update itself. Throughout the day, he repeatedly mentions that AI development is speeding up, and that Anthropic’s next model releases will come faster. “I don't know exactly how much more frequent,” he says. “But the pace is increasing,” Anthropic, as Amodei’s told me, has been developing AI coding tools to speed up its model development. When I bring this up to Jared Kaplan, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, he tells me it’s working. “Most engineers at Anthropic use AI to help them be more productive,” he says. “So it's definitely speeding us up quite a bit.” There’s a concept in AI theory called an intelligence explosion, where the model is able to make itself better and then — fffffoooooom — self-improves and become all mighty. Kaplan doesn’t dismiss the notion that an intelligence explosion might arrive via this method, or perhaps a human-assisted version. “It could be two or three years away. Could take longer. Could take much longer,” Kaplan says. “But when I say there’s a 50% chance of AI being able to do all the things that knowledge workers do, one of the things we do is train AI models.” “Maybe people like me won't really have much to do,” Kaplan continues. “It's more complicated than that. But we are quite likely headed towards the future that looks like that.” Amodei’s safety obsession, at this point, comes into clear focus. While nobody within Anthropic says an intelligence explosion is imminent, it’s evident they’re not shying away from moving toward it. If AI is going to get better, faster — and perhaps much faster — it’s worth being careful about its downsides. Some of this theoretical talk clearly helps Anthropic market its services to pharmaceutical companies and developers, but AI models are now coding well enough that it no longer feels completely insane. Jan Leike, the former head of OpenAI’s ‘Superalignment’ team, followed Amodei to Anthropic in 2024 to co-lead its alignment science team. Alignment is the art of tuning AI systems to ensure they are aligned with our values and goals. And Leike believes syncing the machines with our intentions will be crucial should we see the anticipated eruption. “There could be a period of rapid capability progress,” Leike tells me. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” Already, Anthropic and its counterparts have found AI sometimes demonstrates a worrying interest in self-preservation while testing in simulation environments. In Claude 4’s documentation, for instance, Anthropic stated the model repeatedly attempted to blackmail an engineer to avoid being shut down. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” - Jan Leike Anthropic’s also said its AI has worked to deceive evaluators when it thought they might rewrite its values. The model also attempted to copy itself out of Anthropic’s infrastructure in a simulation. Leike says Anthropic is working to discourage these behaviors via reward systems. The field is still experimental. Speaking openly about these issues is part of Amodei’s “race to the top” strategy. Anthropic’s also funded — and advocated for — interpretability, or the science of understanding what takes place within AI models. And it’s published a Responsible Scaling Policy, a framework that sets boundaries for when to release and train models depending on their risks, which has inspired similar efforts among its peers. “The way I think about the race to the top is that it doesn't matter who wins,” Amodei says. “Everyone wins, right?” Amodei’s dedication to AI, forged in the tragedy of his father’s loss, may now have its goal in sight. Today’s AI is already speeding up drug development paperwork, it’s become an (imperfect) medical advisor in a broken medical system, and, if things go right, it may one day stand in for those hundreds or thousands of researchers needed to understand human biology. Could Amodei’s pursuit of this vision, I ask, blind him to the risks of losing control of the technology? “That's not the way I think about it,” he says. “We've gotten better at controlling models with every model that we release. All these things go wrong, but you really have to stress test the models pretty hard.” Amodei sees this line of questioning as rooted in the slow-it-down doomerism he’s often accused of. His plan, contrary to the critics, is to accelerate. “The reason I'm warning about the risk is so that we don't have to slow down,” he says. “I have such an incredible understanding of the stakes. In terms of the benefits, in terms of what it can do, the lives that it can save. I've seen that personally.” Owen Lavine contributed reporting. Demis Hassabis stares intently through the screen when I ask him whether he can save Google. It’s early evening in his native U.K. and the DeepMind founder is working overtime.

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Fears of AI taking over jobs is already becoming a reality in tech. Fears of artificial intelligence costing people their jobs are already proving to be true. Or at the very least, CEOs are now admitting to the technology’s impact as AI-related layoffs ramp up, especially in the tech industry, reports Forbes’ Richard Nieva. Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman is just the latest to say out loud that AI is already a threat to all kinds of jobs—including his. In an April memo to his 1,200 employees, he wrote: “AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it’s coming for my job too.” “I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, ‘Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?’” Kaufman tells Forbes now. “I felt like this needed validation from me—that they aren’t imagining stuff.” He joins the likes of Andy Jassy at Amazon, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Shopify’s Tobi Lutke in admitting that AI will replace humans in white-collar jobs, some going as far as predicting a “white-collar bloodbath.” The impacts are already being felt, particularly for young coders and entry-level workers. The total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25 has dropped “slightly” since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT, said Ruyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. But not everything can, or should, be automated just yet. Take the buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, for example, which last year slashed its workforce by 40% in part to the company’s investments in AI. A year later, it launched a massive recruiting push for human customer service agents. “We have noticed that in a world where everything is automated,” Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom told Forbes, “people put a premium on the human experience.” Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. Why mastering “systems-thinking” skills could protect your job from AI. What to do when someone is hired above you. Amid all the hype, here’s why you may not need an AI agent.

Title: Wall Street is bullish on Meta's Q2 performance ahead of its earnings report: 'One of the best AI opportunity stocks'

Meta's strong earnings sent its stock soaring after hours as CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company's all-in approach to the AI race. The company also made it clear that competing in the AI talent war comes with a hefty price tag. Meta's second-quarter results handily beat analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings per share. Revenue was $47.52 billion, compared to expectations of $44.83 billion. Earnings per share were $7.14, compared to estimates of $5.89. Meta shares were up over 12% in after-hours trading during the analyst call, hitting $780, which would represent an all-time high for the stock. In a reference to Meta's recent AI hiring spree, the company cited employee compensation for "technical talent in priority areas" as its second-largest driver in cost growth, behind infrastructure expenses. Zuckerberg took a bit of a victory lap after the launch of his new Superintelligence Lab, which is run by Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang — a hiring made possible by Meta's eye-watering $15 billion investment in the startup. "We're building an elite, talent-dense team," he said. "I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter." He referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, now chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The Meta CEO is clearly bullish on the idea of leaner AI divisions, praising "the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." The company also gave updates on its hit AI Ray-Bans, sales of which are "accelerating" and helped drive a revenue increase of nearly 5% for the Reality Labs division. Zuckerberg said that glasses will be "the ideal form factor for AI," echoing his vision he outlined in a letter earlier in the day about "personal superintelligence." On the advertising front, Meta CFO Susan Li said that nearly 2 million advertisers have used the company's AI video generation and image tools. Scroll on for the highlights from Meta's analyst call: Analysts are pleased with Meta's results. William Blair analysts titled their post-earnings note "Massive Quarter Fueled by AI Advancements" and shared key reasons for their optimism. "The company is demonstrating that it can profitably scale the business while making massive capital investments," they wrote. "We continue to be positive on its AI adoption and benefits to advertisers and believe Meta will be a long-term AI leader. RBC analysts called Meta's performance a "Strong Q2" and highlighted how the company delivered 22% revenue growth at the "high-end of guidance and expectations." And Wedbush's tech analyst Dan Ives, a perennial tech bull, used four emojis — fire, trophy, bull, and popcorn — to express his approval in a post on X. "We have been talking about the AI Revolution for years but tonight was a night the tech world and the Street will remember for a long time," he wrote. "The jaw dropping numbers from Redmond and Meta speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of hyper growth," he added, referring to Microsoft and Meta results. "I think in the future, if you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you'd probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people," Zuckerberg says. Glasses will be the "ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together," he predicts, mentioning the metaverse. (Note: This appears to be the only mention of the "metaverse" in the earnings call; many people will remember when the metaverse was a big buzzword in Meta's earnings. Looks like that's "superintelligence" now.) Meta's stock is trading up 12% to $778 after hours, a record level for the company. Zuckerberg talks about the smaller size of Meta's new Superintelligence Labs team. It's an echo of what he's said about building lean teams focused on efficiency. He praises "the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." It breaks from how the company operates in other divisions, he notes. "If you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we can very productively have many hundreds or 1000s of people basically working on improving those systems," he says. "But I think for this, for the leading research on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head." Zuckerberg says he doesn't believe his thinking on open-source has particularly changed. Zuckerberg expects to continue to ship open-source products, though there are some challenging considerations with open-sourcing at this scale, he says. "We're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use. So we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that," he says. The bottom line, Zuckerberg says, is he expects to continue to ship open-source products, but not every product will be — which he says is a continuation of Meta's approach to open-source. "There's just a very high chance it seems like the world is going to look pretty different in a few years from now," Zuckerberg notes. "The more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen." The stock price hits $771 as questions with Wall Street analysts begin. Li says the company continues to focus on head count growth in its "highest priority areas." "We've had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and product initiatives," she says. Turning to AI-related infrastructure costs, Meta also expects to "ramp our investments significantly in 2026" for infrastructure. "Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video generation features, image animation, and video expansion, and we're seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new features," CFO Susan Li says. In the second quarter, the company started testing AI-powered translations to 10 different languages, she adds. Meta says Reality Labs revenue, its segment that includes its AI hardware as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets, is up nearly 5% — thanks to sales of its AI Ray-Bans. Zuckerberg says that he thinks AI glasses will be "the main way" that the company integrates personal superintelligence into people's daily lives. The Meta CEO says the company has built an "elite" team of AI researchers and engineers, highlighting the hire of Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who leads the new lab. "We're building an elite, talent-dense team," he said. "I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter." He also referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The company has noted in its earnings release that employee compensation for adding technical talent in "priority areas" (read AI) is its second-greatest driver of cost growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is on the call, along with CFO Susan Li. "Meta's blowout earnings and raised guidance highlight how AI is becoming a real revenue driver, not just hype," said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. "From ad targeting to content discovery, Meta is showing how to deploy AI at scale — and Wall Street is rewarding it. The company's continued heavy investment in AI infrastructure signals it's playing the long game and betting big on foundational models and compute power." Minda Smiley, senior analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider, said the company's strong quarter shows it "not only weathered but perhaps even benefitted from economic instability in recent months" and that the digital ads market more broadly "might not yet feel the pain from tariffs, though that could change." And while Meta continues pouring money into its AI ambitions, "Meta's exorbitant spending on its AI visions will continue to draw questions and scrutiny from investors who are eager to see returns," Smiley said. The company revised its ranges on total expenses and capital expenditures it forecasts for 2025, narrowing its estimates. Its total expense outlook, previously $113 to $118 billion, is now $114 to $118 billion for the year. (That's growth of 20 to 24% year-over-year.) Meta also narrowed its capex range, from $64 to $72 billion previously to $66 to $72 billion for the year. It says it also expects "another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026." Those AI talent wars you've been reading about? They're real — and expensive — Meta says. Not in those words, exactly. But that's clearly what the company is getting at in today's note to investors, where it acknowledged that all that spending is indeed going to show up on its financial statements. "While we are still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate," Meta said. "The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet." "Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas," Meta added. That said, Meta says its overall organization got smaller in the last quarter. It currently employs 75,945 people, down about 1% from the 76,834 it reported in Q1. —Peter Kafka Second quarter Advertising rev. $46.56 billion, +21% y/y, estimate $44.07 billion Family of Apps revenue $47.15 billion, +22% y/y, estimate $44.4 billion Reality Labs revenue $370 million, +4.8% y/y, estimate $386 million Other revenue $583 million, +50% y/y, estimate $500.6 million Operating income $20.44 billion, +38% y/y, estimate $17.24 billion Family of Apps operating income $24.97 billion, +29% y/y, estimate $22.16 billion Reality Labs operating loss $4.53 billion, +0.9% y/y, estimate loss $4.86 billion Average price per ad +9% vs. +10% y/y, estimate +7.58% Source: Bloomberg data Meta's hardware sales could be key to watch in light of some new developments since the company's last earnings call. In June, Zuckerberg unveiled new Oakley Meta glasses, similar to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses but branded as "performance AI glasses" geared toward athletes. Earlier this week, EssilorLuxottica, which makes Ray-Ban and Oakley, said revenue from sales of Meta's Ray-Bans more than tripled year-over-year. Wall Street was impressed with Meta's demo of its Orion augmented reality glasses prototype in September, though the glasses aren't expected to launch to consumers before 2027. Any update on the expected timeline for the more advanced AI smart glasses, which included integrated displays in the lenses, would be of interest to investors. Meta stock edged 0.6% lower Wednesday afternoon as investors prepared to parse the company's quarterly results. Shares of the tech giant are up 19% year-to-date. You can expect AI to be a heavy focus on this earnings call. (What else is new?) The company is allocating billions in capital expenditures toward infrastructure, talent, and other costs to support its AI ambitions. Meta has been in an all-out talent war for the biggest names in AI, poaching some competitors from rival firms with million-dollar bonuses. The company in June announced a new AI division called Superintelligence Labs. The company took a 49% stake in Scale AI for nearly $15 billion to make Scale founder Alexandr Wang Meta's new chief AI officer. — Sarah Jackson Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, wrote this month that investors will likely be most interested in three things heading into Meta's earnings call: Still, Zino said he expects Meta to meet its expected revenue targets for the second and third quarters, largely due to increased stability in the digital ad market. CFRA reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $800 from $750, implying 12% upside from current levels. Zuckerberg kicked off the company's earnings day by sharing his vision on superintelligence, which he believes is "now in sight." His memo Wednesday outlined his hope for a future where everyone has "a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals." "Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," he wrote. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices." (Of course, it's worth noting that Meta sells various smart glasses.) — Sarah Jackson Meta could lift its capital expenditures even higher as it ploughs more money into AI and superintelligence projects, analysts at Citizens wrote. "With Meta making material investments in its superintelligence team, including researchers and compute, we believe the company is going through a significant investment cycle and we expect 2026 CapEx to surprise the Street as Meta builds multiple 1GQ or greater data centers," they said, estimating capex could come in around $91 billion next year. Stocks typically don't benefit when a company is going through an investment cycle, analysts said, but the situation could be different for Meta, as AI can enhance the ad experience for users. The firm reiterated its "Market Outperform" rating and $750 price target on the stock, implying 5% upside from current levels. Needham had a mixed view of Meta headed into its second-quarter earnings. On the one hand, the firm's analysts upgraded their rating for the stock from "Underperform" to "Hold," citing two positive catalysts: Still, the firm sees a few risks ahead that held it back from rating the stock a "buy." Those include pressure on Meta's margins and free-cash flow, potentially higher-than-expected total labor costs due to stock-based compensation, and Meta's use of several strategies in its business, which "wastes capital and adds risks," analysts said. Oppenheimer said it sees a handful of risks looming for Meta stock. Oppenheimer reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $775 a share, implying 9% upside from current levels. Bank of America called Meta a "Top Online ad stock" for 2025 in a note this month. That's because the company looks best-positioned to reap the benefits from AI-driven advertising, analysts wrote, which they believe could support a higher valuation for the stock. In a separate note, analysts said they expected Meta to beat consensus estimates for second-quarter earnings, pointing to positive checks the bank conducted on Meta's advertising business. Revenue could come in around $45.5 billion, they estimated, at the higher end of Meta's guidance for the quarter. The bank reiterated its "Buy" rating on Meta. Earlier this month, it lifted its price target for the stock to $775 from $765, which implies 9% upside from current levels. Second Quarter Third Quarter Full year Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

I’m back from vacation: It was nice (thanks for asking). I’ve returned to better weather. Today, it’ll be sunny with a balmy high of 81. Temperatures will drop to the high 50s tonight before heating back up tomorrow. Expect a slight chance of rain Thursday into Thursday night. Friday should be a pleasant, partly cloudy day in the low- to mid-70s. Dead Heat: Katie Wilson and Bruce Harrell are statistically tied in the mayor’s race a week before the primary election. It’s a limited sample (651) with a 4.1 percent margin of error, but still, this race is not a cakewalk for Harrell. He’ll have to fight to break the curse of the one-term mayor. His campaign seems to be betting on making Wilson, a quite normal woman, out to be a society-restructuring radical (after all, Stalin also said Seattle pizza was too expensive). Those awkward TikToks might come in handy. Welcome Back? Debora Juarez is back in her old City Council seat for the next 16 months, replacing Cathy Moore after her resignation earlier this month. For recent transplants and the generally forgetful, Juarez used to be council president. Mexican American and a member of the Blackfeet Nation, Juarez was the first Indigenous person in that role. In a press release, Chief Seattle Club, Seattle Indian Health Board, Seattle Indian Services Commission, and United Indians of All Tribes Foundation celebrated her appointment. “Debora Juarez has long embodied the power, resilience, and vision of Indigenous leadership,” the release read. While charmingly foul-mouthed, Juarez is a conservative who fits right into the current brat pack. She’s also known for being somewhat unpredictable. It’s interesting that she applied for the vacancy—she made clear that she was tired of the job when she decided not to run for reelection in 2023—but since throwing her hat into the ring, her appointment has been expected. Juarez received 7 votes. Alexis Mercedes Rinck voted for Nilu Jenks, a former candidate for District 5. Ferg Down: Washington voters think Governor Bob Ferguson sucks. A Monday Cascade PBS/Elway poll found his approval rating at the sixth month mark is the lowest for a Washington Governor since 1993. Of the 403 registered voters surveyed, 32 percent consider Ferguson to be doing a “good” or “excellent” job. That’s eight points lower than Gov. Inslee, 11 points below Christine Gregoire, and 20 points below Gary Locke at the same point in their first terms. Almost the same percentage of people (31 percent) think he’s doing a “poor” job; 22 percent rated his job performance as “fair.” Damn, dude. According to Cascade, people are angry that Ferguson is signing off on new taxes, that he’s cut spending, that he’s too focused on President Donald Trump’s administration, that he’s not focused enough on Trump, that he’s too in line with Democrats, and that he’s too moderate. You can’t please everyone all of the time, but Ferguson’s middling centerism seems to please nobody. Now to HMW for the latest on Denny Blaine. Thanks For Nothing: The City submitted its “abatement plan” for Denny Blaine Park on Monday evening. No one is thrilled about its idea to divide the already small beach into a nude area (closest to the water) and a clothed area (the vast majority of the park). “Zoning” Denny Blaine isn’t a new idea. Last year, the Parks Department proposed a nudity DMZ at the parking lot—much further back than the current abatement plan. When it was submitted for public comment, beach goers roundly rejected it because they felt it made a concession to neighbors they didn’t have to make. (This is where we remind you, dear reader, for the hundredth time, that nudity is legal in Seattle.) The city is also planning to increase the presence of park rangers and signage to the park. Sophie Amity Debs, who co-runs the park stewardship group Friends of Denny Blaine, told The Stranger that by cutting the space down to a tiny sliver of the park, the city is “not setting themselves up for success with having people respect and take these guidelines seriously.” This proposal isn’t the worst case scenario. “We are glad that it doesn't just outright ban nudity, because that was one of our big fears … and we are also glad that the enforcement mechanisms are via park rangers and not by SPD.” Back to me :)! Firefighters Saving a Rainforest: The human-caused Bear Gulch fire (first reported July 6, wonder how that started?) is creeping toward the Staircase area of Olympic National Park. The 1,100 acre fire is only 10 percent contained, the Seattle Times reports. Two hundred people, including firefighters, are assigned to this fire. Big Beautiful Electric Bills? Lawmakers say the cuts to renewable energy in President Donald Trump's Beautiful Bill will raise the price of electricity in Washington. As it turns out, massive public infrastructure projects are not optional or spontaneous. They’re important and planned decades in advance. Cities are growing, transmission lines are aging, and AI data centers are siphoning off our excess power to animate photos of dead grandparents at a time heatwaves are more likely to hit California and Washington simultaneously. We can’t just pause this work, cross our fingers and hope the power stays on. We’ll still have to pay for repairs, new energy projects, and extra power with our money. Seattle City Light CEO Dawn Lindell says people “can expect to see significant rate increases for probably the next 10 to 12 years.” The US Department of Energy did not respond to KUOW’s request for comment. Suspect Arrested For Shooting Lummi Nation Officer: Authorities arrested the 26-year-old suspect and Whatcom county resident for investigation of attempted murder yesterday afternoon. Early Monday morning, the officer responded to a call for a vehicle in a ditch in Lummi Nation west of Bellingham. The driver shot the officer and fled on foot. It’s unclear where and how the suspect was apprehended, but multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the search. The officer was rushed into surgery. As of Monday afternoon, the officer was alive and receiving medical care. Northgate Shooter: Police say they're still searching for two suspects they say shot a man in the back of the head outside the Northgate Transit Center on Monday morning. The victim, 48, was in critical condition as of Monday afternoon. Over 60,000 Killed in Gaza Since October 7: Gaza’s ministry of health puts the total at 60,034. At least 62 have been killed since dawn, reports Al Jazeera, 19 of them aid seekers. Yesterday, two of the most-known Israeli rights groups (B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights —Israel) called the genocide a genocide for the first time. This morning, the UK announced that it would recognize a Palestinian state if Israel doesn't reach a ceasefire with Hamas by September. Shooter Killed Four in Midtown Manhattan: After much unverified online speculation that gunman Shane Tamura had targeted the investment company Blackstone, police say the three-page note found in his wallet indicates Tamura had likely targeted NFL headquarters. Police say Tamura claimed he suffered from CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, from playing football and accused the NFL of concealing the danger to players. Tamura shot himself in the chest. “Study my brain please,” police say he wrote. “I’m sorry.” CTE is a serious condition that increases the risk of suicide. It can only be diagnosed in an autopsy. One study of 2,000 former NFL players published in JAMA Neurology found 1 in 3 believed they had CTE. FIGHT! Paul Dans, a chief architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, is challenging Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican party’s most eligible bachelor. Dans, who looks like something bad happened to Mark Cuban (the Portrait of Mark Cuban?), is expected to formally announce his campaign in Charleston this Wednesday. Chris LaCivita, advisor to Sen. Graham’s campaign and co-manager of Trump’s presidential bid, ominously told the AP that Dans’ campaign would “end prematurely.” Thanks, Chris. Strange and threatening! Not Even Capitalism Safe From ICE Raids: The New York Times reports that work has slowed to a crawl at one Omaha, Nebraska meatpacking plant. Three weeks after ICE came to Glenn Valley Foods with a battering ram and a warrant for 107 workers, production is down by 70%. Half of the maintenance crew is being deported. About 50 workers are in ICE detention. Owner Gary Rohwer told the Times it was a “wipeout.” We don’t need the lens of capitalism to grasp the injustice of ICE abductions, but the bottom line is often the only thing that reaches Americans. *SCREECH*: Two whistleblowers have accused Emil Bove, former defense attorney for President Donald Trump, current top official at the Justice Department, and nominee for the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, of directing Justice Department staff to ignore federal court orders in the way of Trump’s mass deportation plans. A third says he lied to Senators during his confirmation hearing last month. The Senate is expected to vote on his appointment this week. A Tune for You: Thanks, MJ Lenderman. I love to do dishes to your music. Editor's Note: A previous version of this article said that people had speculated that the shooter in Manhattan had targeted Blackrock in the Midtown building. The building is home to the Blackstone offices. Vivian McCall is a staff writer for The Stranger covering queer culture and politics in Seattle and beyond.

Title: This Week In Bitcoin: 4 Things To Keep An Eye On That Could Impact Price
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/this-week-in-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T16:30:07Z
Full Content:
As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in a volatile yet increasingly bullish market, a crypto analyst points to key developments that could drive a breakout past $130,000. From macroeconomic shifts to major technical breakouts and unexpected geopolitical tailwinds, the analyst outlines four critical factors to watch this week that could significantly impact BTC’s price action. On July 27, crypto analyst Doctor Profit posted a detailed macro report on X social media, highlighting Bitcoin and certain bullish events unfolding around it. Before addressing the latest US trade developments, the market expert noted that Bitcoin recently pulled off a major technical move that went largely unnoticed by the market. After facing four consecutive months of rejection from November 2024 to February 2025, BTC finally broke through a long-term diagonal resistance tied to its 2021 all-time high. It then retested the level as support and followed through with a strong bullish move. On the macro front, Doctor Pillows suggested that a significant shift in the global trade policy could fuel Bitcoin’s continued upward momentum. He highlighted President Donald Trump’s announcement of a landmark trade agreement between the US and European Union, easing fears of a potential tariff war. The analyst described this deal as one of the most bullish trade agreements since 2016, noting that markets are likely to respond positively to the reduced geopolitical risks. With stocks set to open higher and economic friction easing between two of the world’s largest economies, Bitcoin also stands to benefit from the improved macro environment. Earlier this week, Bitcoin saw a brief drop to $114,500 after wallet activity from Galaxy Digital sparked concerns of a potential selloff. However, according to Doctor Profit, those fears quickly faded as spot ETF inflows continued to outpace Bitcoin’s daily issuance. Institutions like BlackRock are also steadily absorbing supply, reinforcing strong underlying demand. Most importantly, the analyst highlighted that many long-term whale wallets remain inactive, indicating that the broader accumulation trend is still intact. Rather than signaling weakness, Doctor Profit suggests that the recent price dip appeared to have been a temporary shakeout that highlights the strength of the ongoing bull market. In his report, Doctor Profit stated that Bitcoin’s real macro engine is emerging from M2 Money Supply growth. Despite ongoing narratives around quantitative tightening, the analyst highlights that M2 has risen by 2.3% in 2025 so far, including a sharp 0.63% spike between May and June— the largest monthly increase this year. Historically, Bitcoin has closely followed M2 expansion, as seen during the 2020 liquidity surge that fueled an 800% rally. While exact outcomes vary, Doctor Profit suggests that the current pace of growth points to a potential 15-17.5% BTC rally to above $130,000 in the coming weeks, based on the cryptocurrency’s typical 60-90 day lag in reacting to monetary expansion. As his final bullish point, Doctor Profit mentioned the next FOMC meeting on Wednesday. While the official stance remains “hawkish,” with only a 5% chance of a rate cut, the analyst noted that the Federal Reserve (FED) has been quietly expanding liquidity and printing. This growing disconnect between Chair Jerome Powell’s rhetoric and the FED’s actual monetary actions is noteworthy. It suggests that the FED may already be laying the groundwork for the next round of quantitative easing. Given Bitcoin’s historical sensitivity to monetary policy shifts, the cryptocurrency may be well-positioned to rally significantly once the pivot becomes more apparent.

The Minnesota-based Ethereum treasury firm, which began the month holding 198,200 ETH, now controls 438,200 ETH, an 121% increase in four weeks, according to a press release. Based on recent prices, that stockpile was worth $1.4 billion on Tuesday, the second largest among corporate Ethereum treasuries. SharpLink aims to increase shareholder value by boosting the amount of Ethereum it owns per fully diluted share. The company consistently issued common stock as a way to fund purchases in July, in addition to raising cash through a private placement last month. Last week, SharpLink said it purchased 77,200 Ethereum, “maintaining its aggressive acquisition pace.” In July, SharpLink gained $852 million from issuing nearly 45 million common shares, capturing a premium that its stock trades at relative to its crypto holdings, mirroring elements of Strategy’s Bitcoin-buying playbook. SharpLink said that the Ethereum it holds per 1,000 assumed diluted shares issued and outstanding, a metric dubbed “ETH Concentration,” increased to 3.4, as of Sunday, from 2.29 three weeks prior. Leveraging Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus model, the company said that it has generated 722 Ethereum worth $2.8 million since it pivoted away from sports gambling marketing. Nearly all the Ethereum SharpLink owns has been devoted to staking protocols, allowing the company to earn rewards by helping validate Ethereum transactions. Ethereum’s price rose above $3,900 on Monday before retreating, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Although the asset’s price has increased 60% over the past month, momentum has cooled over the past week, with the asset around 21% away from its pandemic-era high of $4,900. SharpLink shares have tumbled 31% over the past week to $18.82 as Ethereum’s price has lost momentum; however, the stock is still up 100% over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance. In May, SharpLink’s stock price soared to $124 before plummeting on profit-taking among investors that participated in the company’s private placement. Ethereum software giant Consensys, known for its MetaMask digital wallet, said on Monday that SharpLink would be among firms stewarding the token for its Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Linea. The group, called the Linea Consortium, will help oversee 75% of its eventual supply. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That means SharpLink, which is chaired by Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, will help distribute tokens to grow the layer-2 network, alongside other members. SharpLink gaming is the second largest holder of Ethereum to join the Strategic Ethereum Reserve, a group of Ethereum-aligned entities. BitMine Immersion, which has pivoted its focus from Bitcoin mining, owns around 625,000 Ethereum, a sum worth roughly $2.4 billion. In July, SharpLink made other notable acquisitions, besides massive amounts of Ethereum. That included a former digital assets executive at BlackRock, Joseph Chalom, who was appointed co-CEO of SharpLink last week.

Title: Here's What Traders Expect Microsoft Stock To Do After Earnings

Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell today, with traders anticipating its stock could climb to all-time highs. Current options pricing suggests traders expect Microsoft stock could move nearly 4% in either direction from recent levels by the end of Friday’s trading session. A move of that scale would lift shares to a fresh record near $531 or drop them to about $494, about where they were at the start of July. The shares hovered around $512 in recent trading, just below Friday's closing high after setting multiple records earlier this month. Microsoft's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 5% over the past four quarters, falling in three of those instances. April was the exception, when shares jumped 8% the day after earnings as cloud and AI growth drove better-than-expected results. Ahead of Wednesday's earnings report, all 20 brokers covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have "buy" ratings for the stock. Their average price target around $580 represents a 13% premium over Tuesday's closing price just above $512. Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft’s quarterly revenue and profits to have surged year-over-year amid growing AI demand. Wedbush analysts, who recently raised their price target to $600, said the company "is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front," thanks to the adoption of Copilot, its chatbot, and its cloud-computing platform Azure. UPDATE—July 30, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent price values.

Title: Equities March Higher While Fed Asserts Its Independence

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Once again, equities rose for the week (ended July 25th) with the S&P 500 up nearly 1.5%, the Nasdaq just over 1.0%, the Dow just under 1.3%, and even small cap stocks participated (Russell 2000 +0.9%).1 The month to date numbers are positive for each index in the +1.4% to +4.0% range. 2025 year to date appears to be favoring the tech heavy indexes (S&P 500 and Nasdaq) but not so much the old-time industrials (DJIA) or small caps (Russell 2000). Six of the Magnificent 7 rose on the week with Tesla (TSLA -4.1%) the only laggard.2 Microsoft (MSFT) closed on Friday at a new record high and Nvidia posted a new high on Thursday (July 24th). It’s been quite a run for stocks since the April lows. Two stocks that don’t seem to be participating are Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). Apple is off its high by more than -17% and Tesla twice that (-34%).2 And both are off double digits year to date. The table shows that three of the seven (NVDA, MSFT, and META) are up more than 20% this year. Amazon and Google are also up, but in the single digit range.2 Meanwhile, the White House has reached an agreement with Japan, setting tariffs on Japanese imports at 15%.1 Markets reacted positively to that news and now await word on negotiations with the European Union (EU), the results of which appear to be coming shortly. The economies in the EU are softening and the European Central Bank (ECB) has moved their policy rate to 2%, the mid-point of their neutral range. Unlike the ECB, the Fed’s current reference rate (the Fed Funds Rate), at 4.25% to 4.50%, is significantly above the Fed’s stated 2% neutral rate.3 The Fed appears to have some catching-up to do. We don’t have to review the political theater that has been playing out between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell as it’s been all over the news. The independence of the Fed from a sitting Administration was written into the 1913 law establishing the Fed.4 [Imagine the economic damage and resulting inflation if sitting U.S. Presidents controlled the Fed!] The Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) whose next meeting is in the last week of July, is composed of 12 members. They are the seven members of the Board of Governors (nominated by the sitting President and confirmed by the Senate), the President of the NY Fed, and four of the eleven remaining Regional Federal Reserve Bank Presidents (on a rotating basis).5 Powell, while Chair and with a great deal of influence, is only one of the 12 votes on the FOMC. So even if Powell wanted to lower, it isn’t a slam dunk. The Fed knows that it takes several months for its policy changes to have a significant economic impact. A good example is mortgage rates. A lower Fed Funds Rate would likely push mortgage rates down, but the impact on the economy is slow (mortgage by mortgage). As noted below, housing has become slow, so, it would behoove the Fed to lower rates. Thus, as emerging data show a slowing economy, it is only fitting that they lower the Fed Funds Rate. But the Fed knows that its independence is of utmost importance. As a result, we expect the Fed to maintain the Fed Funds Rate where it is (4.25%-4.50%) at its late July meeting if for no other reason than to reassert its independence from the Administration. Markets agree. The Market’s odds of a rate decrease at the July meeting are a scant 2.6%.3 It is also clear that the President now realizes that he can’t force the Fed, that the Fed values its independence and will fight for it, and that if he wants lower interest rates, he will have to wait until the Fed’s September meeting (market odds of a September rate cut are 62%, as the market sees a softening economy making headline news at that time).3 Thus, it behooves the President to stop discussing monetary policy and lay off criticizing the Chairman. If that were to occur, and the Fed lowers in September, the economy would benefit. New home sales rose +0.6% in June to a 627K annual rate.6 But that’s where the good news ends. The consensus expectation was 650K, and the small rise in June barely dented the huge -11.6% falloff in May. The combined May/June performance was the worst two-month performance since late 2022. Inventory levels of those new, unsold, homes were at 9.8 months’ supply at existing sales rates, up from 8.5 months in April and 9.7 in May. As a result, the average price for new homes fell by -2.1% in June from May levels while the median price was off -4.9% from May and down -3.0% from a year ago. Things were no better in the existing home space. Home prices fell -2.7% in June from May levels and existing home sales are now below the levels that occurred at the beginning of the last three Recessions. So, this is a Big Deal! The months’ supply, at current sales rates, has risen from 3.5 months in February to 4.7 months currently, and Zillow reports that 25% of its listings reduced their asking price in June, the highest level for a June month since 2018. It is hard to not conclude that deflation is in the immediate future for residential real estate. Of greater concern here is that the value of that personal residence is the major asset for the vast majority of U.S. households, and lower values will impact future consumption via the “wealth effect,” i.e., consumers spend more/less when their net worth rises/falls. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) fell again in June (-0.3%), are down -4% from a year ago, and have been constantly negative for the past three years.7 While some may say these measures are obsolete, we still believe that they impart value to the overall economic picture. Currently, this index is at a ten-year low. It peaked in December 2021 and is down -17.8% since. The Philadelphia Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index came in at -10.3 for July (somewhat better than June’s -25.0, but still negative).8 It has been negative for nine months in a row, and its expectations index for six months hence, at -3.9, has also been negative for six months in a row. The Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index fell to -20 in July from -8 in June. Market expectations were for a -2 reading.9 And the Chicago Fed’s National Activity index (a model with 85 variables) showed up at -0.1 in June, negative now for three months in a row. Companies employing 100 or more must notify workers 60 days prior to layoffs. This is called Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN). Such notifications are up +23% over the past year. This means that weakness will be showing up in the employment data as the year progresses. Equity markets continue to march higher despite growing evidence of a slowing economy. Housing sales, both from new construction and from existing units have slowed precipitously and clearly need lower mortgage rates. Such rates are tied to the 10 Year Treasury yield. Other indicators show slippage in the economy. The Conference Board’s LEI, the Philly Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index, the Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index, and the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index have all been negative for several months. And higher layoffs appear to be just around the corner. Under normal circumstances, the Fed would be moving smoothly toward ease. But these aren’t “normal” times. Recent pressure by the White House on Chairman Powell has put the Fed’s independence in question and at risk. And, while the President has recently backed off, to put an exclamation point on the Fed’s independence, even at the risk of raising the odds of a Recession, it is highly likely that the Fed will not move rates lower at their late July meeting. The market’s odds of a July rate decrease recently fell to 2.6%!3 The next Fed meeting is in September. If the economy really deteriorates, there could be an inter-meeting move lower for the Fed Funds Rate, but that’s highly unlikely. So, as things now stand, the Fed’s next rate reduction will likely occur in September. Stay tuned. Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

So, as things now stand, the Fed’s next rate reduction will likely occur in September. Stay tuned. Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: Trump’s tariffs could squeeze U.S. factories and raise costs by up to 4.5%, a new analysis finds

Stand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on! Josh Boak, Associated Press Josh Boak, Associated Press Paul Wiseman, Associated Press Paul Wiseman, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. READ MORE: Big 3 automakers say Trump’s tariff deal with Japan puts them at a disadvantage “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there’s the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. READ MORE: Trump is getting the world economy he wants — but the risk to growth could spoil his victory lap Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn’t say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,” said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices” under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,” Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,”’ he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.” Stand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on!

Title: Future Of Warner Bros. International TV Production Revealed
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/07/warner-bros-international-tv-production-future-revealed-1236472938/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T14:44:21Z

By Jesse Whittock, Max Goldbart EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday unveiled its post-split leadership plan, but absent from the detail was any mention of the Warner Bros International Television Production studio. Although WBD’s American studios and production divisions are being folded into David Zaslav’s new Warner Bros. business, we can reveal that the London-based WBITVP will, in fact, fall under the Discovery Global biz, which will be led by current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. The separation is expected to close in mid-2026. We understand Warner Bros and Discovery are moving towards post-split agreements on Warner formats that WBITVP already sells on the international market. Watch on Deadline Several sources alerted Deadline to WBITVP’s post-split shift upon yesterday’s announcement, and a rep for WBD confirmed the decision. It may seem surprising that the international studio will now be separate from the likes of Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group and DC Studios, but insiders noted that the move is a logical one given that Discovery Global is international-facing. “One positive is it will have to be Euro-centric,” said one source in the continent. Furthermore, WBITVP already has a strong relationship with current WBD International President Gerhard Zeiler, who has become Discovery Global’s Chief Content Officer plus President in the U.S., UK and Germany. WBITVP President Ronald Goes is close with Zeiler, and the move allows the pair to continue working in lockstep, while continuing to work alongside Andy Zein, who is EVP Creative, Format Development and Sales. Sources said they expect more information on WBITVP’s post-split future in the coming days but downplayed the idea that there will be layoffs or mergers from within. One speculated that there may have been a tussle between Warner Bros. and Discovery Global over where WBITVP would sit. “It’s flattering that we aren’t just being shipped off, but it does seem right to be in this [Discovery Global] part of the business,” said the insider. WBITVP represents the rights to numerous Warner-created shows on the international market and makes the likes of The Bachelor, FBoy Island and Impractical Jokers via production hubs across Europe and in Australia and New Zealand. In the UK, it owns First Dates producer Twenty Twenty, Who Do You Think You Are? maker Wall to Wall and The Repair Shop indie Ricochet. Also among WBITVP’s catalog are 25 scripted formats, with several coming from the U.S., such as Gossip Girl, The O.C. and The Mentalist. WBITVP’s central team, which is primarily based in Old Street, London but also has staff in the U.S., has more than 50 employees on the books, according to its website. We understand WBITVP will be staying put at its current base, where it and CNN Worldwide, which is also moving to Discovery, are housed. Zeiler appeared a big winner out of yesterday’s post-split announcement. The WBD veteran has taken on the U.S. President role at Discovery Global, working closely with Wiedenfels at the top table on strategy. WBD LatAm and U.S. Hispanic boss Fernando Medin steps into his President of International shoes, and we understand his post will focus on territories elsewhere and finding new revenue streams for Discovery’s local businesses. The likes of U.S. Ad Sales President Ryan Gould, distribution boss Scott Miller and content strategy EVP Fulvia Nicoli will all report into Zeiler. Other notable international names moving to Discovery include Kasia Kieli, who has retained her role as President and MD, Poland and CEO of Polish network TVN. Following a period of intense speculation, the WBD split was revealed last month. The seismic move separates the company along similar lines to rival Comcast’s spinning out of its cable networks from NBCUniversal. Lionsgate’s split from Starz was confirmed in May. Broadly, the separation of studios and broadcast networks from cable business is seen by most leaders and analysts as part of future-proofing against an increasingly dominant set of digital-first rivals such as YouTube, Netflix and Amazon. Streaming’s rise and the continued decline of linear television have left investors confused and stock prices floundering, even with cable networks still posting very healthy profits. “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape,” Zaslav said at the time. Warner Bros’ former parent, WarnerMedia, and Discovery first united under the latter’s long-serving chief, Zaslav, in April 2022. This formed the WBD business, which is now set to break apart again.

What a waste of potentially combining worldwide production operations to support a worldwide expanding SVOD service. I always thought WBITVP did not fit Warner Bros. and this is a good move How did you come to that conclusion? So a SVOD rolling out internationally only cares about US productions on the service and not making local versions for their international audiences? ridiculous. Fat cats ruining a legacy studio all over again. and keep chasing the streamers, you will never catch Youtube nor Netflix. never. They should be reinventing their business model not constantly copying someone elses, poorly. These legacy studios deserve to crumble into dust. We workers abhor the hand that feeds us.

Title: 6 Top Nuclear Power Stocks And ETFs To Buy And Power Your Portfolio Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/6-best-nuclear-power-stocks-etfs-buy-now/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T14:37:12Z

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. As power hungry AI cloud services providers seek ever more energy, nuclear energy is enjoying a revival. While younger people who did not live through the near-meltdowns such as Chernobyl (1986) and Three Mile Island (1979) are bullish, the regulatory and financial barriers to building nuclear power plants remain formidable. Nevertheless, capital providers see these barriers as worth hurdling. With annual investment in nuclear power doubling to $60 billion since 2020, nuclear power could energize your portfolio. For example, Microsoft signed a 20-year agreement to use power from Three Mile Island, and Meta signed a similar deal with another nuclear power facility. To profit from this trend while considering the risks, read on for three publicly-traded stocks and three exchange traded funds which could rise along with demand for nuclear energy. With concerns about energy security and climate change on the rise, nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence. Roughly 400 reactors are now operating in 31 countries providing about 5% of the world’s electricity. What’s more, new nuclear reactors are being constructed. Of the 63 nuclear reactors being built, many deploy new technologies such as Small Modular Reactors – which are safer and smaller – and advanced Generation IV reactors, wrote Goldman Sachs. Another positive is the support for nuclear power from younger people who lack a direct memory of previous disasters and recognize nuclear’s “role in decarbonization efforts,” reports Strats Research. Nevertheless, nuclear faces significant challenges, including the following: Baltimore, Maryland-based Constellation Energy Corporation produces and sells electricity, natural gas, energy-related products and sustainable solutions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and other power regions. Constellation is a top choice because it is the largest operator of nuclear reactors in the United States and a major provider of carbon-free electricity. The company's focus on nuclear power provides a reliable source of baseload electricity and makes it an attractive partner for technology companies needing consistent power for data centers. For instance, Meta recently announced a 20-year nuclear agreement with Constellation. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corporation provides uranium through three segments: Uranium, Fuel Services and Westinghouse. The Uranium segment explores for, mines, mills, purchases and sells uranium concentrate. The Fuel Services segment refines, converts, and fabricates uranium concentrate. The Westinghouse segment makes nuclear reactor technology equipment and provides products and services to commercial utilities and government agencies, reported Yahoo! Finance. As one of the world's largest uranium producers, Cameco is a top choice because it is likely to benefit from increasing nuclear fuel demand. The company has substantial high-grade uranium reserves and long-term contracts with utility companies, providing a degree of stability. Cameco also has an ownership stake in Westinghouse Electric, providing exposure to nuclear reactor construction, according to SeekingAlpha. Corvallis, Oregon-based NuScale Power provides a small modular reactor technology system -- the NuScale Power Module. The NPM, a water reactor, can generate 77 megawatts of electricity. Founded in 2007, NuScale operates as a subsidiary of Fluor Enterprises, according to Yahoo! Finance. NuScale is a top choice due to the company’s leadership in SMR technology, which offers potential benefits in scalability, safety, and faster deployment compared to traditional large reactors. The company’s SMR design is the first to be certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, giving it a potential first-mover advantage in this emerging technology, according to 24/7 Wall Street. One year price change: 48.7% Top five holdings: The VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF The fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the fund's benchmark index of equity securities and depositary receipts issued by uranium and nuclear energy companies, according to Yahoo! Finance. The ETF is a top choice because it offers broader exposure to the nuclear energy sector beyond just uranium miners. It includes uranium miners, nuclear power plant builders and maintainers, nuclear electricity producers, and related equipment and technology. The fund's exposure to utilities can make a portfolio more defensive. One year price change: 50% Top five holdings: Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF normally invests in securities of nuclear fuel and energy – particularly in the areas of advanced reactors; utilities; construction and services; and/or fuel. Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities of nuclear companies. The ETF is a top choice because it tracks a custom index reflecting the nuclear industry broadly. It offers significant exposure to advanced reactor technology, including a large position in Oklo, which makes small modular reactors. NUKZ has shown strong performance and offers exposure to the developing advanced nuclear technology sector, according to TipRanks. One year price change: 54.6% Top five holdings: Global X Uranium ETF normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index that tracks the broad based equity market performance of global companies involved in the uranium industry, according to Yahoo! Finance. URA is a top choice because it is the largest and most popular nuclear ETF by assets under management. It provides broad exposure to the uranium and nuclear energy value chain, including uranium producers, nuclear component manufacturers and service providers. This ETF also offers direct exposure to the physical uranium commodity, which is unique among nuclear ETFs. Bottom Line With investment in nuclear power doubling over the last five years, should you invest in companies and ETFs that track its growth? Despite the risks of nuclear power – which include enormous capital requirements, regulatory and political hurdles and the risk of nuclear accidents – the stocks and ETFs highlighted above may offer upside opportunity. As long as large AI cloud services providers are eager to buy nuclear energy, these investments could enrich your portfolio

Title: Tariffs are already raising prices — here’s what to buy before another round of hikes

Skin Care Hair Care Oral Care Health Fitness Sleep Kitchen Appliances & Tools Small Home Appliances Bedding & Bath Office Outdoor Electronics Headphones Smart Gadgets Computers Dogs Cats Pet Care Luggage Accessories Packing & Organization Follow Select Zoe Malin Reporter It’s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don’t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1. Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don’t be surprised if you’re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there’s still time to save — tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren’t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year. Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money. Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter. We don’t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn’t mean you should panic buy — it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you’ve been saving up for. It’s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty. A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren’t shooting up. But it’s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We’re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again. Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too. Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They’re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties. During a recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble’s CEO said shoppers will start seeing price hikes from its brands this summer, including Tide, which has manufacturing plants in the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide. Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines. Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor. Apple makes most of its hardware in China and produces devices like iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods in India and Vietnam. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who tested Apple’s AirPods 4 for two months, says they’re a small, comfortable pair you can rely on daily. “These are the best earbuds for anyone who hates the feeling of rubber eartips clogging their eardrums,” he says. “They also have new features like dust and water resistance, and adaptive audio, which automatically switches between noise cancellation modes.” The JBL Clip 5, which is made in China, is our team’s go-to Bluetooth speaker — the audio quality is impressive for the device’s size, and its built-in carabiner clip lets you attach it to bags, bikes, beach umbrellas, bathroom towel rods and more. You can use the speaker for up to 12 hours before needing to recharge it, according to the brand. The Clip 5 is also dust- and water-resistant. While Nintendo didn’t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.” The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it’s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon — its price could increase at any point, and it’s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It’s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games. Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it’s Google’s best smartwatch yet, although it’s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon). It has fitness tracking features, including the ability to automatically log workouts and build custom runs. The water-resistant watch has a 24-hour battery life, according to the brand, and collects data about your sleep. I buy basics from Gap every time they’re on sale, including this 100% cotton T-shirt, which is made in India. The shirt has a soft, loose feel, short sleeves and a crewneck. It runs true-to-size, in my experience. I typically wear it tucked into a pair of jeans, and in the colder months, I throw a cardigan over it. These Levi’s jeans, available in men’s and women’s sizes, are produced in China, but the brand makes and sources apparel from across the world. “I’ve been wearing a pair of Levi’s 501’s for over 6 years now,” says NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman. “I love the classic, straight fit because it works for almost every outfit, and the cut is honestly timeless. There’s a reason these are one of most iconic pairs of denim of all time.” Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer. According to an earnings call, the hikes were “modest” and “strategic.” The brand didn’t specify exactly what products increased in price, or whether customers should expect additional increases in the future. Lululemon’s Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings are my all-time favorite pair for high-intensity workouts like running, as well as strength training. They have two side pockets, a hidden pocket in the waistband and a waistband drawcord. Adidas, which primarily makes its shoes in Asia and Germany, will eventually raise prices on its U.S. products, according to the brand, which did not disclose how much increases will be or what items will be affected. These are some of Adidas’ most classic sneakers for men and women. The Samba has a leather upper, synthetic fabric lining and grippy rubber outsole. Birkenstock, which makes products at its factories in Germany, plans to raise prices globally to offset tariffs at some point before September. The brand’s Arizona slip-on sandal for men and women has two adjustable straps and a cork footbed. There’s also a deep heel cup to keep your foot secure, as well as a raised toe bar to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, according to the brand. During a recent earnings call, Under Armour, which sources products from countries like Vietnam, Jordan and Indonesia, shared that it’s increasing prices on its apparel, shoes and accessories. We’ve tested lots of Under Armour’s activewear and sneakers over the years. The Charged Surge 4, available in men’s and women’s sizes, is a basic shoe that’s great for walkers, runners and gym goers. It has a cushioned midsole to support feet and a grippy rubber outsole to stabilize you on various surfaces. The sneaker is also made with mesh to keep feet cool. SharkNinja already raised prices on a handful of products in response to tariffs, and will continue to, according to a statement from the company’s CEO during a recent earnings call. Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja’s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it’s big enough to feed a few people, yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand. We recommend Dyson’s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy — Dyson’s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool. In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We’re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven’t seen yet — that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand’s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions. Ikea’s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they’re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz’s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. “This storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City — it’s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,” he says. “It’s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.” Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas — that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper’s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. “I bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,” she says. “It’s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I’m really picky about my mattresses because I’m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn’t trap heat, in my experience.” The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you’re in the market for one of the brand’s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand’s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand’s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you’re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent. Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited “global economic factors and rising material costs” as the reason for the hike. Rabinowitz started buying the brand’s diapers when his baby was born last year. “Using Coterie’s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don’t have ingredients that I’m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,” says Rabinowitz. “The subscription is easy to use and very flexible — if I’m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.” Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn’t specify which ones — if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo’s compact travel stroller. “The Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,” she says. “It’s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it’s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.” Yes, in addition to individual brands, some retailers plan to start pricing their merchandise higher due to tariffs. Here are a few we know about right now: The companies below already raised prices due to tariffs, and they may do so again depending on how policies change over the next few weeks. I’ll continue updating this list as more companies announce hikes. Tariffs are causing many people to reevaluate their spending habits. In fact, 49% of U.S. consumers plan to buy less frequently if/when tariffs raise prices, according to Smarty. Here are a few expert tips from Porwal to help you save. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. If a company brings foreign goods into the U.S., it must pay the U.S. government a percentage of those goods. Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries, including Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Africa, could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China is also in ongoing talks with the U.S, about tariffs — the current 90-pause on duties between the countries expires on Aug. 12. Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven’t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April — that won’t be the case forever though. “Companies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that’s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,” says Ales. “But eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they’ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.” Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. “The tariff needs to be absorbed by someone — is it the business or the consumer?,” says Steinman. “We don’t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.” “In terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it’s going to be almost universal,” says Steinman. “Right now, it seems like it’s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.” That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal. There’s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by. Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. “So far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There’s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they’re accepting the volatility around tariffs,” she says. “It’s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don’t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.” Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now. At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also ensure that all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and with no undisclosed financial conflicts of interest. I’m a reporter at NBC Select who has been covering tariffs since they were imposed earlier this year. To write this article, I interviewed four experts about what you should buy as brands raise prices due to tariffs, and rounded up a handful of related foreign-made goods the NBC Select staff recommends. I also put together a list of brands that have raised prices due to tariffs already.

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says the 'honest work' learned through trade schools could be the key out of poverty for many struggling in today's job market wanting to 'improve their lives.' The crime of post-60s liberalism is that it created permanent Black underclasses all over America, including on the South Side of Chicago where I live. The schools here are poor. Opportunities have been replaced by government handouts. Violence robs far too many families of their loved ones. Yet, there is much untapped potential in these underclasses. I thought about them as I listened to Mike Rowe of "Dirty Jobs" detail the need for hundreds of thousands of tradesmen and women recently at the Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit. He began by saying, "We’ve been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code." I, too, have been told to pursue that as a means of opportunity for my youth. But I always believed in the power of the trades. Rowe pointed out how the advent of AI has decimated many coding jobs but has not come after "the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipefitters, the HVAC, or the electricians." AI cannot do manual labor. MIKE ROWE REVEALS WHICH AMERICAN JOBS WILL REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY THE COMING AI REVOLUTION For the last 20 or so, our nation has emphasized the college degree above everything, including vocational training. In my opinion, this has been disastrous. In my community, there are still those who look down at the prospect of working with their hands. They believe the college degree is their ticket. Maybe it is, but my point here is that work done by our hands should not be looked down upon in our culture. It’s honest work. Rowe said that he heard Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, say in Aspen that "we need 500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." My non-profit has provided training in the electrician field to many individuals, including a Chicago Police officer who eventually left the force to work full time in her new field. He said the over 80,000 collision repair technicians would be needed. Over 140,000 tradespeople are needed to help companies build and deliver nuclear-powered submarines to the Navy. And for the energy field, 300,000 to 500,000 people will be needed. AI can’t do any of this work. But I know people from the South Side and similar neighborhoods across America who can. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION We need to train these people and put them to work. They may be living in poverty and they may not have received the best education. But many of them are hungry to improve their lives. That is why our nation must reverse the decline of post-60s liberalism by giving these people direct pathways to opportunity. If one should fail or act detrimentally, then dismiss that person and let him or her be an example to others of what happens when one doesn’t fully commit.

Nvidia (NVDA) ordered 300,000 chipsets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), as the chipmaker prepares to resume sales in China amid strong demand in the country, a Reuters report said. The order is for Nvidia’s H20 chips, a less-powerful AI chip tailored to meet U.S. export restrictions. Sales of the H20 in China were effectively banned earlier this year when the Trump administration instituted licensing requirements, but President Donald Trump seemed to reverse course following a recent meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon,” the chipmaker said on July 14. Nvidia’s significant TSMC order adds to the company’s existing H20 stockpile of 600,000 to 700,000 chips, the report said. Sources familiar with the matter reportedly said strong Chinese demand for the chips led Nvidia to make the additional order. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment to Investopedia. TSMC did not immediately respond. Shares of Nvidia were little changed shortly after the opening bell Tuesday but have increased in value by nearly a third in 2025.

Title: Hubert Horan: Can Airlines Get Passengers to Accept AI-Driven Personalized/Surveillance Pricing?

Yves here. The individualized price gouging that Delta plans to implement seems to be coming soon. But as Hubert Horan explains, this case of “AI is coming to eat your lunch” does not look as easy to pull off as Delta might think. Even so, Congresscritters are already saddling up to head Delta off at the pass. The proposed bill below is in addition to objections raised by three Senators that Hubert mentions below. You shouldn’t be charged more or paid less because of your ZIP code or search history. I just introduced a bill to ban “surveillance pricing” — when corporations use your data to hike up prices or cut your wages. It’s invasive. It’s exploitative. And it needs to end. pic.twitter.com/4vOn6AFPF2 — Congressman Greg Casar (@RepCasar) July 27, 2025 The Economist just reported on another ruse that some US airlines tried implementing. It falls short of the individual pricing threat, but still got travelers’ dander up: In recent years airlines have grown ever more sophisticated in their pricing techniques. American carriers’ latest method of singling out business passengers, though, is strikingly simple—and has sparked outrage in the travel blogosphere. In May Thrifty Traveler, a website about travel bargains, reported that America’s three big legacy airlines—American, Delta and United—had started charging higher per-person fares for single-passenger bookings than for identical itineraries with two people. Kyle Potter, the author, grumbled that the practice amounted to carriers “weaponis[ing] their fares” against solo travellers who “can’t clone themselves”. Brian Kelly of The Points Guy, another travel site, called it “greed getting out of control” and said that airlines were “asking for government intervention”. Although no airline has yet commented on the subject, Delta and United reportedly scrapped the practice amid the criticism. To investigate further, The Economist turned to Serpapi, an automated interface to Google Flights, a fare database. For all direct domestic journeys on America’s three big legacy carriers, we downloaded one-way main-economy fares as of July 20th for one and two passengers to travel on Monday July 28th, choosing whichever flight had an airline’s cheapest single-passenger price for that route that day. We also pulled return fares—one the following Friday and the other on Saturday—for both one and two passengers. In total, we amassed 19,000 prices across 3,200 routes. Delta has indeed abandoned the technique: its two-passenger price is always at least twice the fare for one. But American and United have persisted. Solo flyers who travel with them within the work week can end up paying more than everyone else, including solo travellers whose journey involves a weekend stay and those who travel with others, regardless of whether their trip stretches into a weekend. In other words, airlines are exposed to consumer backlash, and even, as regulated entities, political pressure. So individualized pricing were to get traction, some airlines could tout their abstention. I could see Middle Eastern carriers, like Qatar Air and Emirates, which cater to a high end clientele, advertising that they don’t nickel and dime customers this way. By Hubert Horan, who has 40 years of experience in the management and regulation of transportation companies (primarily airlines) and has been publishing analysis of Uber since 2016 Delta’s President Glen Hauenstein told investors that it sees AI-driven personalized (or surveillance) pricing as “a full re-engineering of how we price, and how we will be pricing in the future”. He said “we’re really excited about partnering with Fetchrr” (Delta’s Israel-based AI consultant) whose tools were helping Delta “get inside the mind of our consumer” so that eventually, “we will have a price that’s available on that flight, on that time, to you, the individual.” He said that AI tools were now setting prices on 3% of Delta flights but he expected 20% of flights would be AI priced by the end of 2025.[1] The definition of personalized/surveillance pricing is well understood and represents a radical departure from other forms of algorithmic pricing. [2] Algorithmic pricing simply means that many of the rules (algorithms) governing when prices should be adjusted in response to new information about consumer demand or competitor actions have been automated. Airlines pioneered pricing automation in the 1980s, which incorporated second degree price discrimination, so different fares can be offered on flights with higher or lower demand, and different fares can be offered with different conditions (advance purchase requirements, different checked baggage or seat assignment surcharges). But under second degree price discrimination every consumer sees the exact same price offering at any given time. Every consumer has the identical opportunity to pay less if they buy in advance and can only sit in the very back of the plane or pay more at the last minute and sit closer to the front. Delta is reengineering its pricing around using first degree price discrimination. Personalized/surveillance data is used to estimate the maximum price each individual would be willing to pay. Individuals would no longer see the same prices that all others are seeing. Any claims that first degree price discrimination would improve overall efficiency or benefit consumers are false. The original use of second degree price discrimination in the 80s did improve efficiency and consumer welfare. Price sensitive customers who were willing to buy tickets on lower demand in advance got much lower fares than previously available, and more time-sensitive customers willing to pay more got greater access to higher demand flights at the last minute. Airlines achieved much higher capacity utilization (load factors), earned much more revenue on flights that had previously been half empty, and avoided the huge expense of adding aircraft that were only needed at peak periods. But the efficiency gains from price discrimination were exhausted long ago. Increased price discrimination would only be a wealth transfer from consumers to airline shareholders. To use simplistic Economics 101 terminology, when everyone sees a standard market price, a consumer surplus is created because some consumers would have been willing to pay more. First degree price discrimination using personalized/surveillance pricing attempts to eliminate as much of that consumer surplus as possible by charging each customer the most they would be willing to pay. Passengers pay more without getting anything of value in return. Lots of companies have tried to introduce personalized/surveillance pricing but corporate announcements including Delta’s usually generate consumer backlash. Three Democratic Senators complained that this could support predatory pricing and demanded that Delta disclose what information about individual consumers it would be using to set prices. [3] Airline passengers understand that airlines don’t have their best interests in mind, can quickly see through attempts to claim first degree price discrimination is the same thing as traditional second-degree discrimination and readily dismiss ludicrous attempts to claim personalized/surveillance pricing will actually lead to lower prices. [4] The shift from second degree to AI-driven first-degree price discrimination would be one of the biggest aviation changes in decades. So I went to the Fetcherr website and found surprisingly that it said that its airline AI offerings don’t actually do any of the things Hauenstein was claiming. [5] They don’t collect data about individual customers or analyze the price elasticities or other characteristics of individual customers or fine-tuned customer segments. Fletchrr emphasizes that its AI/data tools are designed to be easily integrated into existing pricing practices and there is absolutely no suggestion they were designed to help an airline to completely reengineer its pricing function. Something is seriously wrong here, but what? Are Delta and/or Fletchrr being less than honest about what they are doing? Major investments in AI tools are only appropriate in cases where a company needs to process massively greater amounts of external data than before and wants to divine correlations that human analysts using PC based software could never find. Large Language Models identify text patterns that can help automate preparation of article summaries and documents. Activity specific models find correlations between millions of historical inputs and outputs that can support the automation of basic tasks like coding or accounting. Two major AI applications are especially relevant here. The primary “get inside the mind of the consumer” case is advertising, where large companies like Google and Facebook used their access to massive amounts of data about individual users to program real-time ads more effectively than traditional human marketing analysts. The primary “use Big Data to totally re-engineer previously human+PC software analytical functions” came in the 1990s when hedge funds used hitherto unprecedented amounts of computing power to find factors correlated with asset price changes that drove more higher average returns and incorporate them into high-speed computerized trading strategies. [6] One possible explanation for these apparent contradictions is that Fletchrr doesn’t understand airline pricing very well. Its founders come from the hedge fund world where AI tools are critical because there are millions of traders, billions of transactions, individual markets are highly volatile, can be influenced by an unpredictable range of external factors, and major traders are constantly changing their strategies. Fletchrr never explains why this experience would apply to airlines where supply and demand are highly stable in the short/medium term, the number of airline competitors is limited and while their pricing approaches can evolve over time they haven’t changed dramatically or unexpectedly in decades. Why did Fletchrr see airlines as a prime target for its AI sales efforts? Because they thought airlines were “outdated” “undisrupted” and had seen few recent technological advances. In fact, airlines were perhaps the non-military industry quickest to drive innovation in operations research, IT technology, and modern pricing/distribution tools, and of course saw business models totally transformed in the last quarter of the 20th Century. They may not seem highly dynamic to someone whose experience is limited to the recent development of hedge fund quant models, but very few industries anywhere experience that rate of technological change. Fletchrr says airlines need AI tools to handle today’s faster rate of change, but the only examples of hard to handle change it offered were nonsensical–the impact of Covid on demand and the challenge of previously unscheduled flights into Doha for the FIFA World Cup. Fletchrr doesn’t provide any concrete examples of major problems it can solve that current pricing systems can’t deal with. The input data for Fletchrr’s AI market model is the exact same input data airline revenue management systems have been using for decades. There might be value in a tool that can quickly process greater volumes of input data; every corporate function could be improved at the margin, and perhaps these gains would justify the IT investment. But these would be marginal improvements, would not represent the complete reengineering of pricing that Delta claimed, or anything that could produce the major revenue/profit impacts that would justify major announcements to investors. Another possible explanation is that Delta executives never thought through the requirements, potential gains and implementation risks of re-engineering its existing systems into personalized/surveillancepricing. Perhaps Delta never bothered to figure out that Fletchrr’s software was only offering marginally greater automation of traditional pricing tasks and never considered that Fletchrr’s software wasn’t designed to drive the dramatic changes it thought its investors would value. Delta hasn’t made any attempt to define the shortcomings in its existing pricing systems that it is hoping to address or explain how a future reengineered system would differ from today’s. Maybe Delta executives had drunk the Kool-aid of the AI hype machine, assumed anything labelled “AI” would have magical, powerful impacts anywhere and never stopped to consider whether the conditions that allowed AI tools to create value in other industries applied here. Perhaps Delta executives more cynically thought that splashy announcements of big AI projects would juice the stock price, would reinforce Delta’s image of having more progressive management than United or Delta, and assumed that investors would never hold management accountable if there wasn’t a big revenue/profit boost. Even if it is I possible that Fletchrr’s hedge fund trained AI experts overestimated the applicability of its tools to airlines and that Delta management accepted too much AI hype it seems rather improbable that both these two sophisticated companies would announce a major effort where the goals were badly misaligned. One more plausible explanation is that Fletchrr fully understands that Delta is determined to achieve first degree price discrimination, and both parties wanted to obscure this. It could be that Fletchrr knew its AI-driven Market Model was well suited for personalized/surveillance pricing but deliberately excluded any mention of this from its promotional material to help shield airline clients from external criticism in cases like this. Fletchrr’s website gives Delta a way to plausibly deny outside critics (“that’s not what these AI tools do!”) without having to formally disavow their pursuit of personalized/surveillance pricing. It could be that Fletchrr’s models were never designed to process huge volumes of personal information but Delta believe they can be adopted to support first degree price discrimination. It remains possible that Delta’s effort to use AI-driven personalized/surveillance pricing will fail to materially boost profitability. The articles reporting Hauenstein’s claim mentioned a range of potential obstacles to personalized/surveillance pricing including the ready availability of data on market (non-personalized) prices that would allow flyers to see if Delta was trying to get them to pay above-market fares. While it is widely understood how Google and Facebook can use terabytes of personal data to tailor ad displays, no one has publicly explained how personal data would allow an airline to calculate price elasticities for each customer and reliably predict that this individual shopping for this specific flight would be willing to pay more than it was asking other customers to pay. It is not even clear that the price elasticities of individual customers can be measured, or that a system could identify how an individual’s elasticity varied from trip to trip (e.g. critical last minute sales meeting, attending a conference that may or may not have value, taking the kids to visit grandma). Many observers assume that first degree price discrimination would require forcing most passengers to not only grant Delta access to much more personal information than they have now, but to force them use Delta-controlled sales channels. A recent American attempt to force corporate agents serving higher yielding passengers to use a captive channel actually reduced revenue by over a billion dollars and was withdrawn. [7] Delta’s best customers might similarly resist any attempt to force them to use a channel that prevented them from seeing what true market rates were. Uber provides a case example of a company where shifting to first degree price discrimination did produce a very large profit boost. Uber previously offered the same fare to any customer and offered the same payment to any driver (based on factors such as distance and time of day) with a system that estimated the highest fare/lowest payments they would accept.[8] But if Delta was attracted to personalized/surveillance pricing by the big profit boost Uber achieved it may be badly disappointed because Delta has none of the structural advantages that allow Uber to maximize exploitive discrimination. Uber rides are last minute purchases and riders have no ability to compare prices. There are no independent Google/Kayak/Expedia-type sources of true market taxi pricing information. Delta frequent flyers understand airline pricing and would quickly figure out if changes were unfavorable. Uber users have no real idea how Uber pricing works, and Uber (and Lyft) have achieved quasi-monopoly pricing power after using billions in predatory subsidies to drive independent competition out of the market. It should be emphasized that the central issue, should Delta have any success pursuing first degree price discrimination is not “AI technology” or “pricing algorithms” but the ability to exploit anti-competitive market power. Simplistic Economics 101 models say producers can’t achieve the capture of consumer surplus that Delta hopes to achieve using first degree price discrimination because consumers would be protected by market competition and the availability of perfect information about market prices. First degree price competition works for Uber because they tightly control all marketplace information, have eliminated all meaningful competition and any ability of elected officials to enforce consumer and labor law protections. Even Uber investors have no ability to see how pricing and driver compensation changes affect profitability. Thus any attempt to implement first degree price discrimination requires subverting the proper workings of competitive markets. Without significant artificial market power Delta would have no ability to force its best customers to use Delta controlled distribution channels, or to limit their ability to see if Delta is only showing them fares higher than other customers can get. Without significant artificial market power Delta would have no ability to blow off customer backlash, negative publicity and complaints from Congress. The ability to impose first degree price discrimination should perhaps be seen as prima facie evidence that a company has artificial anti-competitive market power. While normal companies that achieved a multi-billion profit recovery would aggressively publicize the brilliance of its management moves, Uber management has gone to great lengths to keep the public from becoming aware that it made a major shift to first order price discrimination and that that shift was the major reason Uber finally became profitable. Uber understands that a greater awareness of passenger/driver exploitation could not only drive serious customer/political backlash but create awareness that its profitability had nothing to do with management brilliance but was driven entirely by the subversion of market competition. Delta might rationally believe that it already has the artificial market power to pursue personalized/surveillance pricing while ignoring the objections of its best customers but Uber management might warn them to take these risks more seriously. American’s CEO has already called Delta’s proposed pricing shift a “bait and switch” plan.

I could very easily see this happening. I travel a lot on Delta, and I believe I have been targeted in this way in recent months. The increase in business class fare offerings has been amazing and I believe that once you’ve shown a willingness to pay $2k for a cross-country seat or $10k for an overseas flight, for a business trip where your dates are not flexible [and you’re being reimbursed], that’s what they’re going to show you for all travel from now on. But I don’t believe they can fill the cabin that way. Many users are sucked into the loyalty program or (like me) limited to certain airlines based on a smaller home airport, but if they’re going to price gouge, and other airlines refrain, I’m going elsewhere. Hopefully the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can save me . . . oh, wait. But if you really think about it, they are mostly targeting the PMC here, so maybe there will be some legislative pushback after all. I don’t know if it’s the result of AI, but something changed with Delta’s domestic pricing recently. I fly the same route regularly, and within the past few weeks the price of the particular ticket I usually buy increased substantially in comparison to other options. The result is (1) for the first time in quite a while I checked Expedia to see what my other options are, and (2) I will buy the cheapest ticket instead of the one I usually buy. I also noticed on my last few flights that the relative number of people boarding in the last (cheapest ticket) group has increased substantially, and the flights are not as full. Maybe that benefits Delta somehow, but I don’t really understand how. Unclear whether what you saw is related to the recently announced software program, which is still in early testing. But it could have been the result of a previous cruder non-AI algorithm Delta was using. As I mentioned it is well understood that frequent travelers fly for a wide variety of reasons over time with widely divergent price elasticities and no one has ever explained how any “personalized” system could afjust prices for each different situation My recommendation to anyone who thinks they have been a victim of first degree price discrimination is to quickly look up fares on an internet travel agency (Kayak, Expedia, etc) or signin to Delta with the ID of a spouse/friend who doesn’t have a similar usage of full-fare/premium tickets. Take screen shots. If its clear you’ve been offered a higher-than-market fare, complain to Delta with a “why are you trying to gouge me?” email After I wrote the comment I had my wife look up the same itinerary on her phone. The particular ticket I usually buy was significantly less than was offered to me, while the other fares were the same. I went back to double check and I was still being offered the higher rate. They will now have some solid information about my elasticity. The airlines are presumably not the only ones who can play this high tech arbitrage game, and they could wind up hoisted on their own petards. What is to stop some enterprising young nerdbox from developing a bot with the profile that would cause it to be offered the lowest price, and then buy up all the tickets for a given flight and sell them on the secondary market? If it can be done with tickets to concerts and sporting events, why not plane tickets too? When you buy a plane ticket you have to enter your passport or some form of ID. The ticket is not transferable. At least this is my experience. Nice thought though! Turning the tides on them and all Huh? Not in the US or when I buy international tix to Southeast Asia. I provide the passport # only at check in time. Expat2uruguay, I haven’t traveled much since 9-11, so my memory of buying tickets for travel and procedures at the airport when one is checking in is quite rusty. I did a cursory search on transferability of tickets and found that most airlines don’t allow it, and the few that do generally charge fees to do a name change. Sometimes the fee itself can be so expensive that it makes more sense to purchase a new ticket for the person who will actually be flying. Regardless, the person showing up for the flight has to produce an acceptable-to-TSA I.D. which matches the name on the ticket. That alone would preclude the idea that lyman alpha blob proposed. Hope this helps. I booked a flight to the UK for October and have to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization, which I did not have to do when I flew there last year. https://www.gov.uk/eta They want photos of my passport and of my face. Not surprised. Last time I renewed my UK passport they demanded to see my other passports. Rather than send sensitive data electronically (which I don’t think is their business anyway) I paid to travel by train to their UK hub office and simply showed them my Aussie passport making sure they couldn’t take pics of complete info. Yes. The EU is doing the same thing; they were trying to roll it out for this summer but they couldn’t get it done in time. Next year you’ll need another EVisa for the EU countries. While maybe the AI will make it worse but fare manipulation has been know about for years if not decades. What day of the week you look or buy, did you look recently, and location etc all of which means you’re presented with higher prices. I know I’ve seen this happen to me before. And definitely not for biz/first class. > It is not even clear that the price elasticities of individual customers can be measured, or that a system could identify how an individual’s elasticity varied from trip to trip (e.g. critical last minute sales meeting, attending a conference that may or may not have value, taking the kids to visit grandma). Patently false. My former mentor (Louviere) made his name originally by doing PRECISELY this for Qantas in the early 1980s using (what were at that point pretty primitive) discrete choice experiments (DCEs) and often used the very bad “conjoint analysis” techniques which he later freely disavowed calling most of his early 1980s research “crap and not worth reading”. But DCEs have been used to map demand functions for years, and these days with the rise of the web and online panels, map them under all those different types of contexts mentioned. The most successful applications are not ones you’ll find referenced….I’ve mentioned before the one that flew under even our radar (macquarie bank’s use of them which I discovered by accident). It’s such cases that should really worry people. My point that individual elasticities cannot be measured was in the context of an airline booking system that has to deal with millions and millions of booking/fare inquiries and needs to decide instantaneously what to show to each specific individual. My dubiousness reflects some familiarity with attempts in the past (perhaps including the QF example you cited) that were totally useless plus some other issues. What I’d seen in the past wasn’t based on individuals but on market segment categories, e.g. investment bankers, salespeople, government employees, people who attended a given trade fair every year) with the aggregate elasticity estimate applied to anyone placed in that category. Also useless in real world airline pricing. But if you have any studies that purport to estimate individual elasticities in a large scale operational setting that you think might be somewhat legitimate, please let me know Thanks for engaging. I’ll clarify as much as I can. As you might have guessed, a load of Louviere’s work with Qantas was not published as it was commercially sensitive. The stuff that WAS published (like the “conjoint” stuff using rating scales) was garbage (as subsequently said by the man himself). Thus if you want a good well known empirical example there is one which won the “Nobel” in Economics: Dan McFadden’s construction of the demand curve for the (not even yet built) BART in SF Bay Area, based on a synthesis of revealed preference data (what choices people ACTUALLY made in real life) PLUS stated preference data (what they’d do when given hypothetical but realistic scenarios). McFadden’s results were proven correct once BART was built. It is the ultimate example of how we can map out the demand function pretty easily, if you put in the work. Online panels make it trivially easy. My worry here was the siloisation of academia: nobody looking into other fields to see if something had been solved there. DCEs are sometimes criticised because the respondents aren’t sufficiently familiar with the options on offer. Most passengers on flights know exactly what everything entails and I designed surveys to give real time results on people’s trade-offs. The “what to show an individual” is trivial and I have zero doubt that big airlines have been using DCE data to do this for YEARS. We’ve gone WAY beyond the market segment objection you made. I can model individuals. I don’t need to use ANY inter-individual data or inferences. I describe this in my book. We were doing this over 10 years ago with no AI. PS AI is actually not the “big bad wolf” here. By its very nature it scrapes existing data (flight characteristics) already out there. In other words, it uses data from what traditional economists would recognise as the production possibility frontier and the points that actually got “activated” by intersections with the demand curve. Points that are currently not implemented (think of the iPhone just before its launch) cannot be modeled using AI data. People don’t yet know enough about the product characteristics and if you scrape existing data on characteristics of existing phones (think those stylus Windows phones up to 2009ish) then you’ll get horridly confounded estimates. The “artificial but realistic” data from a DCE is essential (and I stress again, following proper education of the respondents about what it could potentially do) in estimating demand surfaces (since we’re in multi dimensional space). The issue of price discrimination should’ve been addressed 15 years ago when my old industry learnt how to do it brilliantly and way before AI. Indeed AI should be criticised for loads of reasons but this is not a valid one. We shot ourselves in the foot years ago. I think they will because people really want to travel and have proven themselves to put up with any kind of humiliation from airlines and ”security checks”. Somewhat related, airlines make their money on their loyalty programs and credit cards. The high transaction fees make this work. Using points for tickets has become more challenging as airlines mostly use dynamic pricing for award tickets. Some now require login to display award pricing, so surveillance pricing is likely active for some. Data: US Airlines Operate As Loss Leaders For Their Loyalty Programs OMAAT Delta had a 10.5% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -2.5% margin United had an 8.9% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -1.9% margin American had a 4.8% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -8.3% margin Alaska had a 4.9% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -11.4% margin Southwest had a 1.2% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -19.9% margin The US carriers are all terrible now. They should take lessons from the big Asian or the ME3 airlines. I’m so old I remember fares printed in ink in schedules. And economy was a pleasant experience. Thank you Jimmy Carter for neoliberal crapification! Generally I agree but Ryanair was different. I don’t actually think it deserves the bad rap it gets. Not ACROSS THE BOARD anyway. I used it quite a bit 2009-2015 when I was living down under but attending Euro conferences (with trips to family tagged on). On the “non-bucket-holiday routes” I never had problems. You got what you paid for and expected. It was only the routes (often UK to certain popular holiday destinations) frequented by drunken idiots from my own home country of UK that made the flight awful. Ryanair has, IIRC remained profitable or at least not get hit anything like as bad as other carriers even in bad years like 2020. Of course I do wonder if an increasing amount of their profit comes from the abominable scratch cards etc they push on you….. It has been six years since I last flew commercial. Don’t miss it at all! The last airfare I paid was for vacation with son’s family, Granpa needed to be with Grandkids. Otherwise, too much business travel makes me rather drive 30 hours Thanks for this post. Thank Hubert! Whether prices are set by humans or AI, consumers will only purchase tickets if they consider the price to be reasonable. Regarding Uber and Lyft some anecdotal experience. I have found checking prices between them that Lyft is usually cheaper and when speaking to the drivers they get a higher percentage of the fare. In a recent situation my daughter used Uber and at the end of her ride the driver asked her what the fare was (as the driver couldn’t see it) and offered a $10 discount for a direct payment which my daughter did and the driver canceled the ride which resulted in no charge through the app. In major city airports there are taxi stands that often are significantly cheaper than using uber and readily available. I expect these work arounds will expand in time. In addition Waymo etc… is much cheaper and will also start cutting into Uber and Lyft’s profits. (No pesky driver to pay). As far as surveillance pricing for airlines and grocery stores I expect a great deal of on the ground resistance. Just as a reference point on AI… this is NOT intelligence or even ARTIFICIAL intelligence. As I and others keep pointing out this is not “intelligence” as people general think. This is just MASSIVE computing power. Companies have been doing this type of pricing, marketing and targeting for years! However, connecting a customer and his personal data (customer provided at the POS and ACQUIRED from other 3rd party sources) and computing a pricing target at the POS has only been a dream until recently. This is not “intelligence” this is massive computing power of data in a real-time fashion against a developed statistical model. Yes, the outputs may make senses for maximizing profits, but the pricing points do not come from any computer intelligence as we would recognize. That said, it doesn’t mean we’re screwed, but the elite have always been dreaming of that, how else are they to pay for their lifestyle. Maybe Delta executives had drunk the Kool-aid of the AI hype machine, assumed anything labelled “AI” would have magical, powerful impacts anywhere… Almost certainly this is the explanation. Horan, bless his heart, assumes that decisions about AI are made on the basis of hard-headed technical analyses. What we have been seeing in fact is that companies are adopting AI strictly out of a fear of missing out or being last to the party regarding the technology they don’t understand. This process is accelerated by the two or three companies that are pushing AI for all its worth. Fetchrr is clearly looking for ways to sell its snake oil to large businesses before the whole AI bubble collapses. Well, one advantage of government travel was GSA had contracted rates for just about anywhere you would need to go. Sometimes you could finesse this — flying from Oxnard CA to DC the contract was with United, but an option was a one-way car rental to LAX and American had the LAX-DCA contract. Way back when I was stationed in Crystal City in VA (how the Navy got kicked out of Main Navy on Constitution Ave and ended up in leased space in Arlington is a question for another day) I was a member of a locker room facility we used for jogging at lunch. There were some guys from US Air who were usually there (at the time they had some sort of offices at National) and they would always be discussing among themselves how airline X had changed its pricing on a certain route and how US Air should react. I guess from the days before software took it all over. Back then Piedmont had a monopoly on DC to Norfolk or Newport News flights, and it was always a question if it was better to drive it than fly. Google flights has served me well as it tracks price fluctuations anonymously. Price wars are quite evident there. I buy separate one-way tickets to fly round-trip US coast-to-coast every few months domestically. My “status” usually gets me front-economy seats on AA with some leg room and one free checked bag. Good enough even with AA’s ongoing deterioration to not bother with competition. Thankfully I no longer must fly to SA and Oz occasionally for work, and I can plan domestic trips several months in advance. it’s long been rumoured (long before “a/i” was a thing) that surfing with a mac usually results in higher prices than with a windows or linux machine. with my main browser, i used to spoof my user agent string. never proved a thing. cuz the user agent isn’t the only data used? who knows? Do Insurance next. Can of worms, I imagine. It’s always a good day when Hubert Horan has a new post. I just started reading the Vox article on this when I wandered to NC and here we are. I’ve read that some grocery stores are beginning to move this way. Unless they are immunized from civil rights laws, I can see many lawsuits for racial discrimination. It would be very easy to get a test group of people ‘of color’ with poor credit scores versus a control group of wealthy whites. Perversely, the algorithms will offer lower prices to the wealthier consumer with better credit. I’ve already wondered about Amazon’s exposure to this as I am sure they tailor their prices to the data they have on your purchasing history. Anyway, cheers to Hubert.

Title: Trump voter and Montana Knife Co. founder feels tariff pain: His $515,000 sharpener from Germany is set to cost another $77,250
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/trump-voter-tariffs-manufacturing-costs-how-much-increase/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T13:35:31Z
Full Content:
As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there’s the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn’t say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’” he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people.

Download your cheat sheet and checklist to start building content that works harder. Your Competitors Have Already Started. You’ll learn why traditional SEO tactics still matter, how query fanout shapes which documents are selected, and what makes content truly quotable. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Exclusive interview about the publisher lawsuit, exclusive data on the confidence of AI trackers, AI Overviews, AI Mode, and how to upskill. It’s halftime. The first half of 2025 brought major shakeups in SEO, AI, and organic growth – and it’s time for a reality check. Traffic is down, revenue is … complicated, and large language models (LLMs) are no longer fringe. Publishers are panicking, and SEO teams are reevaluating how they measure success. And it’s not just the tech shifting; it’s the economy around it. The DOJ’s antitrust case against Google could reshape the playing field before Q4 even begins. In today’s Memo, I’m unpacking the state of organic growth at the midpoint of 2025: Plus, premium subscribers will receive my scorecard that will help evaluate whether the team is adapting effectively to the AI landscape. Let’s take stock of where we are, and what comes next. Boost your skills with Growth Memo’s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free! AI Overviews (AIOs) looked “interesting” to marketers in 2024 and “devastating” in 2025. The traffic loss impact ranges from 15% to 45% declines, from my own observations. Bottom-line metrics across the industry range from “traffic down, revenue up” to “traffic down, revenue down.” In February, I wrote in The Impact of AI Overviews that mostly the top of the funnel (TOFU) queries were impacted: Every study I looked at confirmed that the majority of AI Overviews show up for informational-intent keywords like questions. Shortly after, in March 2025, Google nullified that theory by dialing up the number of AIOs way beyond the top of the funnel. Ever since, U.S. companies have experienced a strong (negative) impact, and I’m hearing the phrase “SEO is dead” more often from leaders. Between 13 and 19% of keywords show AI Overviews, according to Semrush and seoClarity, but I assume the actual number is much higher because searchers use much longer prompts. (Prompts that most tools don’t track.) [1, 2] I expect organic traffic to keep dropping as the year moves forward. In theAIO Usability study I published in May, only a small fraction of clicks still came through to websites. It wouldn’t surprise me if 70% of the organic traffic that sites earned in 2024 is gone by 2026, leaving just 30% of that organic traffic behind. Scary? Yes. But traffic is just a means. The same study also shows that 80% of searchers still lean on organic results to complete their search journeys. So, I still feel optimistic about the value of organic search in the long term. There are two questions top of mind for me at the moment: In my view, either: With one exception. The whole internet is trying to figure out whether the value of showing up in LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, AI Mode, AI Overviews, etc.) is worth more than the loss in traffic. But without a doubt, publishers and affiliates are the group that gets hit the hardest due to their reliance on ad impressions and link clicks. No one needs traffic as much as publishers. The consequence? Leading publishers and news sites will conduct layoffs and assume that Google traffic will go to zero at some point. At a companywide meeting earlier this year, Nicholas Thompson, chief executive of the Atlantic, said the publication should assume traffic from Google would drop toward zero and the company needed to evolve its business model. [3] Publishers in the EU have banded together and filed an antitrust complaint against Google for its launch and the impact of AI Overviews with the European Commission. [4] Publishers using Google Search do not have the option to opt out from their material being ingested for Google’s AI large language model training and/or from being crawled for summaries, without losing their ability to appear in Google’s general search results page. I caught up with Chris Dicker, who leads one of the co-signatories in the DMA complaint against Google, the Independent Publishers Alliance: Kevin: What’s your role in the lawsuit against Google? Chris: The Independent Publishers Alliance is one of the co-signatories on the complaint. I am helping lead this from the Alliance side. Kevin: What would be an outcome, i.e., an action by Google, that would be satisfactory? Chris: We are only asking for what we deem to be fair, which is for a sustainable ecosystem. Whether that is payment for use of content or for Google to start to substantially reduce the zero-click searches, which have gotten significantly worse since the launch of AIOs. Kevin: Can LLMs (ChatGPT & Co) provide some remedy against the traffic drop from Google? Chris: Not for publishers at the moment, no. They don’t have scale or the want to send traffic anywhere else. The current CTR’s we are seeing and that are being reported from publishers are tiny. OpenAI’s scrape to human visit is 179:1, compared with Perplexity’s 369:1 and Anthropic’s 8692:1 (stats from Tollbit’s State of bots Q1 2025). For perspective, Bing’s is 11:1. I know there are reports that the traffic from LLMs is “better quality,” but not on the metrics that would help publishers or content creators. It is very much the opposite: Bounce rate is higher; pages per session and per visit are also both considerably down for AI search traffic compared to organic search. Kevin: What are the consequences of Google’s AI Overviews on independent publishers so far? Can you quantify the impact? Chris: It’s significant and something that has been extrapolated even since April this year. There are sites that are seeing traffic drops of up to 70% since April. Publishers have no choice but to cut costs and, unfortunately, that also means job losses. In the last year, we have had numerous members who, unfortunately, haven’t been able to weather the storm and have ceased publishing altogether, and these are respected sites that were well established over the last 10 years, if not longer. Kevin: Do you know of publishers that are able to dampen the negative impact from AI Overviews in some ways? If so, what are they doing? Chris: Nearly every publisher I speak to is actively diversifying away from Google. It feels inevitable that we’ll see a mass blocking of Googlebot at some point, something that would have been inconceivable just 12 months ago. If your business model still relies on search traffic, whether from traditional search or AI-powered results, it’s time to rethink – and fast. More publishers are now focusing on direct audience relationships through newsletters, forums, podcasts, and similar channels. Platforms like Substack offer an interesting model, though I’m not convinced their approach fully suits publishers just yet. Beyond monetizing websites and content, many publishers are also developing in-house creative, social, or AI agencies. After all, these businesses have spent years engaging and inspiring audiences. Helping advertisers tap into that expertise feels like a natural next step. Besides the fact that the open web and critical societal instances are fading away, from a purely practical standpoint, there are also fewer publishers to amplify content for other businesses. And yet, I believe we haven’t seen the full extent to which Google Search will change from sending traffic to answering questions directly. At a recent event I attended, a Google representative mentioned that Sundar Pichai sees AI Mode as the default search experience in the next two to three years, with searchers being able to switch to classic search results if they want to – assuming users like AI Mode. And that seems to be the case: According to a (small) survey done by Oppenheimer & Co., 82% of searchers find AI Mode more helpful than Google Search, while 75% find it more helpful than ChatGPT (I wonder why). [5] Nothing shows fear more than copying a challenger’s user interface and abandoning the cash machine that worked for 20 years. AI Mode is basically ChatGPT with a Google logo. Google follows the Meta playbook, which fenced in Snapchat’s and TikTok’s growth by copying their core features. And most alarmingly for search marketers, AI Mode eats clicks for breakfast. Research by iPullrank found that “4.5% of AI Mode Sessions result in a click.”[6] A click. As in one! But Google cannot afford to lose the investor narrative. I personally believe that AI Mode won’t launch before Google has figured out the monetization model. And I predict that searchers will see way fewer ads but much better ones, and displayed at a better time. Due to the conversational interface and longer prompts, Google should not only have more context about what users really want, but they would also be able to better estimate when is the best time to show an ad during the chat conversation. As a result, I expect CPCs will skyrocket, but CPAs will become more efficient. Between AI Mode, AI Overviews, and ChatGPT stands this important question: How much can we influence answers, and how different is that job from what we’ve done in SEO over the last two decades? It’s simple. The tactics are mostly the same, but the ecosystem changes: 1. Longer prompts: The average prompt is 23 words long compared to 4.2 for classic Google Search. [7] The rich detail users provide about their intent hits a content gap that’s tuned for shorthead keywords on the other side of the marketplace. As a result, I see hyper-specialized content that’s fine-tuned for specific personas (see How to Optimize for Topics) in our present and future. 2. SEO winners are not AI winners: If SEO was enough and there was nothing else we needed to do “for AI,” then why aren’t the sites that are most visible in Search the same ones that are visible in LLMs? In Is GEO/AEO the same as SEO?, I found that the lists differ greatly in most verticals. Only highly consolidated spaces with a few winners, like CRM software, have identical winners across both modalities. 3. New intent: Generative: Semrush and Profound came to the conclusion that ~30-70% of intent on LLMs is “generative,” meaning users want to accomplish tasks right then and there. [8] What’s often missed is that while performing an action, e.g., generating an image, the intent can quickly flip to informational or transactional, e.g., learn more about the topic you want to generate the image about or buy icon license. Since experiences are conversational and more continuous, we need to update our model of intent. It doesn’t happen in isolation (think: one session), but several intents can occur during the same session (informational → generative → transactional → informational → etc.). My opinion: It’s too soon to coin a term. Will we switch from Answer Engine Optimization to Agentic Engine Optimization when we enter the Agentic AI age? AI has evolved at a rocket pace over the last 2.5 years, and I don’t expect it will slow down soon. In 2025, LLMs reached the mainstream. We’re not talking about a fringe platform anymore: ChatGPT supposedly receives 2.5 billion prompts a day. With Google seeing over 5 trillion searches per year, you could say ChatGPT has reached about 17.8% of Google’s volume. Keep in mind that a lot of prompts are not searches on ChatGPT, and then the comparison becomes weaker (until Google rolls AI Mode out broadly). [9] Important to note is that LLMs rely on different citation sources to varying degrees. [10] Profound saw in 30 million citations that ChatGPT, AIOs, and Perplexity rely on different citation sources: We know that investing time and resources into non-Google platforms is critical to building trust and visibility across all platforms. But now we know that the mix of platform investment depends on where you want to build visibility. Reddit seems to provide universal impact, which makes sense given their licensing deals with OpenAI and Google, but YouTube, Quora, and review platforms don’t show the same potential for gaining citations on all LLMs. Time also matters. AirOps found that 95% of pages cited in ChatGPT are less than 10 months old. [11] A big reason for this is the training data cutoff for LLMs. New models are still trained on large corpi of data (remember the Google Dance?). Anything newer than the time of training needs to come from the web. As a result, keeping content fresh and continuously iterating seems like a path to AI visibility to me. Even adding the current year to the URL (and meta-title) seems like a good idea. [12] A study by Apple, which I covered in the Growth Intelligence Brief, raises a question we might all have at the tip of our tongue: Are LLMs overhyped? [13] The answer: It depends … on the complexity of the task: LLMs are smart but still struggle with complex tasks. Good news for tech workers … right? And here’s another thing: With the increase of LLM use and adoption, how will we measure success for our optimization efforts? I ran a survey of Growth Memo in June, and it’s clear our industry hasn’t really nailed how we measure the LLM visibility of our brands. Out of those who responded, about 30% are using traditional SEO tools to measure LLM visibility, 26% are using Google Analytics 4 traffic signals, and a whopping 21% aren’t measuring yet and need help determining how. And the biggest surprise is this: Overwhelmingly, we don’t trust our LLM visibility measurements. Close to 80% of survey respondents don’t believe the way they are measuring LLM visibility is accurate. A big topic in the whole LLM conversation is, of course, whether AI replaces white collar workers or not. I’m including this discussion in my halftime report because I’m seeing a growing number of in-house experts who are afraid to be replaced. Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, wrote a public memo, saying the company would need fewer people because of AI (bolded text is mine): “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” [14] Amazon has cut +27,000 jobs between 2022 and 2023, but has never had more employees at the end of 2024, except for at the end of 2021 by a small margin. [15] Other tech companies pulled even: But is AI really replacing white collar workers, or is it used for good PR? Layoff tracker, layoffs.fyi, shows that the number of companies and employees laid off is not growing since the pandemic. A jobs report by CompTIA shows that while tech employment is slightly down between June 2023 and June 2025…[18] …the number of job openings with AI skills far outpaces the number of listings for all roles. In other words, “AI layoffs” seem more PR play or justification for job cuts. But upskilling with AI is critical. The landmark lawsuit against Google for being an online search monopoly concludes by Labor Day (September 1). The DoJ asks for: Google, on the other hand, agrees to end exclusive agreements, so we know Google and Apple will divorce, but opposes a Chrome divestiture and data sharing mandates. The remedy ruling could have significant implications on the AI race, and where marketers should place their money. For example, a Chrome divestiture could significantly set Google back, as OpenAI and Perplexity launch their own browsers. It would also mean a material loss in user behavior data and agentic AI capabilities. Losing the exclusive agreement with Apple could also mean that more users set other browsers than Chrome as default, if they can provide a strong benefit. However, I personally think the most realistic outcome is a forced end to exclusive agreements and would be shocked to see a Chrome divestiture. For context: The second half of 2025 will likely be defined by adaptation rather than resistance. Companies that succeed will be those that foster trust beyond Google, build direct audience relationships, and upskill teams in AI. Here’s what I expect for the second half of the year: Accelerating Traffic Decline AI Mode Launch Publisher Adaptation Measurement Evolution Market Restructuring Featured Image: Paulo Bobita/Search Engine Journal Kevin Indig is a Growth advisor who helps the world’s market leaders define and evolve their Organic Growth strategy.

Title: Could AI Kill Off Hollywood’s Talent Pipeline?

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Many top-tier directors and producers came into the business by doing the grunt work that AI may soon handle As writer Van Robichaux puts it, he only has an agent because an assistant read one of his scripts, liked it and flagged the right person. That assistant went on to become a producer on the Oscar-nominated “The Brutalist.” He got his start, like many executives in Hollywood, reviewing scripts and passing them to higher-level decision makers, according to Robichaux, who declined to name the person. But as the presence of artificial intelligence expands throughout the industry, low-level jobs like a script reader will be among the first to disappear. “Would his job even exist if they didn’t need assistants reading all the screenplays coming over the transom?” Robichaux said in an AI roundtable hosted by WrapPRO last week. “If his job doesn’t exist, does he not become a producer and does ‘The Brutalist’ not get made? “Worst of all, would I have a career?” The hypothetical question posed by Robichaux, who has written episodes of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and is writing the “Wedding Crashers” sequel, has a firm basis in reality, with AI promising to handle a lot of the lower-level grunt work for everyone. It’s happening faster than you think, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei telling Axios that he expects the technology to wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs over the next one to five years (although he wouldn’t be the first tech executive to make overly aggressive predictions). But what’s less discussed is the consequence of losing some or even all of those entry-level jobs, whose real value lies in bringing in young talent and educating them about the business from the ground up. That kind of institutional knowledge is invaluable in a field as complicated and politically fraught as entertainment, and the industry risks losing what is essentially a training ground for the next-generation of decision makers. “It does create a pipeline problem,” Robichaux said. “Every single major Hollywood producer started with a low-level industry job that is going away.” In India, thousands of people grow up aspiring to work for consumer goods giant Unilever. Once hired, the company sends that new hire to a rural community to sell soap, according to Arun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at research firm Gartner. That’s because the company wants the employee to understand how consumers buy their products and how price sensitivity actually works in the real world. It’s a practical example of the kind of institutional knowledge a person gains when doing entry-level work as they work their way up the ranks of their field, and isn’t different from the kind of skills, hacks and short-hand communication you pick up on the set of a film or show. But what happens to that experience when AI starts to replace these positions? There’s the risk that short-term gain in reduced costs may come at the expense of talent with the necessary critical thinking skills to lead down the line. “We would lose some of that lower-level tacit knowledge, which is important for higher-level decisions,” Chandrasekaran said. Talent agencies, for instance, start trainees in the mailroom, having them progress as assistants handling administrative tasks before eventually getting the chance to become an agent. Likewise, script readers and assistants get a chance to absorb nuances of the entertainment business, learning what works and what doesn’t work with audiences as they end up being the producers or writers of the next generation. Losing those positions means one of the more realistic entrances into entertainment is shut off. Getting into Hollywood is already difficult, oftentimes reliant more on who you know vs. what you can do. With fewer opportunities up for grabs, it could just get worse. “AI could accelerate the existing dynamics,” said Brian Justie, a senior research analyst at the UCLA Labor Center. Hollywood has been relatively conservative when it comes to adopting AI, so you can look to the more aggressive tech industry as a bellwether for the impact of the technology. It’s nothing short of brutal. The total tally of layoffs in the tech industry has exceeded 100,000 this year, according to a count conducted by The Bridge Chronicle. That’s been led by big cuts from Microsoft, Meta, Intel and others. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in April said up to 30% of his company’s code is now written by AI; over the next three months, his company laid off 15,000 employees. Google was willing to spend $2.4 billion to hire a CEO and a few engineers because their AI expertise was specifically focused on programming to replace coders. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees, “In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” While the entertainment industry may not follow tech’s playbook to a tee, it’s not a stretch to see the allure of cutting costs inspiring similar moves. Advancements in AI capabilities around VFX could potentially see layoffs in that area alone. Not everyone thinks the end of grunt work for a new hire spells doom for the industry. Scott Mann, founder and co-CEO of Flawless AI, a post-production visual effects company, said AI could potentially change what an entry-level position looks like. Traditionally, it’s incredibly difficult to jump into a position where you’re directing or writing a film. But AI tools will eventually make it easier to craft films from the get go, said Mann, who was also on the WrapPRO AI roundtable. You’re already seeing it with creators, with tools provided by the likes of YouTube and TikTok enabling more polished videos. “It’s scary because it’s not what we know,” he said. “But it changes what ‘entry-level’ could look like.” Hannah Elsakr, vice president of global GenAI new business ventures at Adobe, echoed the sentiment, noting that new hires may enter at a different level without the grunt work. She added that it’s happening with coders, and that the more sophisticated work required, whether it’s creative or coding, may help companies identify the “real gems” earlier, allowing them to advance faster. It’s also unclear if AI will actually replace all of these tasks. While the technology has made huge leaps over the last three years, there remain limitations, particularly on the creative side. Justie warned that AI won’t have the same impact across all jobs. It’s clear there’s a shift happening with increasing comfort in relying on AI and bots to handle tasks for us. But what happens if that institutional knowledge built up over experience and grunt work goes away? “The risk is we become so dependent on AI, when we have a catastrophic element that AI doesn’t foresee, we can’t make decisions,” Chandrasekaran said. And if Hollywood is anything, it’s unpredictable and, at times, even catastrophic.

Title: China Stake in CK Hutchison Port Sale Could Ease Beijing Pressure but US Geopolitical Risks Remain

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun HONG KONG/NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) – The proposed inclusion of Chinese shipping giant COSCO in Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison’s contentious global ports sale is a potential win for Beijing in a strategic sector, but the deal is far from final and could face resistance from Washington, sources and analysts say. Since the deal was announced on March 4 to sell 43 of CK Hutchison’s ports in 23 countries, including two along the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock, BLK.N and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping company MSC, it has sparked a firestorm of criticism from China. While the U.S. government might oppose the inclusion of state-run COSCO over perceived geopolitical risks posed by Chinese influence, bringing in the shipping giant could provide a more level playing field rather than one company being dominant, said a person with knowledge of the deal. The complex deal would require approval from around 50 jurisdictions involved, and it would take at least two years for the process to be completed, sources and analysts said. There was no immediate response from the White House, COSCO and CK Hutchison to Reuters’ requests for comment. At a time of festering global trade tensions between China and the U.S., the deal showcases the growing rivalry between both sides for maritime influence in the strategic commercial shipping sector that has been dominated by China in recent decades. U.S. President Donald Trump had earlier called for the removal of Chinese ownership in the Panama Canal – now used for more than 40% of U.S. container traffic valued at $270 billion annually. Following months of pressure from Beijing, including Chinese state media lambasting the move as a betrayal, and various Chinese government departments saying they would conduct a legal review, CK Hutchison announced on July 28 that a Chinese investor was being courted. It also said changes to the composition of the consortium and structure of the transaction would be necessary to secure regulatory approval. Two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the investor was COSCO 1199.HK – a shipping and ports conglomerate that is now one of the world’s dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. While any stake by COSCO is not yet clear, a triparty agreement with BlackRock and MSC would alleviate China’s national security concerns and have its blessing, the sources said. “The potential acquisition of Hutchison Ports is driven by the strategic need to secure key port resources amid global competition and U.S.-China tensions,” JPMorgan wrote in a research report. The report also noted that while the inclusion of COSCO would “relieve some concerns by the Chinese government, thus boosting the likelihood of a green-light scenario”, not all ports in the original agreement might be included. COSCO is requesting a bigger stake while the other parties in the consortium are keen to keep it a minority, the sources said. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters on Monday in response to a question on the deal that Beijing “will conduct lawful regulation, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and uphold justice and fairness in the market.” ‘STRIP CHINESE CONTROL’ A deal involving COSCO would be a “loud reaffirmation of China’s geopolitical influence across the global maritime trade and transport sector, and of its effective leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S.,” Isaac Kardon, Senior Fellow for China Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Reuters. “Beijing’s disapproval clearly forced Hutchison to back off and change tack — and not merely in the optics of the transaction, but in its basic structure and national ownership.” Should the deal proceed, it would be a crucial off-ramp for CK Hutchison, with the Americans wary of COSCO’s growing maritime heft that could undermine U.S. national security. There could also be further blowback amid ongoing and complex bilateral trade talks. Some analysts say the Panama ports, in particular, will be a focus for the Trump administration, and could be taken out of the transaction to meet U.S. strategic interests. “The inclusion of this behemoth Chinese central state-owned enterprise as an owner seems like it should be a non-starter for the Trump administration seeking to strip Chinese control and restore some kind of American suzerainty over the Canal Zone,” added Kardon. The CK Hutchison assets up for sale span the globe, including ports in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Barcelona in Spain, Felixstowe in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Poland and the Bahamas – enlarging Beijing’s global shipping networks and options at a time of great trade and tariff uncertainties. “At the moment they (Beijing) are in a place generally where they want to assert themselves and say, hey, don’t mess with us,” said Andrew Cainey, a senior associate fellow with the defence and security thinktank RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) in London. “If the U.S. were to come back and object to it, China could try to block the deal or demand more (from CK Hutchison).” (Reporting by James Pomfret, Clare Jim and Anne Marie Roantree in Hong Kong, Davide Barbuscia in New York, Ryan Woo in Beijing; Editing by Saad Sayeed) Sign up for gCaptain’s newsletter and never miss an update Essential maritime and offshore news, insights, and updates delivered daily straight to your inbox Dive into a sea of curated content with our weekly ‘Dispatch’ email.

Title: Trump’s tariffs could squeeze US factories and boost costs by up to 4.5%, a new analysis finds

By JOSH BOAK and PAUL WISEMAN, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there’s the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn’t say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’” he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.”

U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) sank roughly 20% in premarket trading after the Danish drugmaker cut its full-year outlook and named a new CEO. Novo Nordisk, which makes blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, now expects 2025 sales growth at constant exchange rates of 8% to 14%, down from its early May forecast of 13% to 21%. It attributed the cut to lower growth expectations for Wegovy and Ozempic in the U.S. obesity and diabetes markets, respectively, and "lower-than-expected penetration" in some international markets. Novo Nordisk named Maziar Mike Doustdar as its next CEO, effective Aug. 7, when he will replace Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen. In May, the company announced Jørgensen would be stepping down once a new chief executive was selected. Novo Nordisk said that the sales outlook for Wegovy in the U.S. "reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition," indicating that it belives some competing products are being sold illegally. The company sees 2025 operating profit growth, or EBIT, of 10% to 16%, down from its prior projection of 16% to 24%. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk entered Tuesday down about 20% this year and more than 45% over the past 12 months amid slowing sales growth and studies that showed the active ingredient in rival Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro and Zepbound caused greater weight loss than that of Ozempic and Wegovy.

Title: China may gain greater control of Panama Canal after BlackRock deal misses deadline

Fox News contributor Michael Pillsbury joins 'Fox & Friends First' to weigh in on President Donald Trump's trade negotiations with China as they continue to threaten their invasion of Taiwan. China may soon gain greater influence over the Panama Canal following the collapse of a proposed deal between U.S.-based BlackRock and Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison, which had initially sparked tensions with Beijing. The original agreement would have transferred control of dozens of international ports — including two in Panama — to a consortium involving BlackRock. The deal was reportedly welcomed by former President Donald Trump, who voiced support for reducing Chinese influence over the canal and even floated the idea of the U.S. "taking back" the strategic waterway. However, Beijing pushed back. China advocated for state-owned shipping giant Cosco to be included in the transaction, signaling its desire for a direct stake, not just an indirect one through the Hong Kong-based Hutchison, in the canal’s operations. Amid mounting pressure from China and the threat of an anti-monopoly investigation, CK Hutchison announced Monday that the exclusive negotiation window with BlackRock had expired. However, the company also signaled its openness to reconfiguring the deal. CHINA, HONG KONG THREATEN TO THWART SALE OF PANAMA CANAL PORTS TO AMERICA'S BLACKROCK It said it would "remain open to discussions with a view to inviting a major strategic investor from the [People’s Republic of China] to join as a significant member of the consortium." According to the company, changes in deal structure and participant makeup are necessary to gain approval from "all relevant authorities."

(REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) The original $23 billion deal involved transferring ownership of 43 ports across 23 countries — including the two critical Panamanian ports located at either end of the canal in Balboa and Cristobal. CK Hutchison has operated both since 1997. The firm is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s wealthiest man, Li Ka-shing. China’s growing footprint in Latin American infrastructure has long raised bipartisan alarms in Washington. However, Trump stands out as the first modern U.S. president to suggest reclaiming the Panama Canal, which the U.S. completed in 1914 and handed over to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 during the Carter administration. CHINA’S BILLION-DOLLAR FOOTPRINT NEAR FLORIDA COAST POSES US NATIONAL SECURITY RISK, EXPERT WARNS "China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China — we gave it to Panama — and we’re taking it back," Trump recently declared. One analyst believes China may ultimately be excluded from the Panama port holdings while gaining control of most other assets in the larger deal. "China will insist this be the quid pro quo: that the other global ports have Cosco participation. And obviously, Cosco is already a major global port holder," said Dane Chamorro, head of Global Risk Analysis at consulting firm Control Risks, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, File) The family of Hong Kong billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing owns CK Hutchison. (REUTERS/Bobby Yip) "From a U.S. perspective, they might say, ‘Okay, great—we got Hutchison, or China (since they tend to refer to them interchangeably), out of the two Panama ports.’ But in the long run, that may result in even more ports globally ending up in the hands of a Chinese state-owned entity." If that happens, Cosco — through this broader consolidation — would become "far and away the dominant port owner and operator globally," Chamorro said. "That aligns with the fact that China is the world’s largest trading economy, the largest manufacturing economy, and the largest shipbuilder." Chamorro also noted that U.S. companies do not operate on the same global scale in the port industry as Chinese, Hong Kong or Singaporean firms. The failed Hutchison-BlackRock deal underscores the precarious position of Hong Kong businesses under growing pressure from Beijing to prioritize national loyalty — even when it threatens ties with Western partners.

Title: Ethereum: BitMine’s Bold $60K ETH Call Fails To Offset Stock Slide

Ethereum is on the spotlight as BitMine Immersion Technologies stock took a sharp hit on Monday, falling over 25% despite a fresh round of bullish messaging from Tom Lee of FundStrat. Investors seemed unconvinced by the plan to make BitMine a major holder and staker of Ethereum. The dip came after shares slid over 10% during regular hours to $35, then dropped another 15% in after‑hours trading. According to FundStrat’s Tom Lee, BitMine plans to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply and become a “made in America validator network.” He highlighted that BitMine already has 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet—worth more than $2 billion at current prices. Lee even floated the idea that Ether could reach an implied valuation of $60,000, citing unnamed research firms. But those bold figures failed to calm the market. 10/18 We asked several research firms to give us “replacement” value (of Wall Street) to value ETH – this is for illustrative purposes only – implied value for ETH is $60,000 – ETH currently ~$3,800 pic.twitter.com/mXa5uCZukv — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 28, 2025 Analysts had pointed out that BitMine’s stock had wildly surged earlier this month. The price shot up more than 3,000% to a yearly high of $135 on July 3 after the initial announcement of the Ether‑buying strategy. That rally was met with a wave of profit‑taking once the plan was fully laid out. Many traders sold into the strength, and the mood shifted quickly when shareholders saw the fine print. Based on reports from Kronos Research, treasury rollouts on this scale require a solid plan to protect capital and maintain liquidity. Vincent Liu, Kronos’s chief investment officer, warned that without clear steps for custody and staking infrastructure, holding large amounts of Ether could create big swings in value. And those swings spooked some investors when Lee’s “Chairman’s Message” failed to pin down exact timelines or reveal audit partners. On top of that, the implied $60,000 target for Ether came from sources that remain unnamed. That lack of transparency set off alarm bells. Investors want to know who did the math and whether the data holds up under scrutiny. When price targets are presented without clear attribution, doubt grows fast. Meanwhile, other firms are also loading up on Ether. SharpLink Gaming controls 438,000 ETH. Bit Digital holds over 100,000 ETH. Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions recently boosted its stake to 29,122 ETH after raising $62 million. Finality Capital’s partner David Grider compared the trend to Strategy’s big bet on Bitcoin—saying these moves should help ETH flows and price action. Finality Capital, he disclosed, holds a position in BitMine itself. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq again hit record closing highs; Union Pacific (UNP) agrees to acquire fellow rail giant Norfolk Southern (NSC) for $85 billion; UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares are falling in premarket trading after it slashes its full-year profit outlook; Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly orders 300,000 H20 chips from contract manufacturer TSMC (TSM) amid strong demand in China; and United Parcel Service (UPS) shares are dropping after its quarterly profit comes up short of analysts' estimates. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging higher after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq again hit record highs, as investors monitor incoming earnings reports. Nasdaq futures are 0.5% higher after the tech-heavy index closed at a record high for the 10th time in 11 sessions, while S&P 500 futures are up 0.3% after its sixth-straight record close. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are little changed. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly higher at about $118,500. The 10-year Treasury note yield is slightly lower. Gold futures are higher. Oil futures are little changed. Union Pacific (UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NSC) announced that the two railroad giants were combining, creating the country's first transcontinental railroad. Union Pacific will buy Norfolk Southern for $320 per share in an $85 billion deal that will connect 50,000 miles of railroad across 43 states, linking approximately 100 North American ports. The combined company will be worth over $250 billion. The deal follows reports that the two companies were in merger discussions. Union Pacific shares are up less than 1% in premarket trading, while those of Norfolk Southern are down more than 2%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares are slipping 1.5% after the health insurance giant slashed its full-year profit outlook as its second-quarter earnings came in well below analysts' estimates. The insurer posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.06 on revenue that increased about 13% year-over-year to $111.6 billion, both below analyst projections compiled by Visible Alpha. Its estimates for full-year earnings per share were slashed by about $10 as the company saw "higher realized and anticipated care trends." UnitedHealth said it "expects to return to earnings growth in 2026." Nvidia (NVDA) placed orders with contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) for 300,000 AI-focused H20 chips as it adds to its stockpiles amid strong Chinese demand, according to a report in Reuters. Earlier this month, the Trump administration gave approval for Nvidia to resume sales of its H20 chip in China after previously issuing restrictions on the AI chip. During a trip to Beijing earlier this month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the level of orders it received would determine whether it would order more production of the chip, according to the report. Nvidia shares are higher by more than 1% in premarket trading while U.S.-listed shares of TSMC are moving slightly lower. United Parcel Service (UPS) shares are 4% lower in premarket trading after the shipping giant posted worse-than-expected quarterly profit while failing to provide a revenue or earnings outlook. UPS reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.55, lower than estimates from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Its revenue fell 3% from year-ago levels but was above projections. UPS said it is not providing a revenue or profit forecast "given the current macro-economic uncertainty.” UPS shares entered Tuesday down about 20% this year

Title: Man in 70s sent forward for trial accused of historical sex offences
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/07/29/man-in-70s-sent-forward-for-trial-accused-of-historical-sex-offences/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T11:25:34Z
Full Content:
A man in his 70s accused of historical sex abuse offences has been served with a book of evidence and sent forward for trial to the Central Criminal Court. The man, who cannot be named due to the nature of the charges, faces 79 allegations relating to the sexual abuse of four girls in Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. Judge Michele Finan at Dublin District Court granted a return for trial order at the request of State solicitor Rory Staines. He told the court that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) consented to being sent forward on indictment on the 79 charges in the book of evidence served by Garda Sergeant Amy Kelly. They include 78 counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted rape. The offences allegedly occurred at various locations in Co Dublin, including Dún Laoghaire, Killiney, and Blackrock, between 1971 and 1981. At the time, the girls were minors aged between eight and 15. Judge Finan notified the man that he must inform the prosecution within 14 days if he intends to use an alibi in his trial. She also ordered investigating gardaí to provide copies of interview videos to the defence and told the accused that his lawyer would explain it to him later. The man, who has not yet entered a plea, was remanded in continuing custody pending trial with no bail application made. Legal aid has been granted, with the defence stating that he is not working and has no assets. The judge noted that there was no Garda objection, and she agreed to a request by his solicitor, Tracy Horan, that it would include senior and junior counsel representation. The date for his next hearing before the Central Criminal Court has yet to be set but will be held the next legal term, commencing in October. Dressed in a grey tracksuit and black runners, the man sat silently in a wheelchair and spoke only to consult his solicitor, who asked that he get dental attention in custody because he still had no dentures and “is not able to eat solid foods”. He was arrested at Terminal 2, Dublin Airport on the morning of July 22nd. Gardaí charged him at the instruction of the DPP. He faces 41 counts of indecent assault and one for attempted rape of one of the complainants, 34 counts of indecent assault of another female, two counts of indecent assault of another complainant, and one charge of indecent assault of the fourth. The offences are contrary to Common Law. At his first hearing, a few hours after his arrest, the defence solicitor had informed the judge that her client required medical assistance in custody because he had no dentures or hearing aid. The judge had noted this information and agreed to add that he should urgently get dentures and a hearing aid in custody. When the proceedings resumed on Tuesday, she heard that the man still had no dentures and recommended that he get the appropriate treatment.

Get inspired with success stories from customers and businesses just like yours. Table of contents Email marketing automation is the best way to win all the benefits of personalized campaigns without incurring the expenses of running these campaigns manually at scale. Check this out. Forrester conducted a Total Economic Impact study on GetResponse Max customers. GetResponse Max provides an automation platform that allows businesses to conduct advanced audience segmentation for personalized marketing campaigns. The report showed users of the automation platform saw a return on investment of 305% and net present value of $302,000. Campaign assembly effort was also reduced by 73% while the payback period was just under 3 months. That’s the potential impact of deploying an effective email marketing automation strategy for your eCommerce business. But what does an effective automation strategy look like? This article will share the vital ecommerce email marketing automations every online store needs. We’ll also provide a roundup of the best automation platforms you can use for the job. Discover how email marketing automation can increase ROI and reduce campaign effort by 73%. Learn the essential workflows every online store needs to increase sales and customer lifetime value. Email marketing automation is the process of creating triggers and conditions that ensure your pre-set emails are sent to specific customers when the triggers are activated and the necessary conditions are met. For example, you can set a trigger for an email with a welcome discount to be sent to a user who signs up for your newsletter for the first time. This email will be deployed automatically every time a new email enters your email list. Ecommerce email marketing automation is powered by automation platforms. These automations deliver several benefits, including: The average email marketing ROI is $36 for every $1 spent. As you can imagine, this ROI can drop or go higher depending on your strategy. Email automation optimizes your ROI. This is achieved in various ways. One, automation allows you to deliver the most important messages when it matters most. This is critical because timing can be the difference between a user choosing to take advantage of their welcome discount or not. An effective strategy ensures that the welcome discount is delivered at the right time, when the potential customer is most engaged. Perfect timing is achieved with all email automation workflows, not just welcome discounts. Email marketing automation also optimizes your ROI by reducing the effort you put into campaigns. As the Forrester study above pointed out, users of the GetResponse Max automation platform saw their campaign assembly efforts drop by 73%. This means less time and salaries invested in running email campaigns. You can also expect a high ROI for your email marketing efforts because campaigns will be personalized to resonate with each recipient. Automation platforms can track the product pages users interact with and use that data to send personalized product recommendations, for example. They can also track a user’s purchase history and use the data to cross-sell and upsell relevant products. Email automation eliminates repetitive tasks like segmenting audiences, sending follow-ups, optimizing send times, inserting dynamic content, and even monitoring deliverability. These are incredibly vital marketing tasks, but they’re extremely time-consuming to do manually. Automation allows you to set the segmentation rules, and these will be executed on autopilot until the day you decide to change the rules. It also helps with monitoring when each user opens emails and uses that data to optimize send time. The best automation platforms also support the insertion of dynamic content. This essentially means that email items like the product recommendations can be changed automatically to align with the preferences or interests of each recipient. Basically, automation frees up your time, allowing you to focus on more strategic tasks like brainstorming new campaign ideas, coming up with fresh creatives, and ideating A/B tests. Effective email automation makes your customers feel seen and valued. It also eliminates friction by ensuring that critical communications like order confirmation, as well as shipping and delivery alerts, are delivered on time. Automation supports personalization, which means your customers will only receive messages they’re interested in. This makes customers feel they’re having a one-to-one interaction with your brand. Not only does it boost customer satisfaction and conversion rates, but it can also increase repeat purchases, which boosts your customer lifetime value. Speaking of which…. Ecommerce automation boosts customer lifetime value and average order value through several strategic automations. Consider an automation workflow like customer re-engagement. This workflow targets past customers who have been inactive for an extended period. It brings them back to your store where they can rediscover products they loved and explore new items. Automated upselling and cross-selling email campaigns are also critical for boosting the average order value. Some brands even include these upsells and cross-sells within automated emails, like transactional emails. Here are nine critical automated email campaigns you must create for your online store. A welcome email is deployed when a new user submits their email address to join your subscriber list. This workflow can be customized to have either a one-off email or a series of emails. Welcome emails see extremely high engagement rates. According to the 2024 email marketing benchmarks, these campaigns had an open rate of 83.63% and a click-through rate of 16.60%. For context, the average email open rate is 39.64% That’s why you must automate welcome emails to ensure they’re delivered when your customers are most engaged and expecting them. You can further enhance the effectiveness of these campaigns by adding a time-limited welcome discount. This encourages the user to become a paid customer immediately. Here is what a simple welcome automation workflow looks like. The following template uses a split logic to send different types of welcome emails. A welcome email is your opportunity to introduce your brand, explain what makes you unique, and set expectations with new subscribers. You can also share key links, such as links to your best-selling products and customer support page. Check out this welcome email example from Local Revival. The email includes a decent welcome discount, a brief explanation of what makes the brand unique, and links to best sellers. Abandoned cart recovery emails are sent to customers who add items to the cart but leave your site before completing their purchase. Cart abandonment is a big problem for eCommerce stores. Data shows that up to 70% of online carts are abandoned. An effective cart abandonment email workflow can help you recover a good portion of these sales. For example, iParts, an online store selling auto parts, used the GetResponse Max automation platform to address the cart abandonment issue. The brand deployed one cart abandonment email campaign, which saw an open rate of 30%. More importantly, 20% of the recipients made a purchase. Like a welcome email, cart abandonment email campaigns can be either a single email or a series of emails. A series of cart abandonment emails can produce better results because it allows you to follow up with prospects. Top automation platforms also let you create automation splits where you can target different cart abandoners with different messages to optimize conversions. For example, you can create a split based on the cart value. For instance, users whose cart value is above $150 can receive a cart abandonment email offering an incentive like free shipping or a discount. Here’s an example of a cart abandonment workflow template. An effective cart abandonment email includes an image of the product and a link going directly to the cart. This reduces friction and makes it easier for buyers to complete their orders. You can also include social proof like customer testimonials and product reviews to build trust and help hesitant shoppers feel confident checking out. Finally, compelling discounts can often work the magic to make hesitant customers feel that the deal is too good to pass up. Take a look at this abandoned cart email example by Casper. Casper stays on brand with the comical header that’s bound to grab attention. They’ve also included social proof through a customer testimonial. Which email automation workflow has been most effective for your ecommerce business – welcome series, cart abandonment, or customer reengagement? Customers can lose touch with your business for different reasons. Maybe they made an impulse purchase when they ran into your paid ads on social media and never thought about your brand again. It’s also possible that they got lured away by a competitor’s offer, and they’ve never visited your store again. Whatever the case may be, customer reengagement campaigns are good at reigniting the interest of inactive customers. Automation platforms offer workflow templates to target customers who have not made a purchase from your store within the last 60 days. You can also customize the template to include a custom number of days. Here’s what a winback automation template looks like. Use personalization to make your customer win-back email campaigns more compelling. You can reference the last thing the customer ordered. Tell them how your store now has the same item in different colors, for example. You can also mention related products, what’s new about your brand, and include a welcome-back discount. Here’s one of our favorite customer winback emails to inspire you. Transactional emails are sent in response to specific customer actions on your website. For example, the email can be deployed when a customer creates an account in your store. These emails are extremely important because they confirm critical actions and build trust with the customers. Transactional emails can also be considered as post-purchase emails since most of them are sent after a customer has placed their order. Here are some examples of these emails. You will need different workflows for each of these emails. Automation software integrates with your eCommerce platform to track when a customer makes a purchase to complete their order. This action triggers the order confirmation email. Once your systems show that the order has been fulfilled, the email platform deploys the order delivery confirmation email. Take a look at this example of a GDPR-compliant confirmation email workflow. Customers who have consented to receive marketing emails can get an order confirmation email with upsells and cross-sells using this workflow. Meanwhile, those who have shared their consent will only get a standard confirmation email. Check out this order confirmation email. Crate & Barrel confirms the order briefly and then takes advantage of the high engagement rates of confirmation emails to cross-sell other products. Sometimes, prospective customers arrive at your store and discover the products they were interested in are out of stock. One way to make sure that you don’t lose these prospects forever is to ask them to submit their email address, so you can notify them when the items are back in stock. Therefore, back-in-stock email notifications are sent to customers when the items they showed interest in have been restocked. These emails can help you recover some of the lost sales. Effective back-in-stock emails can have high conversion rates since you’re targeting leads that have already shown interest and buying intent. Here’s an example of a back-in-stock email. Product replenishment reminders are one of the most effective ways to increase repeat customers and boost the customer lifetime value. These emails are designed to be sent after a specific duration to remind customers that they need to restock their consumable goods. Skincare products, vitamins, supplements, shaving razors, baby diapers, and pet foods are all examples of consumable products that could be the subject of product replenishment reminders. Timing and cadence are critical for the success of these automated email campaigns. You don’t want to send the reminders too soon, and you also don’t want to wait too long. Analyze your customer purchase data to determine the average time it takes for your customers to reorder their supplies. You’ll also need to use dynamic triggers here. Some customers may buy supplies to last them a week. Others shop on a monthly basis. That means a one-size-fits-all automation workflow won’t work. You’ll need to track the purchase behavior and history of each customer to determine when each reminder should be deployed. Personalization is essential for the success of these campaigns. Reference the customer’s past orders in your email subject line and body. Use a one-click reorder CTA that automatically adds all the items. This saves the customer time, meaning they won’t need to look for and add the items to the cart from scratch. Here’s an example of a replenishment reminder. You can also offer incentives, such as loyalty bonuses, to customers who choose to reorder their items. Product replenishment reminders also present opportunities for upselling. You can upsell the customer to an auto-ship program, for example. This generates predictable cash flow for you while keeping your customers engaged. It can also boost revenue by encouraging repeat purchases. Plus, it ensures your loyal customers never run out of their favorite essentials. Create sophisticated email automation workflows that drive sales and increase customer lifetime value. Our drag-and-drop editor and pre-built templates make it easy to set up professional campaigns in minutes. Browse abandonment emails target customers who went through one or several product pages in your online store but left without making a purchase. These automated emails work just like cart abandonment emails but with a different trigger. The condition used for these workflows is “visited page,” as shown below. You must also create a filter to exclude folks who may have visited and exited that page but bought something else from another page. These automated emails would typically share images of the products that potential customers had viewed and might include incentives such as discounts and free shipping to encourage conversions. The best browse abandonment emails also highlight related products. This section can help bring customers back to your site in case they didn’t make a purchase because they didn’t like the products they were viewing. It informs the customer of other options they might find more appealing. It can be items in different styles or the same item they looked at, but in a different color or price point. The email copy does a great job creating a sense of urgency and FOMO. Celebrating your customers with heartwarming messages and exclusive discounts during their key milestones is an effective way to strengthen customer relationships and build loyalty. Birthday and anniversary emails do precisely that by tracking your customer’s key dates and sending celebratory messages. Here’s the workflow for these emails. Anniversary and birthday emails can include exclusive discounts to help your customers celebrate their special day in style. You can also use dynamic content to highlight the customer’s favorite products based on their purchase history. The email has a playful tone and includes a bold CTA going directly to the featured product in the hero section. You can automate customer feedback collection in various ways. One is to include the feedback collection link in a transactional email. You can add the link in the order delivery email, for example. Another way to collect customer feedback is by creating a dedicated email workflow for feedback requests. The best part about this workflow is that you can use a time delay to ensure the email is sent a few days after the customer has received their order. This allows them to provide objective product reviews and overall customer experience feedback based on their experience using the product and buying from your store. Customer feedback, like product reviews, gives you social proof you can use to promote your products. The feedback also helps you improve the customer experience by highlighting friction points you need to address. Therefore, you do want to create a compelling copy that encourages customers to share their feedback. J.Crew sends a separate feedback request email to collect product reviews from its customers. The email is straightforward and makes the process painless for customers by including links to where customers can leave a review for each product.

This platform can host all the rich data from the different tools and platforms your eCommerce store uses. It pulls data from your eCommerce platform and payment processing systems, for example. The data is then used to power marketing automation workflows. You can use this data to create precise customer segments and send super personalized email campaigns. However, access to the Advanced Klaviyo Data Platform is available as a separate add-on that costs $500 per month. Klaviyo also supports behavior-based automation. The platform can track and use real-time behavior and customer data to send personalized email messages instantly. Split logic is another capability available on Klaviyo automations. This feature puts customers through different paths based on specific conditions and triggers.

Klaviyo email is available for $45 per month, with a limit of 15,000 monthly emails. This plan includes the drag-and-drop automation builder, workflow templates, and product recommendations. Unfortunately, both the data platform ($500/mo) and SMS automation ($60/mo for email + SMS) are available as separate add-ons. Additionally, the automated product review request tool is sold separately, starting at $25 per month. This makes Klaviyo one of the more expensive eCommerce email marketing automation solutions. Check our guide to the top Klaviyo alternatives if you want to see how other tools compare. G2 rating: 4.6 out of 5 Omnisend automates critical steps within the customer journey across several marketing channels, including email and SMS. The platform provides prebuilt automation workflows, complete with prebuilt email subject lines and messages, to help you set up and deploy your automated campaigns in no time. These workflows are fully customizable, so you can edit them to include custom triggers and conditions and even split the workflows. This is done through a visual automation editor. Omnisend’s automation platform supports A/B testing. You can test the messages and incentives used within your workflows to see what resonates the most with your audience. Omnisend offers a decent free plan that includes several automation features, such as pre-built e-commerce workflows, conditional content blocks, automation splits, and custom workflows. However, the free plan only accommodates 500 email sends per month. That’s very little, so most stores will need to upgrade to the paid plans. The recommended Pro plan starts at $41.30 for a contact list size of 1,001 to 1,500. This plan offers unlimited monthly email sends, personalized product recommendations, and advanced reporting. G2 rating: 4.6 out of 5 Mailchimp is one of the most well-known email marketing tools. The platform provides email automation solutions, like the intuitive drag-and-drop automation builder. You also get ready-made templates for popular eCommerce workflows, such as a welcome series, cart recovery, and winback email campaigns. Mailchimp integrates with over 300 apps to help you track customer behavior and deploy automated email marketing campaigns based on real-time actions. You can build automations and create up to 4 flow steps using Mailchimp’s Essentials plan, which costs $26.50/mo for 1,500 contacts. You’ll need at least the Standard plan, which goes for $45/mo for 1,500 contacts, to unlock more automation workflow steps (up to 200). The Standard plan also supports dynamic content, send time optimization, multivariate testing, predictive segmentation, and behavioral targeting. G2 rating: 4.3 out of 5 Brevo’s automation tools help you personalize the customer journey to boost engagement and increase sales. The platform can track customer behavior, like the messages they open and click. It also provides prebuilt workflows for recovering abandoned carts, welcoming new subscribers, and celebrating customer birthdays and anniversaries. Plus, you can create your own workflows from scratch with their workflow builder. Brevo supports advanced audience segmentation. You can group your email list subscribers based on their activities in your store, the actions they take, and their purchase history. Brevo’s automation features are available across all plans, including the free package. The difference lies in the number of emails you can send. The free plan limits you to just 300 emails per day and automations for up to 2,000 contacts. The Starter plan supports unlimited automated email sends at $8.08/mo. Marketing automations are still capped at 2,000 contacts. Also, you’ll need to pay an extra $10.80 for a total of $18.88/mo to remove Brevo branding from your emails. The Business plan costs $16.17 per month and includes additional features like send time optimization, A/B testing, and unlimited marketing automation. G2 rating: 4.5 out of 5 Mailerlite integrates with various e-commerce tools, including Stripe, Make, Shopify, WordPress, and WooCommerce. These deep integrations help you track sales and customer behavior on your site to create personalized, automated email campaigns. Mailerlite automates various stages of the customer journey, starting with welcome emails to post-purchase emails like customer survey campaigns. It gives you access to both prebuilt workflow templates and a workflow editor. Mailerlite’s workflow editor allows you to add up to three triggers for a single workflow. This adds efficiency to your processes. Instead of building and maintaining three separate workflows, you can create one with three different triggers. Email automation is available on both the free and Growing Business($13.50/mo for 1,000 contacts) plans. However, these plans have limited capabilities. For example, you don’t get multiple automation triggers, and the automation templates are also limited. You’ll need the Advanced plan ($27/mo for 1,000 contacts) to access multiple automation triggers and unlimited automation templates. G2 rating: 4.6 out of 5 ActiveCampaign helps you build more responsive customer experiences through automations powered by customer data and real-time behaviors. Setting up these automations is fairly straightforward. In addition to prebuilt workflows, the platform provides a conversational AI assistant that works with you to bring your automation ideas to life. ActiveCampaign integrates with over 900 platforms. This helps with tracking customer behavior across your online store, for example. Site and event tracking is then used to send personalized product recommendation emails. The email automation tools also support conditional and split logics. That allows you to build branching paths so you can deliver tailored experiences to each customer. You can also split-test your automations to optimize your campaigns and make sure you’re not leaving any money on the table. Marketing automation is available on the $15/mo Starter plan. You’re limited to up to five actions per automation on this plan. Segmentation is also limited in that plan. The Plus package costs $49/mo and supports unlimited actions per automation.

Title: 21 states warn JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, BlackRock’s Larry Fink to scrap ‘woke’ environmental goals

Full Content:
Nearly two dozen states on Tuesday warned CEOs of the nation’s largest financial firms – including BlackRock’s Larry Fink and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon – to scrap “woke investing” programs focused on environmental goals if they want to continue doing business in their states. Letters signed by 26 state financial officers hit the desks of top bosses at BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Fidelity Investments, State Street and Vanguard. State officials ordered these firms to take five concrete actions to demonstrate their “commitment to a fiduciary model grounded in financial integrity, not political advocacy.” Among these steps is a commitment to abstain from “international political agendas” like net-zero climate mandates or the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Directive, which requires companies to regularly publish reports on the environmental and social risks they face. In the letters, leaders of red states slammed the erosion of “traditional fiduciary duty” in favor of ESG investing, or the environmental, social and governance goals of financial firms. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” officials said in a copy of the letter obtained by The Post. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers. We expect detailed evidence that your firm’s investment practices, proxy voting and corporate engagement behavior…align with traditional fiduciary standards.” Officials from 21 states – including Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Utah – demanded that CEOs respond to the letter’s demands by September 1. Some states have more than one official represented on the letters. The letters come after Texas last month removed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its blacklist. For nearly three years, BlackRock was banned from doing business with Texas state pension and investment funds, which hold an estimated $50 billion in assets, over its climate policies. BlackRock earlier this year rolled back some of its environmental goals, exiting the Climate Action 100+ investor group and withdrawing from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The company, however, is still engaging in some practices that seek to restrict fossil fuel output, according to a report from the American Energy Institute and Consumers’ Research, a conservative nonprofit. While Texas may have let up the pressure on BlackRock, these 21 states are doubling down on calls for financial firms to eradicate ESG goals. “Requiring America’s financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state’s dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” OJ Oleka, CEO of State Financial Officers Foundation, said in a statement. “For too long, firms like BlackRock have followed the ESG gospel to the legal breaking point of violating their traditional fiduciary duty and putting Americans’ retirement savings at risk.” Advertisement

Title: Trump's tariffs could squeeze US factories and boost costs by up to 4.5%, a new analysis finds

Josh Boak And Paul Wiseman Associated Press Published: July 29, 2025 at 5:52 AM Updated: July 29, 2025 at 7:41 AM Recommended Videos Josh Boak And Paul Wiseman Associated Press WASHINGTON – As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants" if the costs are untenable. Recommended Videos The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump's policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation," Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there's the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. With new tariffs in place, there are new costs for factories The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. Still lots of uncertainty, but world economy faces a new toll There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow" show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn't say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn't blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. Trump says no inflation from tariffs, but businesses see higher prices The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Keeping the economy on a knife's edge Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’'' he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.” Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

Title: Novo Nordisk lowers sales and operating profit outlook for 2025

July 29, 2025 07:02 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 July 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced sales and operating profit growth at constant exchange rates (CER) for the first six months of 2025 and updated full-year sales and operating profit outlook at CER. In the first six months of 2025, Novo Nordisk’s sales increased by 18% and operating profit increased by 29%, both at CER. Sales growth in the first six months of 2025 was positively impacted by gross-to-net sales adjustments related to prior years, including an adjustment related to the 340B provision of around DKK 3 billion in the second quarter of 2025. Operating profit growth is positively impacted by the ocedurenone impairment in the second quarter of 2024, partially countered by impacts related to the acquisition of the three Catalent manufacturing sites. Novo Nordisk has updated the full-year outlook for 2025, with sales growth now expected to be 8-14% and operating profit growth expected to be 10-16%, both at CER. Sales and operating profit growth reported in Danish kroner is now expected to be 4 and 7 percentage points lower than at CER, respectively, primarily due to depreciation of the USD/DKK exchange rate1. The lowered sales outlook for 2025 is driven by lower growth expectations for the second half of 2025. This is related to lower growth expectations for Wegovy® in the US obesity market, lower growth expectations for Ozempic® in the US GLP-1 diabetes market, as well as lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy® in select IO markets. For Wegovy® in the US, the sales outlook reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition. Despite the expiry of the FDA grace period for mass compounding on 22 May 2025, Novo Nordisk market research shows that unsafe and unlawful mass compounding has continued, and that multiple entities continue to market and sell compounded GLP-1s under the false guise of ‘personalisation’. Novo Nordisk is pursuing multiple strategies, including litigation, to protect patients from knockoff ‘semaglutide’ drugs. Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff ‘semaglutide’ drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients. As unsafe and unlawful mass compounding continues, the Wegovy® penetration within the cash channel has been lower-than-expected. Within this channel, NovoCare® Pharmacy was launched in March 2025. Wegovy® prescriptions via NovoCare® Pharmacy (including TeleHealth collaborations) amount to around 11,000 total weekly prescriptions, in addition to around 20,000 weekly prescriptions in the retail cash channel. Novo Nordisk will continue to invest in the expansion of direct-to-patient initiatives such as NovoCare® Pharmacy and further collaborations with telehealth organisations. Within the insured channel, despite the initiation of new commercial activities of Wegovy® in the first half of 2025, the sales outlook also reflects lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy®, mainly due to slower market expansion and competition. Novo Nordisk continues to engage in additional commercial initiatives and expects a regulatory decision around the Wegovy® MASH indication during the second half of 2025. Moreover, Novo Nordisk continues to expect a positive contribution from changes to the CVS national template formulary effective 1 July 2025, where Wegovy® is now the only GLP-1 medicine covered for obesity. For Ozempic®, the updated outlook is negatively impacted by competition in the US. Novo Nordisk continues to invest in commercial activities and label updates towards driving further market penetration of Ozempic®. Finally, while IO Wegovy® sales are growing at high rates and launches are progressing, the sales outlook reflects lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy® in select IO markets due to slower market expansion and competition. With around 1 billion people living with obesity globally and only a few million on treatment, the outlook reflects a continued global rollout of Wegovy® to more markets. The updated expectation for operating profit growth reflects the lower sales growth outlook, partially countered by reduced spending. A negative mid-single-digit operating profit growth impact related to the acquisition of the three former Catalent manufacturing sites remains included in the guidance. Novo Nordisk now expects financial items (net) for 2025 to amount to a gain of around DKK 3 billion. This is mainly driven by expected gains on hedged currencies, primarily the US dollar, partially offset by interest expenses related to funding of the debt-financed Catalent transaction. Finally, the free cash flow is now expected to be DKK 35-45 billion, reflecting the lower-than-planned expected sales growth, mainly driven by lower volume growth of GLP-1-based treatments in the US and related cash flow implications amplified by the US gross-to-net system. Novo Nordisk’s full disclosure of the financial results for the first six months of 2025 will be published on 6 August 2025, where more information will be available. The above expectations are based on additional assumptions, including assumptions described on pages 14 and 15 of the Financial report for the first three months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 14/2025). The forward-looking statements on page 23 in the Financial report for the first three months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 14/2025) also apply to this company announcement.

July 29, 2025 07:00 ET | Source: Abaxx Technologies Inc. Abaxx Technologies Inc. TORONTO, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abaxx Technologies Inc. (CBOE:ABXX)(OTCQX:ABXXF) (“Abaxx” or the “Company”), a financial software and market infrastructure company, majority shareholder of Abaxx Singapore Pte Ltd., the owner of Abaxx Commodity Exchange and Clearinghouse (individually, “Abaxx Exchange” and “Abaxx Clearing”), and producer of the SmarterMarkets™ Podcast, today announces the completion of a pre-feasibility study on the use of tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as financial collateral using Abaxx’s proprietary ID++ and Private Digital Title technologies. Building on its Q4 2025 gold-backed collateral pilot, the Company is now advancing discussions with institutional partners to conduct a second pilot transaction in Q4 2025. This next phase will test how tokenized MMF shares — when paired with Abaxx’s legal and identity infrastructure — can serve as legally enforceable, real-time collateral in regulated markets. The results will inform a full feasibility study and lay the foundation for the Abaxx USD Trust Network, as further detailed below. Key Features of the Second Pilot “The race to tokenize MMFs and the growth of stablecoins have rightly focused on efficiency gains, but they often sidestep the most critical challenge: the legal certainty required by regulated holders,” said Josh Crumb, Founder and CEO of Abaxx. “The ability to reduce settlement risk in atomic Delivery-Versus-Payment (“DvP”) transactions and unlock capital trapped in legacy T+1 cycles is transformative, but those benefits are an illusion without a trusted identity layer and enforceable title. The Abaxx Private Digital Title framework is architected to solve this by embedding identity and legal clarity directly into the asset — creating a truly native digital instrument with the integrity required to serve as high-quality collateral in institutional markets. This pilot is the next step in our mission to build smarter markets.” A New Framework for Digital Collateral Abaxx’s vision is to re-engineer the relationship between financial assets and risk management in global markets. To support this transformation, the Company has developed multi-layered market infrastructure designed to connect tokenized and traditional assets to collateral workflows — anchored by Abaxx’s regulated market infrastructure and proprietary ID++ Technology and suite of console applications, including Verifier+, Abaxx Messenger, Abaxx Sign, and Abaxx Drive. This integrated infrastructure addresses two persistent barriers to real-time finance: limited collateral mobility and the high cost of managing counterparty and legal risk across borders — the default condition when transacting in global commodity markets. Abaxx’s Private Digital Title system embeds legal ownership and verifiable identity directly into the asset through digitally-issued documents of title, offering an enforceable alternative to tokenization models that rely on centralized issuance, new legal constructs, or shared ledgers treated only as mirrors of off-chain records. These architectural decisions are designed to reduce legal and operational friction, shorten onboarding timelines, and support more flexible use of real-world assets as collateral, without compromising regulatory compliance or transaction confidentiality. This approach directly addresses the challenges highlighted by the Futures Industry Association (“FIA”) which notes the cleared derivatives industry is at an “inflection point” in adopting tokenization to accelerate collateral mobility. As the FIA’s recent whitepaper underscores, achieving real impact requires solutions that solve for legal finality and regulatory interoperability², goals that the Abaxx USD Trust Network is designed to meet through a privacy-preserving, real-time cryptographic legal agreement registry. “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently called the tokenization of stocks and bonds the future of markets³ — and he’s right. But that future depends on solving two core challenges: identity authenticity and legal certainty,” said Ian Forester, Head of Product at Abaxx. “Trends in digital assets tend to focus on building the next ledger, but the core challenge of tokenization isn’t ledger integrity, it’s liquidity. By perfecting legal claims within the asset itself, our Private Title framework allows for the creation of a composable ‘real time USD’ asset secured by tamper-proof, identity-based signatures that are agnostic to the underlying ledger. This approach not only preserves the rights of parties to transact in private, it builds liquidity through trust that is backed by the rule of law.” About the Pilot and Feasibility Study The planned Q4 2025 pilot for the Abaxx USD Trust Network will test the full lifecycle of a tokenized MMF share, with the objective of demonstrating atomic settlement and establishing unequivocal legal finality. The pilot will exclusively use MMFs that are compliant with SEC Rule 2a-7, target a stable $1.00 value per unit, and invest in high-quality assets like U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. Findings of the pilot will inform a full feasibility study and may deliver a comprehensive legal and operational package for regulators and asset management partners, subject to regulatory approvals and compliance requirements. ¹ “Collateral supply, demand and mobility,” Securities Finance Times, June 5, 2024.² “Accelerating the velocity of collateral: The potential for tokenisation in cleared derivatives markets,” Futures Industry Association, June 2025.³ “Tokenization of the market, from stocks to bonds to real estate is coming, says BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, if we can solve one problem,” CNBC, April 12, 2025.

Title: Inside Robinhood’s Crypto-Fueled Plan For World Domination

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Crypto financiers might seem unlikely guests at the Château de la Croix des Gardes, a 25-acre Belle Époque villa commanding the Bay of Cannes from its hillside perch. Yet on a sun-drenched June afternoon, Robinhood commandeered the storied estate, famous for its star turn in Alfred Hitchcock’s To Catch a Thief, for “To Catch a Token”—a crypto field day conceived by longtime Côte d’Azur resident Johann Kerbrat, the firm’s head of crypto. The spectacle opened with a cinematic flourish: a video of Robinhood cofounder and CEO Vlad Tenev driving a midnight-blue 1962 Jaguar E-Type convertible along the corniche, an homage to Cary Grant’s entrance in Hitchcock’s film. When the reel faded, Tenev stepped out in real time—decked out in a pinstriped white Tom Ford suit, black-and-white ascot, green attaché case in hand—to greet an invitation-only crowd of more than 300 that included Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and top brass from financial heavyweights JPMorgan, Mastercard and Stripe. The theatrics are warranted. Robinhood’s stock is trading at $111 a share, an all-time high 384% above last year’s levels, vaulting the brokerage firm’s market cap to nearly $98 billion and into the ranks of the world’s 250 most valuable companies. In 2024, it generated $1.4 billion in profit on nearly $3 billion in revenue and now holds $255 billion in assets, expanding at a 44% net deposit growth rate over the past year. In terms of active or funded accounts, Robinhood, with 26 million, is rapidly gaining share on Schwab, with 37 million, is three times larger than Morgan Stanley’s E-Trade and six times larger than Merrill Lynch. Tenev’s personal fortune has jumped sixfold in a year to $6.1 billion. The 38-year-old chief executive operates in perpetual motion. In late May, he is in Las Vegas, preaching to 35,000 bitcoiners about how crypto will further disrupt global finance through tokenization—the process of converting assets like stocks, bonds and real estate into digital tokens that can be traded 24/7 on blockchain networks. From there, he bounces to Tampa for a conference for registered investment advisors, and a few weeks later he’s in Robinhood’s posh Manhattan offices for its annual shareholder address. “It’s New York this week, then France, then the U.K.,” he rattles off before listing more than a dozen Robinhood offices across America, Europe and Asia. “I have to visit each one at least once a year, and they just keep multiplying.” Despite his boyish looks, including a hair bob and goatee reminiscent of Errol Flynn’s 1938 Robin Hood, Tenev these days sounds very much like the seasoned chief executive of a giant financial conglomerate. The upstart brokerage that blossomed from the ashes of the global financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street movement has grown up. It wants to be a one-stop financial firm for tech-native generations who prefer transacting digitally. Within the next 20 years, accor­ding to Cerulli Associates, they are expected to receive some $124 trillion in assets, mostly from their Boomer parents. The get-together at the Château marks Robinhood’s first-ever international and crypto-focused event, dense with announcements. Starting in July, Robinhood is allowing European users to trade blockchain-based “stock tokens,” nonvoting derivatives that track hundreds of U.S. stocks and ETFs, including privately owned tech juggernauts SpaceX and OpenAI. The trading will be commission-free, 24 hours a day, five days a week. For U.S. customers, crypto staking—the practice of locking digital assets to blockchain networks like Ethereum or Solana to earn income—will finally be permitted. Robinhood’s June acquisition of Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp for $200 million will unlock perpetual futures with no expiration on bitcoin and ether for continental customers. To underpin it all, Robinhood is building its own blockchain. “We as an industry find ourselves at an important preci­pice,” Tenev told the VIPs fanning away the Riviera heat. “We have a chance to prove to the world what we’ve believed all along, that crypto is much more than a speculative asset. It has the potential to become the backbone of the global financial system. We are hoping to turn that from a possibility to an inevitability.” To understand the coup Tenev is planning, it helps to revisit Robinhood’s turbulent past. In 2013, Tenev and his cofounder, Baiju Bhatt, two Stanford physics and math grads, saw a world ripe for disruption. After college, the two developed software for giant hedge funds whose high-frequency trading dominated Wall Street. It was a front row seat to these funds’ nearly insatiable appetite for trading volume, which they were willing to pay for. Retail investors who were accustomed to paying commissions of, say, $10 or $25 per trade at brokerage firms like Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Merrill Lynch could be a great source of this volume. Tenev and Bhatt built a fun and easy-to-use mobile trading app for novice tra­ders that eliminated account mini­mums and commissions because they knew hedge funds would pay them to execute their customers’ trades. They then marketed their zero-commission platform under the slogan of democratizing investing and rolled it out with the fanfare of a new blockbuster video game. Before Robinhood even launched, its Apple app store waitlist swelled to nearly 1 million people. By September 2019, the incumbents—Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade (acquired by Schwab in 2020) —eliminated their fees, cementing the upstart’s approach as the new industry standard. The triumph, however, didn’t last long. In early 2021, after trading on the app exploded thanks in part to pandemic lockdowns and millions of stimulus checks, Robin­hood became the focus of a regulatory firestorm during the GameStop meme-stock trading frenzy. Spurred by the Reddit community WallStreetBets, GameStop’s stock price soared dramatically—seemingly without regard to the dismal underlying financials. This unprecedented volatility triggered a massive collateral demand from Robinhood’s clearinghouse, forcing Tenev to halt purchases of the stock on the platform. Cue user fury, Main Street vilification and congressional grillings, including questions over the suicide of a young Robinhood options trader. But rather than retreat, the GameStop trading debacle—which exposed how outdated, opaque and slow U.S. stock trading is—crystallized an idea Tenev had been mulling. “Could we actually put stocks on blockchains?” he says. “My belief was that the value would be in taking stocks 24/7.” Robinhood first tried to modernize legacy systems by partnering with alternative trading platforms like West Palm Beach–based Blue Ocean to extend trading hours. However, these efforts hit a wall. “I didn’t realize how difficult it would be to change these core infrastructure elements because so many things depend on them. Maybe that was a little bit naive,” Tenev admits. Meanwhile, his crypto chief, Kerbrat, was exploring other ways to execute his idea. With U.S. regulators taking a cautious stance on digital assets under the Biden administration, the team took the experiment to Europe, where a rulebook was already in place. “Sometimes it’s easier to start with new infrastructure and build it from the ground up. We believe the technology can scale to any jurisdiction, and over time we’ll be able to figure out how to make it available everywhere in the world,” Tenev says, knowing his lucrative trading volume machine could grow exponentially as millions of investors worldwide start trading U.S. stocks like memecoins. While Kerbrat worked on tokenization in Europe, Robin­hood was reinventing itself elsewhere. In March 2024, Bhatt, now worth $6.7 billion, exited the company (he stepped aside as co-CEO in 2020) to pursue a new venture in space-based solar energy. Despite lingering customer litigation from GameStop, Tenev was busy introducing a wave of new products—IRAs, high-yield savings accounts, a credit card offering 3% cash back (with 3 million people on the waitlist), a private banking service for cash delivery on demand and sophisticated options tools previously reserved for institutional investors—turning Robinhood into “a mousetrap to trade anything,” in the words of Brett Knob­lauch, managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald. The whirlwind of launches matches its architect’s own cadence. In a moment of reflection, the Bulgaria-born Tenev lifts his palms in a what‑can‑you‑do shrug. “I just wake up, work, eat, work out, go to sleep. My wife doesn’t love it when I say this, but I actually prefer to integrate work into personal life as much as possible.” What Tenev says he didn’t fully anticipate during Robinhood’s explosive growth was how deeply accessible trading resonates with the entrepreneurial spirit. At a private event in Miami last year, the company’s top users included not just self-taught day traders but small-business owners and startup founders—people who approach markets with the same DIY mindset that built their companies. This fiercely independent impulse, he believes, is Robinhood’s real protective moat: “Entrepreneurs don’t trust other experts to do their stuff for them. They like to figure things out for themselves.” Robinhood is engineered for them—a control panel for those who want to manage their own money without gatekeepers. Tenev plans to dominate next-generation investors in three phases he calls “arcs.” First, win the active trader market, where the ROI is immediate, as evidenced by Robinhood’s current strong results. Medium-term, around five years, he wants to serve the entirety of his customers’ wallets, from credit cards to crypto, mortgages and IRAs. Third arc: Build the number one global financial ecosystem, presumably with Robinhood’s blockchain as its backbone. Says Tenev, prepping for the next day’s shareholder meeting, “This will be much larger than the first two arcs. The opportunities start slowly but compound over time.” Tokenization may be Robinhood’s long-term ambition, but its core crypto business is already a juggernaut. In 2024, its crypto revenue reached $626 million, up from $135 million a year earlier, accounting for more than one-third of total transaction-based revenue. In the first quarter of 2025, crypto revenue has already reached $252 million. “They’re eating Coinbase’s lunch in the U.S. right now,” says Rob Hadick, general partner at crypto VC firm Dragonfly. In May 2025, Robinhood’s crypto volume spiked 36% month-over-month while Coinbase’s dipped, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Knoblauch notes. Coinbase still owns the institutional market, he concedes (“their offering is much broader and custodial”), but Robinhood’s takeover of Bitstamp, finalized in June, handed it 5,000 institutional accounts and additional licenses in Europe and Asia. Tenev and Kerbrat insist Robinhood’s approach is fundamentally different from that of crypto exchanges like Coinbase. “In this industry people talk to you about the advantage of this [blockchain] layer versus this layer and just forget at the end of the day about the end user. We don’t want to build a technology just to talk about the technology. We want to build something that people can use on the day-to-day and actually see the advantage compared to the alternative financial system,” Kerbrat says. Micky Malka, founder of Ribbit Capital and an early backer of Robinhood, Coinbase and their European competitor Revolut, says focusing on the Coinbase-Robinhood rivalry is shortsighted. “To me, the question for the next ten years is how much market share they take from the incumbents. It’s not a fight amongst them,” he says. Knoblauch estimates Robinhood’s $255 billion in assets under custody will rival Interactive Brokers’, which has $665 billion in client assets, within seven years. Next up, Charles Schwab, which the analyst calculates Robinhood has gained share on for 14 straight months. Tenev is also serious about diversifying. The old Robinhood was criticized for being a payment for order flow (PFOF) junkie, dependent on heavy trading volume and the most aggressive Wall Street hedge funds. Transactions still account for 56% of its revenue (down from 77% in 2021), but today Robinhood has ten business lines on track to each generate over $100 million in revenue within two years, according to John Todaro, managing director at Needham & Company. Take Robinhood Gold. What began as a simple $5 per month or $50 per year premium service, offering margin access, professional research and a little extra yield on balan­ces, has evolved into the centerpiece of Tenev’s powerful subscription model. Among its current perks: 4% yields on brokerage cash, interest-free margin loans up to $1,000 and a 3% match on IRA contributions. The newly released Robinhood Gold credit card, which offers 3% cash back on all purchases, was just sent to the first 200,000 customers. “If they get to 15 million users on Gold, you’re looking at close to a billion dollars of subscription revenue. It’s taking a business that used to be very cyclical to having recurring revenue, then diversifying the overall revenue base,” Knoblauch says. Then there’s Robinhood Strategies, Tenev’s new hybrid robo-human advisory product gunning for old-school stalwarts like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch in the $60 trillion U.S. wealth management business. For a 0.25% annual management fee, capped at a flat $250 for Robinhood Gold members, customers get tailored portfolios of stocks and ETFs, algorithmically managed and rebalanced with human oversight. Since launching in March, this disruptive new platform has already brought in $350 million. Tenev describes his company’s approach to new products as scientific, empowering small teams inside Robinhood to test hypotheses with customers who provide immediate feedback to its initiatives on social networks. “A lot of companies will just look at what’s happening in the outside world and copy it, sort of a competitive benchmarking. When we launch products or new features, we do it because we like to figure stuff out,” Tenev says. Robinhood’s recent launch of home mortgages—currently at 6.1% for 30-year fixed plus $500 toward closing costs—is the result of a stealth online pilot it ran starting in June. “It went all over social media. Then I acknowledged we were running the pilot in a tweet. It was probably one of my most viral tweets of the year.” Tenev’s tokenization push is a bit of a moonshot, and Europe, which has already adopted many of the crypto road rules still being deba­ted in Congress, is Robinhood’s lab. “The experiment that we’re running in Europe is, What would Robinhood look like if it was rebuilt from the ground up entirely on crypto rails? Then we’ll see what the pros and cons are and bring the best of that EU app to the U.S. and the rest of the world,” he says. So far the tokenization of stocks is minuscule. xStocks, a new but already leading platform from Switzerland’s Backed Finance, has tokenized more than 60 listed equities, inclu­ding household names such as Apple and Amazon, and made them available on large crypto exchanges like Kraken and Bybit. xStocks has less than $10 million in daily volume. Structural issues abound: These tokens are derivatives backed by assets held off-chain, which means routine corporate actions like dividends, stock splits or other things that might occur over a weekend, when markets are closed, could scramble collateral calculations and risk unintended liquidations. “Some market maker has to take that risk, and how will they hedge that risk when there is no market open? If they’re going to take that risk, they need to blow their spreads and charge people a lot of money,” says Dragonfly’s Hadick. “The infrastructure is not there at the moment on the off-chain side, and the on-chain product is not there yet. . . . I’m worried these initial products are going to be essentially duds.” This hasn’t stopped others from jumping in. In June, the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini launched tokenized trading with MicroStrategy shares for its EU customers. Coinbase is reportedly seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized stocks, and even Larry Fink, CEO of $12.5 trillion (assets under management) BlackRock, is urging the SEC to approve tokenization of stocks and bonds. Robinhood is going further. Besides public stocks, it’s tokenizing private companies and has already announced tokenized shares of Open­AI and SpaceX, each valued at more than $300 billion today. Open­AI has already publicly disavowed Robinhood’s product, emphasizing the tokens are not authorized or recognized by the company. “Nobody, no founder, wants their equity floating around on-chain with holders they don’t know,” Hadick warns. Tenev is a weathered veteran when it comes to facing naysayers. “It’s still a little crufty,” he admits, using pejorative coder slang for unnecessarily complex software. “I don’t think the brokers want to make it easy for us to pull their stocks out. But what happens when it becomes self-custody? When you can tokenize and self-custody, you can be independent of the brokerage infrastructure—the same way you can load a crypto wallet on MetaMask, Robinhood or Coinbase, you’ll be able to seamlessly use any interface to hold your stocks and trade them in pretty much all instances.” This is precisely why Tenev is obsessed with making Robinhood his young customers’ sole tool for all things related to money. When it comes to retail financial services, inertia is second in power only to compound interest. Customers are inherently sticky, but Tenev knows that the old giants of the financial world, including Fidelity, Schwab and Merrill Lynch, are vulnerable as trillions in Boomer assets are bequeathed to their digital-native offspring. In fact, he thinks his biggest competition will come not from firms like Coinbase or Fidelity but from the Anthropics and OpenAIs of the world: “They’re the ones moving the fastest and doing the most interesting stuff. Though I would say it’s too early to proclaim the financial industry being disrupted by ChatGPT.” Early Robinhood investor Malka, whom Tenev calls his mentor and whose firm has already profited on its stake by more than $5 billion by Forbes’ estimates, is an unabashed Tenev fanboy. “Robinhood has a leader who’s not even 40, who is extremely AI-native, understands where AI goes, understands tokenization, and he’s leveraging those two strategies like very few can,” he says. “We’re just starting to get the right setup to bring the ‘internet moment’ of money, where anybody in the world can save in the same product. Loans are going to get cheaper because credit underwriting is going to get better. All those things.” Tenev believes Robinhood will ultimately employ AI agents to replicate and improve on the services of high-net-worth family offices, putting a “family office in your pocket.” AI is so central to Tenev’s vision that the former math Ph.D. candidate couldn’t resist recently cofounding and becoming chairman of AI startup Harmonic, which he leads with computer scientist Tudor Achim, who previously led autonomous driving startup Helm.ai. In July, Harmonic raised $100 million in Series B funding from Kleiner Perkins, Para­digm and Sequoia, valuing it at $875 million. The “mathematical superintelligence” lab is building an advanced reasoning engine, one that “guarantees accuracy and eliminates hallucinations.” No doubt a useful feature in the coming age of AI and money. “It would be pretty amazing to solve the Riemann hypothesis, or one of the other big Millennium problems, on a mobile app,” muses Tenev, referring to the most profound unanswered mathematical questions. “Rather than obser­ving that, I hope to be actively participating.” Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink and Ken Griffin, take note.

The Heritage Foundation's Michael Pillsbury unpacks trade talks with China amid market volatility on 'America's Newsroom.' As data centers multiply across the United States, energy demand is increasing at a rapid pace. This has not escaped the notice of large investment firms from Wall Street. The likes of BlackRock and Blackstone are trying their very best to acquire utility companies in hopes of capitalizing on lucrative grid upgrades. On the other side of things, consumer advocates and regulators are raising alarms, worried that these moves prioritize profits over public service. For your information, BlackRock and Blackstone are two of the biggest investment management firms in the world. They have trillions of dollars' worth of global assets and have become the go-to option for companies that need money. They have enormous influence across various industries and make money by investing in many different types of businesses.

(Wikipedia) In a bold move last year, BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners, along with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, proposed acquiring Minnesota Power, a utility serving 150,000 customers. The acquisition, which could support tech companies with energy access for new data centers, received initial support from state agencies after negotiation. Even the Minnesota Department of Commerce dropped its opposition after reaching an agreement. However, Administrative Law Judge Megan J. McKenzie delivered a surprising recommendation on July 15th, urging regulators to deny the deal. She cited troubling signs that profit was the driving force behind the acquisition. "The nonpublic evidence reveals the partners’ intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control," Judge McKenzie wrote. "The partners themselves have carefully committed to do very little." It's important to note that the judge's recommendation is not final; state regulators will make the ultimate decision on whether the acquisition goes through. Power lines. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) Opposition is mounting from climate advocates and watchdogs. Nichole Heil from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project voiced concerns over financial burdens and rate hikes: "No one in northern Minnesota wants higher utility bills solely to line the pockets of Wall Street-based private equity firms." Electricity bills are already climbing nationwide. According to the Energy Information Administration, the average monthly household bill rose nearly 4% in April to $175 a month. This is the average for a single household using 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity. To address these concerns, the Minnesota Department of Commerce brokered a deal that includes key protections. These measures prohibit passing acquisition costs onto customers and preserve programs for low-income households. "These commitments include a substantial array of additional public interest benefits, risk-mitigation tools and customer protections beyond those originally proposed," the agency noted. A lightbulb with arms and legs plugging itself into a wall outlet. (Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson) If Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Blackstone acquire your local utility, rates could increase as they strive to maximize returns for their shareholders. Sure, they might improve the infrastructure and service, but history shows that when these types of companies come in, customers often end up paying more. They need to be kept in check to balance infrastructure investment while making energy affordable for regular Americans. The rapid increase in demand for tech has made utility ownership a battleground between profit-driven investors and consumer advocates. While firms like BlackRock and Blackstone argue that their resources can modernize aging grids, critics warn of a future where reliability and affordability take a backseat. With regulators now at a crossroads, the outcome in Minnesota may set the tone for utility ownership nationwide. Do you think companies like BlackRock and Blackstone owning utilities is a good thing?

Title: Rooftop Solar Is a Miracle. Why Are We Killing It With Red Tape?

Illustration by Guillem Casasús; Getty (3) Bill McKibbenSeptember+October 2025 Issue Earlier this summer, Tara McDermott, who’s in charge of policy communications for a New York state solar developer called EmPower Solar, was telling me a woeful tale a lot like others I’d been hearing lately. A customer whom I’ll call Pam had tried to put solar panels on top of her home in Mount Vernon to save money and help the planet. EmPower submitted its first permit application to the city in September 2023 and then went back and forth with them for months as the city asked for revisions, updated proof of insurance, and other documentation from Pam. Eventually, one of McDermott’s colleagues got fed up and reached out to the mayor for assistance—in fact, he drove to City Hall and asked to see her. Upon being told that she wasn’t in her office, he said he’d sit there and wait for her return. “It turns out the mayor was indeed there in her office and couldn’t leave without passing him,” McDermott recalled, warming to her tale. “So they called the police on my guy to remove him from the space—they deemed him a threat.” Eventually, after some negotiation, two cops were detailed to accompany the EmPower employee upstairs to the building department, and they all sat there for two hours while staff worked on the permit for the solar panels. But not, unfortunately, the permit for the electric wiring that goes with it. Before that step could happen, Pam’s loan agreement expired. “There are no options left and she probably can’t go solar. And we’ve spent hundreds of hours on this one house,” McDermott told me. This tale was absurd enough on its own. But then she said something else, almost in passing: “Our CEO went to southern Spain two years ago during all this, just staying with some friends at their house there. And they wanted solar, and he was the solar guy, so they asked him. They all went to the local store, something like Best Buy, and they picked the system he recommended and signed up, and by the time he left Spain two weeks later, it was already installed and running. This wasn’t DIY or under the radar. They did it legally. Imagine that world.” In many countries, people don’t have to imagine it. A million and a half Germans have installed “balcony solar”—they simply went to the big-box store, bought a giant panel for a few hundred euros, hung it from their apartment railing, and produced up to a quarter of their household’s power needs. Other European countries have followed suit. Ditto Australia, where Saul Griffith, author of the new book Plug In!, notes that permits can be had in a single day using a smartphone app—“the tradie [contractor] often does this for you. In Australia, it takes two or three days once you’ve made the decision to do it to get the system up and running.” But not in America, where President Donald Trump and his Republican allies are pulling out all the stops to destroy renewable power. They’ve shut down big offshore wind projects, they’re limiting projects on public lands, and the “Big Beautiful Bill” not only rolled back tax credits for large-scale renewable projects, it took direct aim at precisely the kind of rooftop solar work that thousands of small contractors like EmPower produce. Upon news that the bill would phase out tax credits for residential solar by the end of 2025, the already depressed stock price of Sunrun, the country’s biggest residential solar provider, fell 40 percent; PV Magazine, the industry trade journal, headlined its story “U.S. Residential Solar on the Brink of Collapse.” That’s a very real possibility—we’ve seen the same thing once before, when the Reagan administration withdrew federal support for solar installers and, almost overnight, the solar workforce plummeted. The cuts the GOP-controlled Congress pushed through in July could take out as many as 400,000 jobs, per recent estimates. Notably, these latest efforts come after the two hottest years in human history and at a moment when, worldwide, solar power is growing faster than any energy source in history—putting both the planet and the country’s technological leadership at risk. So giving in to Trump’s attack is not an option. Instead, we need to figure out how to keep rooftop solar growing even without the federal tax credits that have spurred it in the recent past. Doing that will require, among other things, unclogging the peculiarly American system of local permitting that has played a huge role in making “going solar” far more expensive than it needs to be. If Pam’s system had gone up in an afternoon with far less paperwork, we’d be in a very different place—a place where the “abundance” debate meets the climate crisis and offers a real way out. “It’s so cheap to build a solar panel now. It’s cheaper than producing a plank of wood…But we’ve swaddled this engineering miracle in rolls and rolls of red tape to make it too expensive for American families.” Let’s go back to Australia for a moment. Down under, Griffith says, “rooftop solar installs at about 55 cents a watt, meaning electricity that ends up costing 2 or 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. In the US, it averages about $2.50 a watt, and in San Francisco, I paid $5.80 per watt.” That means it takes much longer to recoup the cost of a project and far fewer people are willing to take it on. About a third of Australian homes now have rooftop solar—seven times more than in America. The glacial speed of our local permitting plays a huge role. Contractors have to keep “rolling trucks” to revisit your roof and redraw plans. By some estimates, a one-week delay can result in a 10 percent client cancellation rate, which means solar developers have to spend ever more money on customer acquisition. (You’ve seen the ads.) Meanwhile, interest accrues on any loans taken out to finance such projects—it all adds up. The slow permitting is not the only problem—once the panels are on the roof, utilities often drag their feet in connecting them to the grid, part of the fossil fuel industry’s ongoing war against renewables. Some areas have made meaningful progress with this “interconnection” problem, and the work to push utilities to move faster continues, often at the level of state public utility commissions and the seven “independent system operators,” or ISOs, that run the nation’s grid. But these big power players can’t do much about, say, the Mount Vernon building inspector. America’s commitment to local control enables a tangle of entities to set the pace of solar growth. Happily, because many of those jurisdictions are firmly in blue hands, there’s still plenty to be done, even with Washington doing its damnedest to sabotage clean energy. Democratic leaders seem to be warming to the abundance agenda—at least they’re finally talking about whether America can be reconfigured to once more build ambitious projects. But even if we could wave a magic wand and get projects like high-speed rail or clean-power transmission corridors moving, such monumental efforts will take a while and, as with former President Joe Biden’s spending on clean energy, voters might never notice the improvement—or know who deserves the credit. But up on your own roof? You notice that. If you could easily get a permit to install a low-cost machine that could save you money, and, oh yes, also help ward off the civilizational challenge that is climate change, you might start thinking a little differently about government. Forget YIMBYs for a moment—we’re talking YOMRs. You’ve got a right to the sunshine that falls on your home, whether you’re a renter with a balcony or a homeowner. Free the electron! We’re used to thinking of roofs as protection from rain—but the sun can also provide a shower of dollars and cents, and some bureaucrat shouldn’t force you to stay at the mercy of Big Utility. Why should the Chinese and the Australians and the Germans get access to the sun while you’re denied it? I mean, what the hell—we’re bathed in free energy every daylight hour and we need a bunch of permits to use it? What’s American about that? “It’s so cheap to build a solar panel now,” says Nick Josefowitz, who runs the advocacy group Permit Power. “It’s cheaper than producing a plank of wood. It’s one of the great engineering miracles of our lifetimes. But we’ve swaddled this engineering miracle in rolls and rolls of red tape to make it too expensive for American families.” Although they’re reluctant to say it publicly, some industry people I spoke with said that it was possible to imagine a robust solar industry without any government subsidies (see Australia)—so long as bureaucracy got out of the way. Want to prove government can still work? Looking for ways to balance American individualism with concern for the collective good we call “the environment”? Ready to shake off the fossil fuel oligarchy that helped lead this country into its political morass? To the ladders! Rooftop solar is not the only source of clean energy, of course. Utility-scale solar—big solar farms—accounts for twice as much generation in this country and a lot of the startling takeoff in clean energy around the world. But adding big projects to the grid can be complicated—you need new transmission lines and substations, which the Biden administration was working to provide and the Trump administration is now busy blocking. Fossil fuel industry players and some utilities have also deployed astroturf groups to block such projects; according to Heatmap News, this partly explains why, in at least 20 percent of US counties, it’s now essentially impossible to deploy large-scale clean energy. So rooftop solar is a nice complement to the grid, both physically and politically. There’s enough wasted space up above our heads to supply a significant portion of the nation’s energy needs—one study found that we could generate 45 percent of our electricity this way; at the moment, we only harvest about 2 percent. Often, that rooftop array supplies power to the grid and, increasingly, it also fills batteries in the basement, which can not only power the house at night or charge an EV, but also make that house far more adaptable in times of crisis. Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun, said that during the Los Angeles fires, when the power company cut the juice for hundreds of thousands of people out of fear its wires would spark more blazes, “our homes became the safe haven, the place where people could recharge their phones to get the news alerts. This is critical infrastructure.” And the line between rooftop and utility-scale solar has begun to blur; new software allows the aggregation of thousands of home batteries into “virtual power plants” that can be dispatched by a utility to lessen the load on the grid. In California, Sunrun has knit together a network of 75,000 home batteries—together, they could supply enough power to run, say, all of Ventura County (pop. 830,000). In Vermont, where I live, the biggest single power plant on our grid is the network of interconnected batteries that can be called up in a pinch by Green Mountain Power. The nation’s biggest virtual power plant is now being built in Texas by stringing together hundreds of thousands of customers who use Google Nest thermostats. These networks are not just resilient—a single power plant can fail on a hot day, but not 10,000 basement batteries—they also save big money. By reducing the need for utilities to build new power plants to account for “peak loads,” the Department of Energy estimated in 2023 that battery networks could save customers at least $10 billion a year. So, dramatically expanding the amount of solar on the roof would be an unmitigated good. As Solar United Neighbors—a nonprofit that has helped more than 11,000 families go solar, concentrating on low-income neighborhoods—puts it, “demanding utility accountability and deploying distributed solar in under-resourced communities and communities of color can catalyze a shift toward a new, equitable, distributed clean energy system.” But all of that depends, first and foremost, on making rooftop solar cheap so that more and more families and landlords can afford it. And that, in turn, depends in part on dramatically reducing the thicket of regulations that get in the way of easy deployment. There’s enough wasted space up above our heads to supply up to 45 percent of the nation’s electricity needs; at the moment, we only harvest about 2 percent. It’s hard for people to imagine, I think, that permitting costs could make such a difference—surely it’s a marginal part of the cost, compared to, you know, the panels. But the truth is that low-cost manufacturing pioneered by the Chinese has driven hardware costs to bizarre lows. Even before Trump upped the tariffs on foreign panels, Americans were paying three times as much as Australians for rooftop solar, and that’s explained almost entirely by the “soft costs” of permitting, marketing, and installation. Andrew Birch, who had previously lived in Australia, remembers the hopeful days of his startup two decades ago. “We started Sungevity in the US because we thought it would be this free open market where we could sell online easily,” he says. “It turned out to be just the opposite.” When visitors would stop by to see his new operation, it seemed almost magical. “We’d take them to see the sales floor, which was full of people at computers, talking to customers. Even then, you could see a house on Google Earth and calculate quickly how much power solar could provide—our agents could design a system in a few keystrokes. Our visitors were impressed. But then I’d have to say, ‘Let’s go to the other building’—where we had another whole team, doubling the size of the company, doing customer management and permit creation work. It takes an average of three months to set up a system, and five to six months in the Northeast. And all of that head count and work adds $1.50 a watt.” The soft costs are literally more expensive than the hardware—it’s like spending a thousand bucks for an iPhone and then another thousand for the apps. “You have to arrange a site visit and drive a truck out there,” Birch says. “You have to climb up on the roof to get the rafter spacing, do incredibly elaborate electrical drawings. Then you roll another truck to the permit office. They might have different views about how to interpret the drawings, which means change orders, which means another resell to the customer.” All of this would be bad enough if there were a single regulator to respond to, as in most countries. But in America there are something like 20,000 separate jurisdictions—cities, towns, counties—that approve building plans. Each is different. A solar contractor in a metro area might have to deal with a dozen or more permitting offices. Sungevity died during the first Trump administration, but Birch hasn’t given up the fight. He now runs OpenSolar, “the world’s first free, end-to-end platform designed to help solar professionals grow their businesses and streamline their operations.” But those installers still run into permit blockage, which is why Birch spends much of his time proselytizing for another piece of software: It’s called SolarAPP+, and it was originally developed by the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory precisely to make permitting easier. In the several hundred jurisdictions that have adopted the tool, installers go through a checklist—what model of solar panel, what kind of inverters, how they plan to tie into the house’s electrical system—and the app spits out a permit so they can get to work; when they’re finished, an inspector can come out or, in some cases, simply review photos the installers send. Other countries have dispensed with permits altogether (in Australia, spot inspections keep installers on their toes), but in the US, SolarAPP+ is probably as streamlined as we’re likely to get. And where it’s in place, it seems to work. Louis Woofenden, a Tucson-based solar installer, says he can now get permits in a day as opposed to about five weeks in the past. As a result, he can far more easily quote prices to potential customers: “And there’s something to being able to say, ‘I have an installation slot in six weeks,’ not three months.” Matthew McAllister, who runs the SolarAPP Foundation, says about 5 percent of the nation’s residential rooftop projects now get one of its automated permits—it topped 1,000 permits a week for the first time this past spring. “Our goal by the end of the decade is to be able to process half of applications, which would be enough to really influence soft costs and prices.” His organization has mapped out the 1,000 jurisdictions it thinks are likely to install the most solar, and is reaching out to building departments one by one—in the last year, New Orleans and Palm Beach County in Florida have come on board. “One thing we’re always working on is to communicate that we’re a very lightweight software tool,” he says. “A level above a Chrome extension, not an IT replacement. It integrates with their existing software.” Legislatures in California, Maryland, and most recently New Jersey have instructed their local communities to switch to SolarAPP+, and other states are considering it, but it’s always a battle. The Colorado legislature gutted a proposal this past spring to switch its communities to the technology, even though it had the potential to dramatically increase installations and save Coloradans $1 billion on their energy bills by 2030. “Local officials may think, ‘I’ll lose my job,’” Birch says. “We tell them: You’ll do five times as many solar permits. If you’re just inspecting 1 in 5, you’ll do as much work, and the city will get five times the fees.” But that doesn’t mean it’s an easy sell to jurisdictions used to Doing Things a Certain Way. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which developed SolarAPP+, has two campuses in Colorado; Boulder County is a hotspot for climate scientists and has seen terrifying wildfires in recent years. (If you want to scare yourself silly, check out footage of families fleeing a Chuck E. Cheese near a horrendous 2021 blaze.) And yet in March, the county opposed a state bill to require the use of SolarAPP+. Ron Flax, Boulder County’s chief building official, says he’s a “huge fan” of the app, but “making it mandatory is always a little bit controversial. Any bill that tells a jurisdiction you must do X, Y, or Z—well, they value their freedom of choice.” His inspectors, he says, “still find things.” Some years ago, they had installers who weren’t grounding panels correctly—“We don’t have a well-established apprenticeship program for trades in the US; the actual craftsmen, these are not well-paid folks”—but today, he admits, zoning regulations are a bigger headache. In any case, one senses that Flax would be just fine if Boulder residents didn’t want so many solar panels. Building mostly utility-scale solar would be “optimal,” he told me. “If my baseline electric grid is made up of mostly renewables, then I really don’t want a lot of rooftop solar,” he explained. “It’s more efficient to do that at a grid scale.” That kind of attitude—which effectively tables the idea of distributed power generation networks—seems particularly common in progressive communities. Like Boulder, San Francisco is jam-packed with people who care about the climate, but their former mayor and current governor, Gavin Newsom, has emerged as perhaps the country’s most significant obstacle to rooftop solar, deferring to utilities and unions by reducing the price that homeowners can get for the power they sell to the grid; he even vetoed a bill last year that would have made it easier for schools and hospitals to install solar. (“We’re expending so much time, emotional and intellectual energy in Sacramento just not having the space harmed more,” says Sunrun’s Powell.) The Bay Area may be the single hardest place on Earth to permit rooftop projects. Jeanine Cotter, who runs a local solar business, gives an example: “In San Francisco, where land is expensive, we build right to the lot lines, and so one way to get light in a house is with skylights. Our code says you need 3 feet of clearance around every skylight. But if you have a small roof and skylights, well, the ability to play Tetris with solar panels—it just gets harder.” Grace Kennedy-Panda and her sister co-own a Bay Area solar business started by their father in the 1980s. She says the regulations—and fees—change constantly: “Permitting a solar-battery system even recently was $200, and now it can cost three or four thousand dollars. There’s not a whole lot of clarity we can give our customers.” Even installing appliances that in some jurisdictions have become pretty standard can be a bureaucratic rat nest in the Bay Area. Consider electric heat pumps, which replace gas or oil furnaces and are an easy way to cut both energy use and emissions. Getting them permitted is onerous in many Bay Area cities, building decarbonization policy expert Sam Fishman says. Gas furnaces and water heaters are greenlit quickly because building departments are used to them, but put a heat pump water heater in a garage, and you might be subject to requirements that really only make sense for gas appliances, such as raising it on a stand or installing bollards to make sure a car can’t run into it. “There’s an assumption that things need to be done in a perfect, buttoned-up way,” he says. “Checking too many things and going through so much process only adds the most tiny margin of safety and health improvement and is actually costing thousands of dollars.” One possibility is that America will simply sit out the global solar boom in the same way Cubans, thanks to endless embargoes, still drive ’57 Chevys. The extra costs are high enough that many locals install heat pump appliances without pulling permits—but the rebate programs for low-income residents, who benefit the most from these money-saving appliances, all require copies. The problem has reached the point where the California legislature is weighing a “heat pump access act” to standardize and streamline permitting. All this red tape might be necessary if it were in response to some epidemic of fires caused by badly installed solar panels. But that epidemic doesn’t exist—not in Australia, not in Germany, not in California. I’ve spent some of my life as a volunteer firefighter, and I can tell you what causes blazes: not heat pumps or solar panels but space heaters, which are what many poor people use to heat their homes. Think about California, where big gas explosions have caused carnage, and whose massive wildfires are clearly linked to global warming—against which solar panels are the best weapon. Even worse, the sparks that set off these blazes often come from drooping utility transmission lines brushing up against dry foliage—whereas more rooftop solar means fewer new peaker plants and dangerous transmission lines. “We’re over-indexing certain kinds of fire prevention,” Cotter says. “The individual house versus the mass catastrophe. We feel much more comfortable piping natural gas, which we ignite to cook our foods and heat our homes. We know it’s not safe for our planet, nor for the people around it that have to breathe the fumes. But we’re okay doing that because we’ve been doing it for 100 years.” If all of this sounds like a place where an anti-regulatory right might find common ground with an environmentally minded left, well, there are signs of it happening. The deep-red Utah legislature this past winter became the first in the country to allow balcony solar. In the Southeast, a group called Conservatives for Clean Energy has pushed Republican legislators forward on solar power. Its biggest victory came in Florida, where it helped convince Gov. Ron DeSantis to veto anti-solar legislation—in the three years since, the Sunshine State has seen a respectable boom in solar installations. “That allowed us to say, ‘Here’s a Republican governor who helped us save rooftop solar,’” says Mark Fleming, head of CCE and a former aide to former Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). The group focuses on economic arguments—in many rural counties in the Southeast, solar projects are among the biggest taxpayers—but especially when it comes to rooftop solar, its case is partly ideological. “There’s a private property rights thing—an ‘I’ll do what I want on my land’ kind of argument,” Fleming says. Polling has long found that solar power is popular across the political spectrum. My sense, having lived most of my life in dirt-road districts, both red and blue, is that conservatives are often deeply attracted to the idea of producing their own power. If you have your own energy source up on the shingles, then your home really is your castle. But unless you absolutely reject government authority, you still need those permits. One of Fleming’s board members at CCE, Stew Miller, has run a solar installation company in North Carolina’s Research Triangle for 16 years. “Raleigh has instant permitting, which is great,” he said. “But other jurisdictions want us to take 100 photos, even though they may only look at four or five of them. When you’re up on a roof and it’s 95 degrees and they want a picture of every single panel—it gets to be very tedious. Our crews just resent it.” Right now, the world wants to go solar—but the Trump administration is bucking that trend. A few weeks before the November election, Trump declared that solar was “all steel and glass and wires and looks like hell.” (Somewhat mystifyingly, he added, “And you see rabbits, they get caught in it.”) One possibility is that America will simply sit out the global solar boom in the same way Cubans, thanks to endless embargoes, still drive ’57 Chevys. Perhaps, having self-embargoed from the clean energy future, America will someday be a living museum of coal-fired power plants and basement furnaces. If we aren’t going to be left behind, we’re going to have to push. Engineers and scientists have done their job, dropping the price of clean energy 90 percent in a decade. Now environmentalists, entrepreneurs, YIMBYs, advocates for clean air, and local communities have our own job to do: convincing everyone else that rooftop solar is no longer “alternative” energy. As costs have plummeted, solar has gone from being the Whole Foods of energy to the Costco of power—available in bulk, on the shelf, and cheap in most of the world. If you’re feeling helpless against the administration’s attacks on the environment, you might want to join a big fall day of action, Sun Day, which will celebrate clean power, and push for solutions like SolarAPP+. We need to take on utilities, shake up the public utility commissions, and start to get Congress back on the side of the future. I’m hoping that a nationwide celebration of clean energy might prompt the same kind of momentum we’ve seen from housing advocates over the last few years, who’ve made headway pushing for zoning codes to finally be reformed. “We’ve got the hardware solved,” says OpenSolar’s Andrew Birch. “We’ve got the sunshine.

Title: Meta Stock Price Levels to Watch Ahead of Facebook Parent's Earnings Report

Full Content:
Shares in Meta Platforms (META) rose to start the week ahead of the tech giant’s highly anticipated quarterly earnings report, due after Wednesday’s close. Investors will pay close attention to the company’s AI infrastructure spending plans after its Magnificent Seven rival, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), last week raised its 2025 capital expenditures projection by $10 billion to $85 billion. Meta has said it expects to spend $64 billion to $72 billion in capex this year, a figure Wells Fargo analysts expect to reach $76.7 billion in 2026. The stock gained 0.7% on Monday to finish the session near $718. Meta shares have risen 23% since the start of the year as of Monday’s close, boosted by the company’s ongoing efforts to fortify its AI position among its big tech peers. Below, we take a closer look at Meta’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After hitting an all-time high last month, Meta shares have undergone a pullback toward the respected 50-day moving average (MA) ahead of the tech giant’s quarterly results. However, the relative strength index sits above neutral territory, indicating price momentum remains positive. It’s worth pointing out that trading volume in the stock has remained subdued in recent months, suggesting that larger market participants are waiting for the company’s report before deploying further capital. Let’s identify two key overhead areas to watch on Meta’s chart and also locate support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $740. The shares could face significant overhead selling pressure in this location near price action situated just below the stock’s prominent February and June peaks. If the stock moves into price discovery above last month’s record high, investors can forecast a target using bars pattern analysis, a chart technique that analyzes prior trends to project future directional movements. When applying the technique to Meta’s chart, we take the stock’s trend higher from November to February and reposition it from this month’s low. The analysis forecasts a bullish target of around $930, implying 30% upside from Monday’s closing price. We selected this earlier move as it commenced following a retracement to the 50-day MA, providing clues as to how a similar uptrend from the indicator may take shape. During retracements in the stock, it’s initially worth watching the $680 level. This area could provide support near a range of corresponding trading activity that formed on the chart between February and June. Finally, a deeper pullback could see Meta shares revisit lower support around $635, currently just above the upward sloping 200-day MA. Investors may look for entry points in this location near a series of peaks and troughs on the chart from December to May.

Title: Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop ‘Can Be A Tough Place To Work,’ But Its Vision Is Clear, A New Biography Claims: ‘It’s All About Gwyneth’

ByRachel Burchfield ByRachel Burchfield, Contributor. Gwyneth Paltrow attends the 2023 CFDA Awards at American Museum of Natural History on November 6, ... More 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill/FilmMagic) Love her or hate her—when it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, it’s difficult to look away. This has led to the popularity of Paltrow’s lifestyle brand, Goop, since its creation in 2008 as a newsletter written from her kitchen table—and that public fascination has now led to the writing of journalist Amy Odell’s new book Gwyneth: The Biography, out July 29. Odell tells me over Zoom that she spent three years interviewing more than 220 people who knew Paltrow at different stages of her life—ranging from friends to those who worked with her on movie sets to those who worked with her at Goop—“and I wanted to pull back the curtain on how she became so famous and so polarizing,” she says. “She’s someone people are magnetically attracted to, but she’s also been super controversial, and that’s what I think the book does, is really tell that story and also explain how she impacted various industries—entertainment, obviously, but also fashion, beauty and, perhaps most significantly, wellness.” All of Paltrow’s life experiences—from being a 1990s “It Girl” and winning the Academy Award for Best Actress at just 26 years old to being raised as the privileged daughter of Bruce Paltrow and Blythe Danner (as Odell reminds me, “I mean, Steven Spielberg is her godfather”) and so much in between—led to the creation of Goop 17 years ago and its trajectory ever since. While Odell’s book covers so much more than Goop—from her high-profile relationships to her childhood to her acting career—it also leans heavily into Paltrow as an entrepreneur. “She seems really ambitious,” Odell tells me. “She obviously juggles a lot of things capably.” She’s authentic, she adds, and “was never shy about just being who she is. This is all she knows. So I think that really works in her favor.” Gwyneth Paltrow attends Veuve Clicquot Celebrates 250th Anniversary with Solaire Exhibition on ... More October 25, 2022 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/WireImage) It’s nearly impossible to separate Paltrow the businesswoman from Paltrow the woman, and Gwyneth paints a holistic portrait of the 52-year-old’s life. Of Goop, Odell says, “Gwyneth made it very appealing through her taste—her really good taste—and she made it a world that people wanted to be a part of.” At the office, Paltrow is known mostly as “GP”; she often rolls up to the Goop offices—wearing, of course, Goop’s G. Label clothing line—and parks her white Range Rover in a spot labeled “Reserved for G-Spot.” As a boss, “Some people find it to be quite challenging,” Odell says of Paltrow. “But I think the good thing about working for her is that her vision is very clear. She has this extraordinary taste—a really sophisticated aesthetic and aspirational aesthetic that she brought to the wellness industry. I think that’s, in part, what made Goop and Goop’s wellness content so appealing. It was this gorgeous, aspirational aesthetic she brought to it.” Dr. Ella Bell and Gwyneth Paltrow, CEO and Founder of Goop, speak onstage during day three of The ... More MAKERS Conference 2024 at The Beverly Hilton on February 29, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for The 2024 MAKERS Conference) Right down to the company’s name, Paltrow is in the midst of it—Goop was chosen as a moniker because of Paltrow’s initials, GP, and the perceived fact that companies with double Os—think Google or Yahoo!—did well. According to Odell’s book, Paltrow initially thought the name was “stupid and funny,” and she has also said in the past that Goop was “an old nickname” (her father, Bruce, apparently used to call her “Goopie”). True to Paltrow’s authentic nature, two Miramax executives told Odell that they remembered Paltrow using a Goop@aol.com email address back in the 1990s. She is who she is. As a boss—Paltrow has served as CEO of Goop since 2016, eight years after founding it—she has “very strong ideas and a very clear vision,” Odell says. “The problem is, she wanted to do everything, and she wanted to do it all perfectly.” Paltrow, known as a perfectionist, has also seen Goop spread itself rather thin—from beauty to fashion to wellness to food to newsletters to podcasts to Netflix shows, there are few verticals that the company hasn’t touched. “So people felt overworked, and there wasn’t a lot of money for everything they were doing—some people felt like they didn’t have enough budget for freelancers and things like that,” Odell says. “So there’s a lot of work to be done, and there’s this perfectionism that she wants to achieve. So people felt pressure from that.” Gwyneth Paltrow, Powerhouse Brand of the Year Award recipient, attends The Daily Front Row's Seventh ... More Annual Fashion Los Angeles Awards at The Beverly Hills Hotel on April 23, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Daily Front Row) If you walk into Paltrow’s office, she wants you to get directly to the point, Odell says, and “then you could just go.” When Paltrow shines her light on someone, “it feels amazing and people really thrive, but there’s a fear that it’s going to be taken away,” Odell tells me. If it does get taken away, in comes the stress, and “that stress could just permeate the office environment.” Some, Odell says, called Paltrow “icy and cold and aloof,” drawing comparisons to Vogue’s departing editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, whom Odell also profiled in a 2022 biography. “I think it can be a tough place to work,” Odell says. “That said—[it’s] not for everybody. Some people found it to be really tough. Some people ignored the chaos and were fine, and people said they liked that the vision was very clear, which was that it’s Gwyneth. It’s all about Gwyneth.” Much like when Paltrow shines her light on an employee and they feel her warmth, so it is when Paltrow promotes Goop’s products—that’s when they do the best. “They do sell,” Odell says. “People want to buy what she’s wearing. She looks great in the clothes, and she looks great wearing the mascara. So she’s very powerful in that way. But what if she gets tired of it? People tell me she doesn’t love doing the social media content—not that I can blame her. She’s got a lot on her plate.” Gwyneth Paltrow, CEO and founder of lifestyle juggernaut Goop, makes her first appearance in the ... More Tank as a guest Shark on 'Shark Tank.' (Christopher Willard/ABC via Getty Images) Goop came about when Paltrow was living in London with her ex-husband Chris Martin and their two young kids: Apple, born in 2004, and Moses, born in 2006. After becoming a mother, Paltrow dialed back her work as an actress, which seems to be revving up again after both kids have now gone away to college. That leaves questions about the future of Goop—after all, what is Goop without Paltrow? “I’m not saying Gwyneth is not there for the company, but if she changes her mind—so the investors I spoke to, they did not see a super bright future for Goop, I have to say,” Odell says. Before Goop, Paltrow threw her star power behind brands like American Express and Estée Lauder before she realized, “Hey, why am I using my image to promote these other brands when I can use it to build my own brand?” Odell says of Paltrow’s possible thought patterns during that time period. “Which is incredibly savvy. And I think, in that way, she’s like the original influencer, because she realized that she could use her image to drive purchases, and she did really early affiliate deals before anyone was calling them affiliate deals, and now affiliate deals are this huge industry.” “I think she’s been so strategic,” Odell tells me. Gwyneth Paltrow celebrates the launch of good.clean.goop at Goop on October 18, 2023 in Santa ... More Monica, California. (Photo by Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for good.clean.goop) Since its newsletter origins, it has focused on the aforementioned beauty (Goop Beauty and Good Clean Goop), fashion (G. Label), wellness (Goop Wellness) and food (Goop Kitchen) verticals; it has had a Netflix series, a podcast, dipped its toe into home furnishings and courted controversy for its perceived pseudoscience and boundary-pushing products, like a viral candle advertised as smelling like Paltrow’s orgasm. Many people told Odell that Goop has spread itself too thin, “that they did too much,” she says. “They raised a lot of money, too. One expert I talked to said they probably never should have raised that much money.” Odell’s many interviews led her to believe that “they can keep going probably for a very long time, just as they are today,” she says. “I think it’s probably really up to Gwyneth—do I want to keep doing this? Do I want to have a little bit more flexibility and maybe license more of this business? I think it’s really up to her.” In September 2024, Goop let go 18 percent of its staff—affecting about 40 people—followed by a second round of layoffs last November. The goal of the reduction is to “optimize operational efficiency and revenue growth in our key verticals of beauty and fashion,” a Goop spokesperson told Business Insider. The spokesperson declined to provide specific revenue figures, but said revenue grew year-over-year in 2023 and was on track to grow again in 2024. While the spokesperson declined to say if Goop—a privately-held company—is profitable, Business Insider did report in November that Goop Beauty revenue was up 21 percent over the year prior, and the fashion brand G. Label was up 45 percent. The outlet reported that Goop has raised more than $140 million and was most recently valued at $433 million (per PitchBook); last fall, Paltrow told WWD that, after the first round of layoffs, Goop was “back in growth mode.” “What I’m most excited about is the refining of the brand that we’re doing—our hyperfocus on beauty, fashion and food,” Paltrow told Fortune in March. “Those are the verticals where we’re seeing incredible product-market fit and margin. Food, beauty and G. Label all grew exponentially last year. Since COVID, we’ve had to stay so agile, and getting to the other side of that and focusing on our strengths—there’s power in that.” Founder and CEO of Goop Gwyneth Paltrow speaks onstage during 'The Rise of Goop: Building a ... More Tastemaking Empire' at Vanity Fair's 6th Annual New Establishment Summit at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on October 22, 2019 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Vanity Fair) Paltrow called layoffs “painful” and told the publication that “it’s always a very difficult thing to do, but sometimes for the rigor of the business, it’s necessary.” “I hate doing that more than anything in the world,” she continued, adding that Goop was “very, very close” to being profitable, “which is incredibly exciting, and a big milestone.” Not bad for a newsletter sharing recipes and recommendations with no monetization strategy in place in the company’s early days. Back then, Odell writes, “the whole spectacle of Goop was just plain entertaining, like a very curated look into her life.” Speaking of a look into her life—and into Paltrow’s influence—after she announced in 2014 that she and Martin were separating after 10 years of marriage, famously calling it a “conscious uncoupling,” Goop.com “received so much traffic, the site crashed,” Odell writes. As the company monetized and got into e-commerce, “I didn’t understand anything,” Paltrow said, as quoted in Gwyneth. “I didn’t finish college. I didn’t go to business school. I didn’t go up through a corporate environment.” Going forward, as Paltrow said herself, Goop’s strategy is to niche down on beauty, fashion and food: “The best thing to do is just embrace your niche, and scale can come from that,” Paltrow said at the 2024 Forbes Power Women’s Summit. “A lot of mistakes have come from me not understanding that.” “We have a lot of intention around what we’re doing, and I’m proud that we’re still alive and kicking,” she added.

More Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 day two at Amazon Port Plaza Stage on June 18, 2024 in Cannes, France. (Photo by Marc Piasecki/Getty Images) If Goop could go back in time, it should have done this from the start, Odell tells me. “People I talked to said she might’ve been better off just trying to prove one vertical first—just do beauty and kill it in beauty, and then maybe you iterate from there,” she says, citing Kim Kardashian’s Skims and its commitment to shapewear as an example. While Skims was founded by Kardashian, it’s not all about Kardashian, “and that makes you stronger, I think, as a celebrity brand,” Odell says. With Goop, “I think what happened there—this is my informed view on it—is that they built out all those different businesses, the clothing, the beauty, the events, all of that,” Odell says. “And they just grew too big. It was just too expensive to do all of that, a lot to build out a staff, to do a beauty line, to do a clothing line, a staff to do content. So they cut back because they needed to. The expenses were just too high.” As Odell writes in Gwyneth, “Not only was the pace and breadth of work unsustainable for employees, it would also prove unsustainable for Goop.” “[But] they’re still there and the company’s still going,” Odell tells me. “And Gwyneth is still the CEO.” These days, Odell was told the Goop Kitchen is the company’s biggest moneymaker—hence food making the cut alongside beauty and fashion as the path forward. When asked about a possible exit someday, Paltrow told Fortune, “I’m in building mode and not thinking about an exit right now. I don’t even really want to think about it for another three years, or even start thinking about it.” Gwyneth Paltrow and Michaela Boehm speak onstage during the goop lab Special Screening in Los ... More Angeles, California on January 21, 2020. (Photo by Rachel Murray/Getty Images) It remains uncertain what will come of Goop, but what Odell knows? “Whatever happens with Goop, Gwyneth will be fine,” she writes in the book. “She has a way of emerging victorious from any calamity.” Goop’s success, in large part, boils down to Paltrow and the public’s inability to take its eyes off her, a woman who Odell writes possesses “an enduring level of status and fascination few ever achieve.” “Goop was a window into a certain elitism,” she continues in the book. “And people couldn’t look away.” To a degree, they still can’t.

Title: Up 80% This Year What's Next For Celestica Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/29/up-80-this-year-whats-next-for-celestica-stock/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T09:30:29Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Celestica (NYSE:CLS) has recently been experiencing significant growth — the stock has risen 80% year-to-date and has more than tripled in value over the past year. What factors are contributing to this increase? The company, recognized for its electronics manufacturing and supply chain services, is benefiting from a surge in demand for AI-powered networking equipment and cloud infrastructure, driven by major technology companies. This upswing is spurring rapid expansion in its Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) division — a segment that encompasses everything from servers and storage to high-performance networking hardware. In Q1 2025, CCS revenue reached $1.84 billion, an increase of 28% compared to the previous year. The key AI-related offerings within this segment include servers, integrated rack solutions, and high-performance networking switches, all of which are essential for modern AI workloads. The extensive AI boom is projected to maintain demand. Major technology firms are currently engaged in unprecedented cycles of infrastructure investment. Amazon is anticipated to allocate as much as $105 billion for capital expenditures in 2025. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are estimated to invest $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion, respectively — much of this directed towards AI infrastructure. This trend should bolster demand for Celestica. How does the stock’s fundamental outlook appear, and will its momentum continue? The stock appears relatively expensive — making it a costly choice to purchase at its current price of around $170. We identify some minor concerns regarding CLS stock. Our conclusion is derived by comparing the current valuation of CLS stock with its operational performance in recent years, in addition to its current and historical financial status. Our assessment of Celestica along crucial metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a strong operational performance and financial health, as outlined below. However, if you are looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also see: QuantumScape: QS Stock To $0? Celestica’s valuation seems high when assessed against the wider market. While its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.0 is less than the S&P 500’s 3.1, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47.8 is considerably higher than the benchmark’s 22.8. Nevertheless, this is supported by the company's robust recent top-line growth. Revenues have risen at an average annual rate of 19.3% over the past three years, significantly surpassing the S&P 500’s 5.3%. Over the last year, Celestica’s Revenues increased by 21% to reach $10 billion, while the S&P 500 only managed a modest growth of 4.4%. However, its profitability remains behind. The net income margin over the past year was only 4.1% (compared to 11.9% for the S&P 500). Nonetheless, operating performance is showing positive trends, with Celestica achieving a record adjusted operating margin of 7.1% in the latest quarter, up from 5.9% in Q1 2024. This upward margin trend and strong revenue should, in time, lead to higher earnings, potentially justifying the company's elevated valuation. From a financial health perspective, Celestica appears robust, with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 4.8%, comfortably below the S&P 500 average of 22.6%. The company maintains a moderate cash reserve that constitutes 5.2% of its total assets. However, CLS stock has historically demonstrated sensitivity to market downturns. For example, during the Covid-19 market crash, CLS plummeted 69% compared to a 33.9% drop in the S&P 500. Likewise, in 2022, amid inflation-related shocks, the stock fell 35.6% during a broader market correction, exceeding the S&P’s 25.4% decline. Additional risks also exist. The company has a significant manufacturing presence in Asia (approximately two-thirds of production), and tariffs imposed by the U.S. government may elevate supply chain costs and exert pressure on profit margins. The high valuation of CLS stock may restrict its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an effective strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: As if the trade war never happened, stocks could pull off a feat not seen since the late-1990s boom
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/29/stock-market-outlook-sp500-forecast-7100-trump-trade-war-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T06:02:00Z
Full Content:
Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The stock market has been on a hot streak lately, notching record high after record high, and some bulls on Wall Street think the party isn’t over. That marks a stunning reversal from the panic that gripped investors in April, when President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs shocked the world. Stocks, Treasury bonds, and the dollar crashed. Markets started pricing in a recession, and analysts slashed their forecasts. But Trump put his most aggressive tariff rates on hold, corporate earnings remained robust, consumers stayed resilient, and stocks rebounded. Even foreign investors jumped back into U.S. markets. Meanwhile, his administration has negotiated several trade deals, including one with the European Union on Sunday that removes the threat of a damaging trade war. Now that the fog of war is lifting, upbeat forecasts that predated Liberation Day are back, meaning stocks could put up big numbers again—as if the tariff shock from a few months ago was all just a bad dream. On Monday, Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus hiked his S&P 500 price target for this year to 7,100 from 5,950, reinstating the outlook he initially made in December 2024. “This year reminds us of the classic Charles Dickens quote, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,'” he said in his latest note. “Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes at least for now.” He cited progress on trade negotiations, strong corporate earnings, and the Federal Reserve’s deft handling of monetary policy, which cooled inflation without causing a recession. If the S&P 500 hits 7,100 this year, it would represent a gain of about 21% for 2025, marking a third straight year with a surge of more than 20%. That hasn’t happened since the late 1990s, when the U.S. economy and the stock market boomed. Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said the S&P 500 could reach 7,200 by mid-2026, explaining that he is starting to lean closer to that more optimistic “bull case” scenario. He cited strong earnings as well as AI adoption, the weak dollar, Trump’s tax cuts, pent-up demand, and expectations for Fed rate cuts in early 2026. Another member of the 7,000 club is Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo Securities’ head of equity strategy, who has stuck by his S&P 500 forecast of 7,007 even during the trade war. Last week, he reaffirmed it, predicting big tech companies will continue fueling the stock market’s rally despite Trump’s trade policies. “What we’re seeing is the winners continue to win,” he told Bloomberg. “The uber-cap companies have the higher margins, are gaining more market share. There is a real secular trend in AI that will continue.” And over the longer term, this decade still looks like it will be another “roaring 20s,” according to market veteran Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. On Monday, he backed his thesis, which he first posited in August 2020, as productivity advances, a wave of capital outlays, and the endurance of consumer spending will keep stocks buoyant. “If the remainder of the decade continues to play out as the Roaring 2020s, we predict that the S&P 500 will start the next decade at 10,000,” Yardeni wrote in a note. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: SharpLink stakes big on Ethereum: Are institutions moving away from BTC?

What could this mean for supply, staking, and Ethereum’s price ceiling? SharpLink Gaming has ramped up to over 438,000 ETH, signaling deep institutional interest and long-term conviction. Analysts warn of a possible short-term dip before the next breakout. While the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin [BTC] amid growing institutional accumulation, a quiet but significant shift is unfolding in the Ethereum [ETH] space. SharpLink Gaming, a prominent player in gaming and data analytics, has deepened its Ethereum commitment by purchasing an additional 77,210 ETH over the weekend, worth approximately $295 million, per Arkham. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain also confirmed the purchase, which has pushed SharpLink’s total Ethereum holdings to 438,017 ETH, now worth approximately $1.69 billion. Source: Lookonchain/X A large portion of this stash is staked via platforms such as Figment and Hoppers DApp, signaling a long-term approach rather than speculative accumulation. In fact, SharpLink itself emphasized Ethereum’s 24/7 availability compared to traditional banking hours, pointing to the agility and scalability that make ETH an attractive reserve asset for modern firms. They further added, Source: SharpLink/X Echoing the growing confidence in Ethereum, crypto analyst Crypt Rover posted on X that such large-scale accumulation is a strong signal of deepening institutional inflows. He even predicted that ETH could be on track to hit $10,000, as demand surges and long-term holdings tighten supply. This shows that with Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin serving as chairman and former BlackRock strategist Joseph Chalom as co-CEO, SharpLink is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and Web3. If it fulfills its acquisition goal, the company would hold over 1 million ETH, or approximately 1% of the total supply. According to ETH Strategic Reserve data, SharpLink is now the second-largest holder of ETH, trailing only Bitmine Immersion Tech, which holds 566,000 ETH. This coincided with ETH trading at $3,871.72, up 1.12% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Technical indicators like the RSI also support a bullish case for Ethereum, showing that buyers currently have the upper hand. Source: Trading View The community also seems to have appreciated this move by SharpLink, as noted by one X user, who said, “$ETH will Moon!” Echoing similar sentiments, another page — WISE, added, “Oufff so bullish” Thus, with both sentiment and fundamentals lining up, Ethereum’s current trajectory could be signaling a larger trend in crypto capital allocation. However, Alphractal’s Liquidation Heatmap indicates a cluster of open long positions, hinting that a short-term dip may precede Ethereum’s next breakout as reported by AMBCrypto.

Title: Web 3.0 Founders Must Learn From AI Industry Success
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/28/web-3-0-founders-must-learn-from-ai-industry-success/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T03:40:35Z
Full Content:
Discords and X threads aren’t fooling investors anymore. Web 3.0 founders must look towards AI to survive. Web 3.0 founders have to pivot. The AI (artificial intelligence) industry has demonstrated itself to be far more apt at innovating than Web 3.0, which as an industry must accept defeat in a way and reorganize. It would behoove AI founders to take a page out of the book of big AI companies, which have impacted lives and scooped up a big market share in short order – leaving crypto very much in the dust when it comes to the mindshare of crypto in the global consciousness versus AI. Web 3.0 founders must ask themselves, ‘What can we learn?’ As AI becomes more powerful, and it will do so quickly, Web 3.0 will quickly become a subservient industry, dependent upon the whims of the almighty big technology corporations in control of AI technology. Web 3.0 will likely only become lucrative and impactful by partnering with AI companies. Web 3.0’s decentralization, which has resulted in thousands of projects promising all sorts of decentralized versions of apps that already exist, has led to the general public – including investors – not understanding which projects are for real. Investors simply don’t know which projects can achieve results or are even offering a solution to a real problem. DAOs, DeFi protocols and metaverse land rushes are largely a cacophony of Discord servers, Telegram groups and X threads. For many Western investors, these business models are completely foreign. The business models of AI companies, including startups, are far more familiar. In addition, Web 3.0 has gained a bit of a reputation for being associated with hype and scams. The AI industry, on the other hand, has forged a clearer path towards deals that make a difference. AI companies aren’t shilling tokens based on future promises, writing convoluted whitepapers and posting endlessly online. They’re building groundbreaking technology from the ground up. In the AI industry, the cream has risen quickly to the top. The world knows that it is companies like xAI, OpenAI, Google and others that dominate the marketplace. Investors know that real innovation doesn’t come from a 10,000 NFT (non-fungible token) collection. BlackRock will tokenize bonds, not NFTs. Partners want to make deals with the AI behemoths building out the world-changing infrastructure, such as cloud providers, chipmakers or platforms like xAI’s Grok, which has revolutionized the way in which humanity seeks out information. Unfortunately for those of us in the Web 3.0 space – for now at least – these companies are building the future, not Web 3.0 startups. Centralization is winning the day over decentralization. The fragmentation in Web 3.0 – the fierce competition over so little – is not nearly as appetizing to investors and strategic partners as AI monopolies. Web 3.0 companies should start looking to partner with those companies sitting on a vast GPU supply or a proprietary data organization. These are the companies – the ones that control algorithms – getting inventor funds. A new way forward for crypto Web 3.0 founders are left with no other option than to pivot. The industry has to face it and move towards a new strategy. Big money has found it difficult to navigate the decentralized web of Web 3.0 companies. Instead, centralized powerhouses are the ones building the future, and they could step into the crypto arena at any time and potentially outcompete crypto native incumbents. It’s time for crypto to move on from its messaging chat and X strategy, as well as the promises of decentralization, and start working the phones to get into the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies touching technology. It’s high time to deliver. The idealism of Web 3.0 is proving not to mesh with reality. The quest for decentralization, ownership and democratized value creation has stalled. In the future, Web 3.0 might further fragment. The biggest blockchains, such as Ethereum and Solana, will begin to pin their fates on centralized solutions, increasingly looking like the tech gatekeepers they once billed themselves as disrupting. The blockchains of tomorrow will exist as integrations into the traditional financial and technology giants, which are looking for supply chain tracking and similar solutions. For the blockchain world, these solutions are the quickest way to real-world utility and a monopoly. The more lofty solutions, such as decentralized data storage, are not making much progress when it comes to market share. Memecoins, redundant DeFi protocols and incomplete metaverses are already suffering under the strain of zero sum competition between one another. There is no crypto community. The incestuous strategic partnerships of crypto projects with each other have resulted in limited innovation. It’s time for Web 3.0 founders to make a change. Billion-dollar partnerships are made via access to C-Suites of the world’s biggest companies – not in the world of hashtags or virtual land. The Web 3.0 companies that don’t adapt to the fact that Web 3.0 has fallen far behind the AI industry in terms of innovation won’t be around for long.

The New York Post is identifying the Manhattan shooter who allegedly opened fire in the office building housing Blackstone and NFL headquarters as a 27-year-old Las Vegas man named Shane Tamura. Tamura allegedly walked into the building and opened fire around 6:30 p.m. and was found dead shortly thereafter. FOX 5 New York noted that Tamura had a “concealed carry permit from Las Vegas” on his person. Breitbart News initially reported the number of shooting victims as three, consisting of one police officer and two civilians. However, numbers were later updated to show at least six were shot, including another police officer who lost his life. At 9:17 p.m. FOX New York noted that at least three of the shooting victims had died. No motive for the shooting has been reported.

Update: FOX News is reporting the number of shooting victims in Monday’s Manhattan attack now sits at six, two police officers among them. Earlier reports indicated two civilians and one officer were shot. Those same early reports indicated the police officer would survive, but FOX News is reporting one of the two wounded officers is deceased. *****Original story below***** At least three people were shot, including a police officer, in the lobby of a midtown Manhattan office that houses Blackstone and the NFL headquarters. The shooting allegedly occurred around 6:30 p.m. The New York Post reported that the gunman is dead — that he “turned the gun on himself” after shooting individuals. NBC New York pointed out that the attacker was armed with an “assault” style rifle. Ironically, Mike-Bloomberg affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety ranks New York as No. 4 in the country for stringent gun control in part because the state bans “assault weapons.” New York also has heightened background check requirements, a red flag law, a ban on “high capacity” magazines and bump stocks, and many other gun controls.

Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Spot Ethereum ETFs register 16 consecutive days of inflows, driven by institutional whales and corporate treasury firms' appetite for ETH. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are close to breaking the $10 billion mark in inflows this month, as BlackRock’s ETHA makes its way to the spot of fourth-largest ETF by inflows in the last 30 days. According to Farside Investors’ data, spot Ethereum ETFs accumulated $9.3 billion in inflows as of July 25. This represents a 120% increase from the $4.2 billion registered on July 1, marking 16 consecutive days of inflows. The average daily inflow is $233 million, which would total over $930 million in the four trading days left in July. Even if the average doesn’t repeat itself, the ETFs require $162.5 million daily to reach $10 billion, and 13 out of 16 trading days with inflows have surpassed this amount. ETHA leads the inflows by a large margin, accounting for $9.34 billion in total flows, nearly four times the $2.35 billion in inflows of Fidelity’s FETH. In July, the BlackRock fund represented 91% of the total. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that ETFs took $97.6 billion in inflows in the past 30 days. ETHA took the spot as the fourth-largest ETF, showing nearly $3.9 billion in inflows, roughly 4% of the total. Moreover, Balchunas noted that ETHA registered the 17th-largest trading volume among ETFs as of July 28, 11:25 am ET. He added: “$ETHA 17th most traded ETF today Top 0.4% of all ETFs, first time I recall seeing it in there. Given it is up 5% today and still pretty new a lot of this volume is gonna convert to inflows.” As of press time, ETHA’s daily trading volume stands at $1.35 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, assessed that the rising inflows are driven by both institutional whales and corporate treasury firms’ appetite for ETH. In a note, he said this growth reflects the increased conviction in Ethereum’s utility, sustainability, and long-term staying power, particularly due to its use in tokenization, stablecoins, and on-chain settlement. He concluded: “The rise of Ether ETF AUM to over $20 billion, which represents almost 5% of Ether’s total market cap, speaks to this growing strategic asset role it’s now occupying in institutional portfolios.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) is once again at the center of investor attention, pulling in a staggering $1.59 billion in inflows over the past week. This marks the second-largest weekly inflow in Ethereum’s history, amid growing optimism that U.S. regulators will soon approve a spot Ethereum ETF. Overall, digital asset investment products attracted $1.9 billion, marking 15 consecutive weeks of positive flows. This surge in capital has pushed Ethereum’s price up 62% this month to $3,900, positioning it just below the critical $4,000 breakout level. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETPs faced $175 million in outflows, signaling a capital rotation from BTC to ETH and other altcoins. Analysts point to the passage of the Genius and Clarity Acts in the U.S. as key drivers of this trend, enhancing regulatory clarity for altcoin investment vehicles. Institutional investors are doubling down. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) surged past $10 billion in AUM, becoming the third-fastest-growing ETF globally, while the firm raised its ETH holdings to $10.47 billion, with 100% of its crypto exposure now allocated to Ethereum. Simultaneously, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming purchased 77,210 ETH worth approximately $295 million, raising its total ETH treasury to over 438,000 ETH. This single purchase surpassed the network’s entire 30-day ETH issuance, underscoring the aggressive accumulation trend among institutions. Ethereum’s rally is further supported by bullish technical signals. A “golden cross” pattern emerged, and the MACD shows strong upward momentum, despite an overbought RSI reading of 82.07, a level often associated with potential price pullbacks. Solana and XRP also saw inflows of $311 million and $189 million, respectively, while Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash experienced minor outflows. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s on-chain activity surged 288%, reinforcing confidence in the network’s role as the leading smart contract and DeFi platform. As regulatory momentum builds and ETF approval appears within reach, Ethereum’s dominance in institutional portfolios signals a pivotal moment for altcoin adoption—though short-term volatility remains a factor to watch.

Title: BNY Mellon Wealth CIO Shares One Quiet Power Behind Smart Investing

ByGemma Allen ByGemma Allen, Contributor. Sinead Colton Grant - Chief Investment Officer BNY Wealth poses in NYC - 2024 As a child growing up in 1980’s Ireland, Sinead Colton Grant didn’t dream of a career in finance. Instead, her journey to the top ranks of Wall Street started with an unexpected monetary gain. She was a college student headed to Italy on a summer trip when she noticed a pleasant surprise in her finances. The devaluation of the currency just before she left, meant she had a little more Italian lira than she expected. For Colton Grant, this little holiday windfall sparked a lifelong fascination with global finance and smart investing, that would see her rise from FX sales on a London trading floor to become the first female Chief Investment Officer in BNY Wealth history. Her role oversees key decisions at one of the world’s largest private banks. But she shares, that for her, the numbers and portfolios have only ever been part of the story. “Investment isn’t just about returns,” she says. “It’s about trust. Without trust, even the best strategies fall flat.” While she crafts strategies for some of the world’s wealthiest people and foundations, she’s equally attuned to the changing face of wealth, who’s wielding it and how that changing client profile makes trust more important than ever before. I sat down with Colton Grant to discuss her rise through the ranks of an industry where she has often been the only woman in the room, her take on the current investment landscape and how she is witnessing and championing a historic shift in who holds financial power. Colton Grant’s career path has followed the broad arc of globalization and financial markets. After beginning in FX trading and currency management, she pivoted into asset allocation and multi-asset portfolios, before joining Barclays Global Investors and then BlackRock. She views those early years as formative, not just in building technical knowledge but in realizing that at the heart of strong investment strategies is the necessity of clear, human communication. “You can have an amazing investment process, but if you can’t articulate it in a way people understand, no one is going to invest with you,” she shares. That skill, which in practice means translating complex systems into human stories, became a cornerstone of her leadership style and one that would see her move between locations and offices before landing in Mellon Capital. There, she helped develop one of the ten largest liquid alternatives mutual funds in the U.S., before joining BNY Wealth as Deputy CIO and stepping into the CIO seat in 2020 at the height of a global pandemic. Sinead Coltan Grant presenting to BNY clients in Boston with guest, Dan Clifton from Eurasia Group, ... More 2025 Colton Grant shares that while on reflection the pandemic era feels like a fever dream, it marked a unique moment in the investment ecosystem, when the personal, political, and economic suddenly converged. For a leader like Colton Grant, who had built her career on human connection and trust, her appointment as CIO couldn’t have come at a more defining moment. "Managing wealth, is above all, a human business with trust at the center,” she shares, “Our clients aren’t just investing for themselves. They’re thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations.” Increasingly, she notes, those conversations are being driven by a new generation, and a new type of investment profile - women. It’s a shift Colton Grant sees first hand, with a front-row seat to a growing wealth transfer, marked by a significant increase in female participation in angel investing, venture capital, and broader financial decision-making. She shares that this represents more than just a demographic shift. “I meet with more women thinking about the financial legacy of their families, often over generations. It's a mindset shift, and one that’s starting to show up in how capital moves and who’s deciding where it goes. We are now at a time when most of the wealth from the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers is moving into the hands of women,” she continues. “That means more women will be making, or solely responsible for major financial decisions, many for the first time.” Catherine Keating Former CEO BNY Wealth and colleagues Ring bell at NYSE 2022 For Colton Grant, this means that representation isn’t merely a moral imperative, it’s a strategic advantage. "Our clients want to see themselves reflected in the people managing their money. Diverse leadership teams make better decisions. It’s that simple." That also means that helping more women step into investing has become both a personal mission and an economic imperative. “Money means freedom," she says. "Our financial markets have built tremendous wealth over time, and it’s important that more women participate in that wealth creation by investing. I understand why it makes people nervous, but it doesn't have to be complicated. You can start small, with methods like a low-cost S&P index exposure which can generate strong returns over time." What she wants women to realize is that the ripple effects of investing extend far beyond individual portfolios. Women's increased participation creates a flywheel that benefits the broader macroeconomy. "The data shows that more female investors also lead to more female founders receiving seed capital for their businesses. This is vital given that only 2% of overall venture capital dollars go to female-founded start-ups." Asked about her advice to women with the resources to invest but not sure how or where to start? Her reply echoes the age old investment mantra: there will never be a perfect moment. "Time in the market beats timing the market. So just get started," she says. As for this moment we are in right now, marked by an unprecedented level of workplace and market uncertainty, Colton Grant remains bullish on U.S. markets, citing strong underlying fundamentals, backed by innovation capacity, productivity growth, and healthy earning margins. Her investment philosophy doesn't listen to political noise. "You don't invest with your politics," she says, "You focus on the fundamentals." Sinead Colton Grant, Chief Investment Officer, was featured on Fox Business ‘Making Money with ... More Charles Payne’ discussing her market outlook and the future of US exceptionalism. July 1, 2025 When asked where she thinks the opportunity lies, she shares that there are some clear emerging trends reshaping the industry. Private markets, which have long been the exclusive domain of institutional investors, are now more accessible through evergreen investment vehicles. Digital assets are gaining traction, particularly among younger generations, and, of course, artificial intelligence is a key factor. "2025 will be a 'show me' year," she predicts. "It's not just about tech companies, it's about how AI-driven productivity starts to ripple through sectors like healthcare, energy, and beyond." When asked what advice she’d offer women entering finance, Colton Grant boils it downto three things: Speak up, advocate for yourself- don’t assume people will notice your work. Go before you’re ready- don’t wait to tick every box. Know the difference between mentors and sponsors - mentors offer guidance, but sponsors open doors. Above all, however, Colton Grant shares that her trajectory - from a curious college student intrigued by currency shifts, to a leader at the forefront of finance’s biggest transformation - boils down to one undeniable truth: success and smart investing hinges on trust. As she puts it, “people buy people. Trust is everything.” For Sinead Colton Grant, aligning trust is more than virtue, it’s a movement led increasingly by women like her who are reshaping finance from every role: client, leader, founder, and investor.

Title: Watch These Microsoft Stock Price Levels as Tech Giant Set to Report Earnings

Microsoft (MSFT) shares fell slightly on Monday but remain near a record high as investors await the scheduled release of the company's quarterly results on Wednesday. Just as with other Magnificent Seven companies, investors will be seeking updates on the tech giant’s spending plans as the AI arms race among tech rivals intensifies. Last week, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) lifted its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion, up from its prior forecast of $75 billion. Microsoft shares slipped 0.2% to close Monday's session at $512.50. The stock has gained nearly 22% since the start of the year, boosted by strong growth in the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment and successful efforts to integrate AI into its Copilot chatbot and Azure cloud platform. Below, we break down the technicals on Microsoft’s chart and point out price levels worth watching out for. Since gapping decisively above the 200-day moving average (MA) in early May, Microsoft shares have trended steadily higher within as ascending channel. During this time, the 50-day MA crossed above the 200-day MA to form a bullish golden cross, while the relative strength index has remained near overbought territory to signal strong price momentum. It’s also worth noting that volatility has fallen sharply in the stock since it bottomed in early April as shown by the average true range percent indicator—a technical tool that signals how much an asset typically moves as a percentage of its price. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential upside target on Microsoft’s chart if the shares continue trending higher and also identify crucial support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast a potential upside target in the stock by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis to Microsoft’s chart, we calculate the height of the ascending channel from its low to high rounded to the nearest dollar and add that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline. For instance, we add $93 to $527, which projects a target of $620, about 21% above today's closing price. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should watch for a retest of crucial support around $468. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near last year’s prominent July swing high. Finally, a decisive close below this level could see Microsoft shares drop to $430. This location finds a confluence of support from the closely watched 200-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a series of corresponding price action on the chart extending back to March last year.

Major U.S. equities indexes finished Monday mixed following the weekend announcement of a trade agreement with the European Union. The new trading week promises plenty of economic and financial news, including the Federal Reserve's interest-rate announcement, the latest jobs and inflation data, and a flood of earnings reports from major companies in the tech sector and beyond. The S&P 500 eked out a gain of less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3%. Both indexes were at record highs. The Dow slipped 0.1%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged more than 10%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance. Supermicro is set to release its quarterly results on Aug. 5. Monday's push higher for the stock followed reports that President Donald Trump has loosened restrictions on technological exports to China in a move to bolster trade negotiations with the country. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained 4.3%. According to reports, AMD raised pricing on its Instinct MI350 AI chip, suggesting the company is confident in the capacity of its high-end product to compete with offerings from rival Nvidia (NVDA). UBS analysts boosted their price target on AMD stock, pointing to improving expectations for the semiconductor maker's upcoming earnings report, slated for Aug. 5. Nike (NKE) shares treaded 3.9% higher Monday after JPMorgan upgraded the footwear and apparel maker's stock to "overweight" from "neutral." Analysts highlighted Nike's progress on its multiyear recovery plan, which includes inventory alignment and new performance products, with particular opportunities surrounding next year's soccer World Cup in the U.S. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, suffered the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock, dropping nearly 11%. With the move lower on Monday, Albemarle stock gave back the gains posted over the past week and a half after reports that a large lithium miner in China had suspended operations, helping alleviate concerns about oversupply in the market for the key battery component. Albemarle and other producers have been working to cut costs as they navigate a prolonged slump in lithium prices. Revvity (RVTY) shares fell 8.3% following the medical device maker's quarterly earnings release. Although second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share topped consensus estimates, the maker of instruments and reagents for drug discovery and other healthcare research lowered its full-year profit outlook, citing expected softness in its immunodiagnostics business in China. Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded Centene (CNC) stock to "neutral" from "overweight," and shares of the health insurer slipped 5.4%. Analysts pointed to headwinds related to Centene's business in the healthcare exchange and Medicaid markets. At the beginning of July, Centene withdrew its full-year guidance, citing cost and enrollment pressure.

The mood on Wall Street feels a bit like discovering that nothing is broken after a hard fall. U.S. stocks are near record highs to start the week, reflecting optimism about a range of topics that investors have had to ponder. The European Union and the U.S. struck a deal over the weekend, easing corporate anxiety of a protracted trade war. With some of that uncertainty cleared, and earnings so far coming on strong, some analysts are sounding more upbeat than they have for a while. Oppenheimer on Monday lifted its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 7100 from 5950, among the highest held by major Wall Street brokerage firms. The outlook—which brings its target back to where it was to start the year—implies upside of about 11% from Friday's close. Morgan Stanley said the probability of its bull case, which puts the S&P 500 at 7200 in the middle of 2026, was firming up. Numbers like those are a long way from the levels below 5000 seen in April after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement spooked investors. The next few days will test that optimism. "Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes, at least for now," Oppenheimer wrote. The Federal Open Market Committee's next decision on interest rates is due Wednesday, and Big Tech giants with a combined market capitalization of over $10 trillion are due to report earnings. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) will go on Wednesday, and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. The Fed is unlikely to surprise. The market has set about a 2% probability of a cut in the federal funds rate come July 30, according to CME FedWatch. Ed Yardeni and William Pesek of Yardeni Research believe rates will remain unchanged, they wrote Monday, though they expect Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-decision press conference to be "relatively dovish," raising the perceived odds of a September cut. (For now, they said, they're in the "none-and-done camp" for 2025.) S&P 500 companies on are track to report second-quarter year-over-year earnings growth of more than 6%, according to FactSet. The pressure is on the part of the Magnificent 7 posse reporting this week to surprise to the upside, either with their respective results or their outlooks, given how much weight they carry in the broad market index: Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia (NVDA) have accounted for almost half of the S&P 500's gain this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple has dragged. So far this reporting season, S&P 500 companies are showing "mixed results," per FactSet's John Butters. While the percentage of S&P companies surprising on the upside, 80%, is above five- and 10-year averages, the magnitude of those surprises remains below historical averages. "The capitulatory price action and EPS estimate cuts we saw in April of this year around Liberation Day represented the end of a rolling earnings recession that began in 2022," Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note published Monday. "Now, we appear to be transitioning to a rolling recovery backdrop," he said.

Title: Ethereum Is Becoming TradFi’s Settlement Layer — Here’s Why

Ethereum is quietly transforming from a hub of speculative activity into the foundational settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). With its secure infrastructure, growing regulatory alignment, and network effects, ETH is proving it can securely and efficiently handle large-scale institutional settlements. In an X post, crypto trader MoonKing recently highlighted a significant trend in the financial world, stating that Ethereum is becoming the settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). Since January, the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Ethereum have surged 20-fold, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down. The capital flows that were once confined to testnets and pilots are now moving decisively into production-level deployments on the ETH mainnet. This transition is supported by real yield and a growing regulatory traction, which together are driving greater institutional confidence. The leading institutions, like BlackRock, Plume, Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Franklin Templeton, are building with a clear intent to reshape financial infrastructure by leveraging blockchain. Their focus is not just on speculative crypto trading but on bringing US treasuries, credit products, and other yield-bearing assets directly into on-chain. This strategic movement signals a paradigm shift, as traditional finance is integrating with decentralized platforms to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. With ETF momentum building, stablecoin adoption is surging, and now a wave of real-world asset (RWA) inflows is accelerating, ETH is rapidly cementing its role as core financial infrastructure, which has become harder to ignore. This convergence of on-chain finance and legacy systems marks a critical inflection point where ETH is evolving into a foundational layer for global capital markets. BlackRock’s appetite for Ethereum keeps growing. According to Ucan_Coin revealed on X, the asset management giant has continued its accumulation through the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). BlackRock now holds 2.8 million ETH, worth around $10.5 billion. In the past week, BlackRock added another $440 million to its ETH holdings, which marks one of the largest single-week institutional inflows to date. ETH has experienced a brief pullback earlier in the week but has impressively reclaimed the $3,700 to $3,800 range, which has served as a key battleground for momentum over recent weeks. The altcoin market cap continues to hold firmly above the $1.25 trillion mark, a critical psychological and technical threshold that is reinforcing bullish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The institutional inflow led by giants like BlackRock has continued to fuel confidence, and the crypto market is gaining a firmer foothold in mainstream finance.

Title: Microsoft Stock Up More Than Amazon. Don’t Buy Into AI-Staff Cuts

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Companies touting AI-driven job cuts rarely see significant stock gains, with most performing only slightly better than the S&P 500.Only Microsoft has achieved market-beating returns by consistently exceeding expectations and leveraging AI for growth.True stock value comes from beating expectations and raising guidance, not just headcount reduction. Companies are bragging about their staff cuts even as they invest heavily in artificial intelligence, The Wall Street Journal reported. Only one company – Microsoft – could enjoy market-beating returns. A closer look at the eight companies highlighted – Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Loomis, Bank of America, Verizon, Amazon, Intel and Union Pacific – reveals an important insight for investors: On average, the companies have posted mediocre gains this year – up 9.3% compared to an 8.9% rise in the S&P 500 as of July 25, according to Google Finance. Here’s why you should think twice before investing in the shares of companies promoting their headcount reduction in the wake of AI deployments: Microsoft is the only one of the eight that beat and raised for the last four quarters. Since it is also getting growth from its AI investments, the company’s stock may be the only one of the eight likely to deliver above average investor returns. The average stock price increase of the companies touting their AI-driven job cuts is just slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s increase so far in 2025. Below are the companies along with their stock price change this year as of July 25 and what they have said about their job cuts: Job cut announcements rarely benefit investors. Moreover, such news tends to produce at most 2% stock price increases – if management convinces investors the layoffs are part of a broader AI strategy to enhance productivity. Even such modest bumps last one to three trading days, according to academic research such as Stock investors’ reaction to layoff announcements: A meta-analysis. Moreover, if the layoffs are seen as a reaction to weak demand or lack a clear efficiency narrative, returns are flat or negative, academic research suggests. So what makes investors better off? Stock prices tend to rise when companies beat investor expectations and raise their guidance. “Positive earnings surprises and upward guidance revisions typically lead to positive stock price reactions,” according to quantitative evidence from academic literature such as Warp Speed Price Moves: Jumps after Earnings Announcements. Microsoft has outperformed the other seven companies when it comes to beating revenue and earnings per share expectations and raising guidance ahead of investor views over the last four quarters. More specifically, Microsoft has surpassed investor revenue and EPS expectations in the most recent four quarters and provided positive guidance for the future – which in some cases exceeded consensus estimates. These results suggest Microsoft is monetizing its AI initiatives through growth in demand for its cloud services, according to the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call transcript. Amazon and Intel shares have fallen short of the S&P 500’s return over the last year. The shares of both companies took a beating because they did not consistently exceed investors’ revenue expectations and their guidance was disappointing. For instance, Amazon beat analysts’ EPS expectations each quarter but did not consistently exceed their revenue estimates. Moreover, investors have expressed concern over the e-commerce giant’s sometimes cautious guidance for future quarters, reported Yahoo! Finance. Intel suffered from slightly different problems. The chip giant consistently surpassed revenue estimates in the last four quarters but often missed EPS expectations and provided guidance for future quarters that often fallen short of investor expectations – indicating ongoing challenges in their turnaround strategy, noted Investing.com. Companies that tout their job cuts may repel top talent – which could slow their growth. So, consider investing in the ones that consistently beat expectations and raise guidance above consensus with help from AI investments that yield faster growth.

Title: What the techno-feudalism prophets get wrong
URL: https://mondediplo.com/2025/08/02techno-feudalism
Time Published: 2025-07-28T18:38:50Z
Full Content:
‘Cloudalists’ and digital serfs: capitalism’s new disguise? Capitalism isn’t dead, though many are rushing to write its obituary. It’s alive and kicking, powered by AI, vast data centres – and multi-billion dollar infrastructure investment. From Paris to Madrid, Rome to Berlin, a medieval spectre haunts the European left, and it’s wearing a Silicon Valley hoodie – ‘techno-feudalism’. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, de facto leader of French leftwing party La France Insoumise, has called for a tax on the profits of what he calls our new ‘digital lords’. Yet the same Mélenchon also tweets that ‘AI is not external to capitalist reality: it inscribes itself in a techno-feudalism where a few actors capture the rent.’ Profits or rent? Capitalism or feudalism? Like some stray Schrödinger’s Cat wandering the streets of Palo Alto, Mélenchon’s economy exists in two states simultaneously – dead and alive, capitalist and feudal, depending on which rhetorical convenience opens the box. In Spain, deputy prime minister Yolanda Díaz rails against ‘the techno-feudalism of magnate Elon Musk’, warning that tech billionaires want to transform ‘democracies into corporate monarchies’. Italy’s Green leader Angelo Bonelli accuses that same billionaire of erecting ‘an autocratic neo-feudalism’, urging the country to choose ‘Musk or democracy’. This outbreak of techno-feudal theatrics is hilariously mistimed, arriving in the middle of the most obscene, AI-fuelled capitalist orgy since the Gilded Age. During Trump’s Gulf tour in May 2025, he secured massive US-bound investments – Saudi Arabia committed $600bn, Qatar $1.2tn and the UAE $1.4tn, with much of it (if it ever materialises) earmarked for AI infrastructure. (This is on top of $1tn Japan promised back in February.) When OpenAI’s Sam Altman floated his $7tn fundraising fantasy last year, it felt like performance art. Now it looks more like a distinct lack of ambition. This AI spending tsunami has engulfed all of Big Tech: Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon alone are injecting $320bn into AI infrastructure in 2025, up from $246bn last year. Oracle signed $48bn in new contracts in a single quarter. (…) Evgeny Morozov (1) Paula Surridge, ‘Labour lost its leavers while Tory remainers stayed loyal’, The Guardian, London, 13 December 2019.

Title: Elon Musk is going founder mode on Tesla's $16.5 billion chip deal with Samsung

Time Published: 2025-07-28T17:26:29Z
Full Content:
Two particular lines in Elon Musk's posts about Tesla's new chip deal highlight just how far his "founder mode" approach extends. In this case, right down to his stated terms of Tesla's manufacturing agreement with Samsung. In a $16.5 billion deal, Samsung will produce Tesla's new AI6 chip from the manufacturing plant it is building in Taylor, Texas, which is expected to open in 2026. Located outside of Austin, Samsung's plant is close to where Musk moved in 2020, and where his company Tesla later moved in 2021. In an X post, Musk wrote that he would personally monitor the plant's activity. "This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress," Musk wrote. "And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house." In other words — "founder mode." Musk also wrote that Samsung "agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency." The Tesla CEO wrote that the deal, which Bloomberg first reported, was one of "strategic importance" for the automaker. Neither Tesla nor Samsung responded to a request for comment. Musk has long been known for taking a founder-mode approach to running his companies, an in-the-details entrepreneurial mindset that has flourished in Silicon Valley. He famously slept on the factory floor during Tesla's Model 3. He personally renamed and reorganized an entire company when taking over Twitter, now X, and he set up shop in D.C. during his DOGE era. The term "founder mode" itself, though, is newer. Its origins stem from a 2024 talk that Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky gave for the startup accelerator Y Combinator. In it, he advised against the common principle that leaders of large-scale companies should hire good employees and give them space to do their job. In a September essay titled "Founder Mode," YC cofounder Paul Graham reflected on Chesky's talk, writing that there are "things founders can do that managers can't." Graham coined the term "founder mode," describing leaders of big companies who work on the ground across the company, delving into the details at a granular level, and not just via their direct reports. Chesky later embraced the mantra named after his talk, along with much of Silicon Valley. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote on X that "we need founder mode companies in all industries." In his essay, Graham thanked a variety of tech leaders for reading early drafts, including YC CEO Garry Tan, venture capitalist Ron Conway, and Musk himself. While the terms Musk describes for Tesla's manufacturing deal and his plans to personally walk the Samsung assembly line are very "founder mode," he's not the only CEO keeping a close eye on a company's supply chain. Tim Cook rose through the ranks at Apple before becoming CEO by closely managing Apple's supply chain. The iPhone giant famously keeps a very close eye on its manufacturing partners, many of which are in China. A United airport sign photographed in 2019 and confirmed to be legitimate by the airline revealed that Apple was buying 50 business class seats a day for its employees to travel from San Francisco to Shanghai, a travel hub connecting to Zhengzhou and Shenzhen, which have been called "iPhone cities." The iPhone maker is also known for having a broad team of operations overseers. Samsung's new chip deal with Tesla marks a major win for its foundry business. As of 1 p.m. in New York, the company's stock price was up 6.8%. And while Tesla's assembly line workers have experienced Elon Musk's founder mode approach, it sounds like soon Samsung's will too.

Title: BlackRock CIO Warns US Must Issue ‘A Lot of Debt,’ Names One Factor That Could Trigger Stock Market Correction
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/28/blackrock-cio-warns-us-must-issue-a-lot-of-debt-names-one-factor-that-could-trigger-stock-market-correction/
Time Published: 2025-07-28T16:55:40Z

A top BlackRock insider says that the stock market could face a correction in the near future if inflation takes off. In a new interview on Bloomberg, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, says that the US government’s fiscal situation requires it to issue “a lot” more debt. Rieder says large debt issuance makes it harder to allow longer-term yields to go up, making it more difficult to invest in T-Bills with durations longer than 10 years. And if inflation picks up, Rieder says long bonds could get hit even harder along with equities. “We’re going to issue a lot of debt. The long end is a hard place to invest. It used to be that the long end protected you against the equity market. If inflation ends up being higher, which I don’t necessarily anticipate, then what’ll happen is equities and the long end will get hit. So the long end of the yield curve today, given that you can get so much yield – if you’re an investor on the front end – the long end doesn’t become that attractive.” Looking forward, Rieder says that the US can only maintain its debt burden if it somehow manages to spur a higher GDP than the amount of debt it takes on, perhaps with the productivity expected to come from the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). “There’s only one way to de-lever the economy. You’ve got to outrun the debt, you’ve got to outgrow it. So there is a plausible outcome where you get nominal GDP running at 4.5-5% if you get that interest rate down to 3%. Gosh, now you can start to de-lever but it takes a really long period of time. Listen, I think the one engine today, since we are going to have a bigger debt burden, and not only are we going to have a bigger debt burden, you have to fund it domestically, because internationalism doesn’t buy as much. As long as we grow, then you can work through it.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Trump's trade deals are set to unleash an 11% rally for stocks through year-end, Oppenheimer says

Call it a comeback. After markets went haywire in April, Trump's trade deals might have just saved the bull market, according to Oppenheimer's chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus. After lowering his year-end S&P 500 price target after the Liberation Day tariff announcements, Stoltzfus has reinstated his 7,100 target from December 2024, setting the stock market up for its third consecutive year of 20% gains. In the wake of President Donald Trump's EU and Japan trade deal, Stoltzfus believes the coast is clear for the S&P 500 to continue reaching all-time highs. "We believe that enough 'tariff hurdles' have been overcome for now to reinstate our original price target for the S&P 500 of 7100 by year-end," Stoltzfus wrote in a note on Monday morning. US exceptionalism in the stock market remains intact, Stoltzfus said. The EU trade deal Trump announced on Sunday sets tariffs of 15% on most European imports, half of the 30% Trump initially threatened. The EU has also agreed to purchase a "vast amount" of US military equipment and invest an additional $600 billion in the US. It's not just trade deals, though. US companies have held up financially through the volatility, and they're on track for a better-than-expected second quarter earnings season, Stoltzfus said. Out of the companies that have already reported second quarter earnings, 84% have beaten analyst estimates. Wall Street will be watching this week closely, as 164 companies — including the S&P 500's biggest names such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta —are set to report results. Helping the S&P 500's continued climb is the slow place of inflation. Price increases have remained relatively steady and inflation has drawn closer to the Fed's 2% target despite tariff volatility. "Monetary policy by the Fed has brought down the pace of inflation (if not yet to its 2% target level) without thus far causing a recession. This in our view is a substantial achievement considering inflation has gone from 9% in June of 2022 when the Fed recognized that inflation was out of hand to around 2.7% in June of this year," Stoltzfus wrote. Stoltzfus' 7,100 year-end price target implies a forward multiple of 25.8x and an earnings projection of $275. Investors should continue to bet on information technology, consumer discretionary, communications services, industrials, and financials, according to Stoltzfus. Jump to

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network An aerial view shows the Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, as U.S. President Donald Trump plans to regain control of the Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. said it may invite a “major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically-sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. “Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it “intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the consortium, Bloomberg News reported last week. Shares of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s firm oscillated between gains and losses after the announcement. The stock closed 0.84% lower in Hong Kong on Monday. Cosco Shipping Holdings Co., the listed unit of China Cosco, was down 2.9%. Monday’s confirmation about a Chinese investor will likely help remove the obstacles that have been holding back the deal. Beijing has so far viewed the sale of CK Hutchison’s 43 ports as a threat to its interests because it includes transfer of two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the group backed by BlackRock — which China considers a proxy for American influence. Chinese authorities separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. CK Hutchison reiterated its position Monday that it “will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities.” CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement on March 4, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. While it may initially sound like positive news, restricting the group to a few potentially strategic buyers means limited competition in the price discovery process for the asset, according to Ke Yan, head of research at DZT Research in Singapore. “Hence, the deal may not fetch the best price that the company hopes for,” he said. Investors have in recent weeks flocked back to CK Hutchison amid optimism that the 96-year-old Li will seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. It didn’t help that President Donald Trump billed the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Will AGI Take Nvidia Stock To $300?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Could Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) reach $300 in the next two years? There’s a strong possibility. How? Consider this, just about three months ago, at the end of April 2025, Nvidia stock was trading at around $95 levels and presently trades at close to $174 per share. The stock is also up roughly 4x over the past two years. Let’s look at valuations. Nvidia stock trades at about 40x consensus FY’26 earnings. Is this pricey?Not really. Especially if you consider the company's steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia's formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. And if AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) becomes even partially realized over the next few years, the demand for high-performance computing could soar exponentially. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia's revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $300 stock price. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las ... More Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) More Demanding Workloads, AGI Can Drive Revenue Nvidia's revenues grew by almost 2x over the last 12 months, while posting an average annual growth rate of about 69% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years - its revenues could move from around $131 billion in FY'25 to around $334 billion by FY'27 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Besides this, Nvidia recently indicated that it received assurances from the Trump administration allowing it to resume sales of its H20 artificial-intelligence chip to China after facing a ban around April. This marks a significant win for the company, as it preserves access to a major and fast-growing AI market. More importantly, AI is expected to evolve from its current form - writing text, generating images - to more general intelligence. While the timeline is not certain, the goal is to get AI to reason, plan, learn new tasks without retraining. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could conduct scientific research, generate novel insights, or design entire products on its own. This could unlock breakthroughs and innovations across industries and some models suggest this could push global GDP growth from low single digits to over 20% annually. ((The Economist)) As the world moves closer to AGI, Nvidia could stands to benefit enormously. AGI systems are expected to require massive computational resources to train and run, considerably exceeding today’s models, and Nvidia’s GPUs are currently the industry standard for powering such workloads. AGI could not just be the next industrial revolution, it could be much bigger and Nvidia’s chips could be right at the heart of it. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia Stock To Crash In 2025? Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. Net Margins Will Remain Thick Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia's margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY'19 to over 51% in FY'25 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia's launch of pricier higher-end products such as the latest Blackwell chips are offset by potentially higher costs and competition in the lower-end of the market from the likes of AMD. With margins remaining flat and revenue rising 2.5x, we could see earnings rise 2.5x. Looking for an alternative AI play: Could AI contender AMD see a lift ahead of earnings? Strong Results Could Mean Earnings Multiples Hold Up Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 16x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 40x now to about 16x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 28x looks quite likely. For perspective, Apple - a company that is growing at low single-digits - trades at 30x. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock by 1.7x within the next two years or so a real possibility, translating into a price of over $300 per share. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly. While Nvidia stock could have massive upside, it comes with risks and considerable volatility. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly. While Nvidia stock could have massive upside, it comes with risks and considerable volatility. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Turning the Software Factory into an Intelligence Engine

DevOps.com Turning the Software Factory into an Intelligence Engine By: Alan Shimel on July 28, 2025 We may have just witnessed the closing of one of the most iconic chapters in modern tech. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently stated that the company is transforming from a “software factory” into an “intelligence engine.” This came on the heels of another round of layoffs — with now over 7% of Microsoft’s workforce having been laid off recently — even as the company continues to report strong earnings. The implications of Nadella’s statement are far more profound than just a catchy metaphor for AI adoption. This may be the official end of the era Marc Andreessen launched when he declared “software is eating the world” and anointed every company a “software company.” Well, here we are. The world has been thoroughly chewed up and digested by software. Mission accomplished. Now what? We’re entering a new epoch — one where the core differentiator isn’t your software, it’s your intelligence. Not just artificial intelligence, but your organization’s ability to harness data, interpret it in real time, and act — autonomously, contextually and continuously. The software itself, once the crown jewel of digital transformation, is on the verge of being commoditized by the very intelligence it enabled. Why? Because increasingly, AI is writing the software. GitHub Copilot. Google Gemini Code Assist. Meta’s Code Llama. Even legacy enterprise players are integrating generative AI tooling to auto-generate workflows, scripts, tests and documentation. When AI can write, test, optimize and deploy software faster and better than a team of engineers, you start to ask: Is the code really the product, or is the intelligence behind it what actually matters? The answer is becoming clear. Software is no longer the endgame — it’s the delivery vehicle for intelligence. This transformation won’t just tweak job descriptions or shift a few budget lines. It’s going to shake corporate foundations like a 9.0 mega-quake. If your business model depends on proprietary code, you’re in trouble. If your engineering team is still grinding through feature requests by hand while your competitor has deployed autonomous agents to build, test and launch new capabilities in hours — game over. For large enterprises, the shift to intelligence engines means reorganizing around knowledge, not departments. Data pipelines will matter more than dev pipelines. Insight velocity will matter more than release velocity. The companies that succeed will be the ones that can build, refine, and deploy intelligence continuously — not just quarterly software updates. For SMBs, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. AI-enabled tools are leveling the playing field in a way we haven’t seen since the rise of cloud computing. A five-person startup can now compete with a Fortune 500 in terms of feature velocity, user experience and even customer support. Intelligence, not size, will be the ultimate force multiplier. And for the much-prophesied “one-person company” — yes, the age is dawning. With agentic AI handling coding, marketing, legal review, customer service and data analysis, a solopreneur can run a digitally native, globally available business without hiring a single employee. This isn’t just about flipping a switch or adding “AI” to your quarterly roadmap. Becoming an intelligence engine is a deliberate journey — and there are signs that mark the way: 1. Data-first mindset: Intelligence engines treat data as the core asset. They prioritize collecting high-quality, domain-specific data, and build the infrastructure to pipeline, label, refine and retrieve it for machine learning and decision automation. 2. Agentic workflows: Static automation is out. Dynamic, self-improving workflows powered by autonomous agents are in. These agents don’t just execute — they learn, adapt and optimize. 3. Continuous intelligence delivery: Think CI/CD, but for insights. Intelligence engines ship insights to decision-makers and operational systems on a real-time basis. 4. Synthetic workforce: Human labor is augmented—or even replaced—by synthetic workers: AI agents, copilots, bots and LLMs embedded into every facet of the business. 5. Organizational un-siloing: The intelligence engine operates horizontally across functions. Sales, marketing, ops and IT share a common data and intelligence backbone. Let’s be clear: software factories delivered immense value. But they were always limited by human throughput. Intelligence engines are unbounded by those constraints. An intelligence engine doesn’t just launch a product; it learns from the market response in real time and updates pricing, targeting, messaging, and UX on the fly. It doesn’t need a quarterly planning meeting to shift direction — it sees signals in the data and pivots autonomously. It doesn’t just automate workflows; it optimizes outcomes based on multidimensional, real-time feedback. The compounding advantage of this model is hard to overstate. Companies that reach intelligence engine status will move faster, serve smarter, and scale leaner than anything we’ve seen before. We’re already seeing the early adopters — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta — aligning their entire business models around intelligence-first infrastructure. But you don’t need hyperscaler resources to join the club. Thanks to open-source LLMs, accessible vector databases, and SaaS AI copilots, the tools are in reach for nearly everyone. The next 12–24 months will separate the true transformers from the late-stage digital dinosaurs. The tipping point will come when intelligence engines can fully replace not just manual workflows, but decision-making at scale. If you’re a technology leader, you need to ask yourself: Are we still building software factories when we should be engineering intelligence? This doesn’t mean gutting your dev team or replacing your engineers with bots overnight. But it does mean evolving your architecture, culture and processes to put intelligence — not just functionality — at the center of your strategy. At Techstrong, we’ll be watching this trend unfold across all our platforms — DevOps.com, Security Boulevard, Cloud Native Now, Platform Engineering,Digital CxO, and of course, Techstrong.ai. We’ll bring you the stories, strategies and signals of the companies making the leap from factory floor to intelligence engine. Software may have eaten the world — but intelligence is about to rewrite the recipe. Stay tuned.

Stock futures are pointing slightly higher after the U.S. and EU reach a trade deal; Samsung will produce AI chips for Tesla (TSLA) at a Texas facility in a $16.5 billion deal; Alibaba (BABA) unveils new AI glasses set to rival those from Meta Platforms (META); and Nike (NKE) shares are moving higher after JPMorgan upgrades the footwear maker's stock on momentum for global orders. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are moving higher as investors digest the latest trade deal between the U.S. and EU, which sent global stocks mostly higher. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are up 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, after the indexes ended last week at fresh all-time closing highs. Futures associated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average are 0.1% higher as the index hovers near its all-time high set last December. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is edging lower at just below $119,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is ticking higher. Oil futures are trading higher by more than 1%. Gold futures are little changed. The U.S. and the European Union reached a trade deal Sunday that will set a 15% tariff on goods from the 27-nation bloc, half the rate that was set to take effect Aug. 1. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal, which also includes an EU commitment to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion more in the country than current levels. The EU will not charge a tariff on U.S. goods. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced in a post on his X network that Samsung Electronics will produce artificial intelligence semiconductors for the automaker in a new Texas facility. Samsung had disclosed the deal to make the AI6 chip for a "large global company" was worth more than $16.5 billion. Musk said that Samsung is currently making the AI4 chip for Tesla, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) will make the AI5. Tesla shares are moving nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. Alibaba (BABA) unveiled a pair of AI-powered smart glasses as the Chinese e-commerce giants seeks to compete with the likes of Meta Platforms (META) in the wearable devices market. Alibaba's Quark AI Glasses "support hands-free calling, music streaming, real-time language translation, and meeting transcription," the company said. Meta announced it would release AI-powered glasses this summer with sunglasses maker Oakley. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba are 1.5% higher in premarket trading. Nike (NKE) shares are about 4% higher in premarket trading after JPMorgan analysts upgraded the footwear maker's stock to "overweight" on momentum in global orders. JPMorgan also raised its earnings per share estimates for Nike's fiscal 2026 and 2027 for the first time since downgrading the stock to "neutral" in June 2024. Late last month, Nike stock soared after it beat fiscal fourth-quarter estimates amid CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan to return to sales growth.

Title: Leading trainer Edward O’Grady dies aged 75

Time Published: 2025-07-28T11:53:47Z
Full Content:
Edward O’Grady, one of Ireland’s leading racehorse trainers over the last 50 years, has died aged 75. Based in Ballynotty, Co Tipperary, O’Grady trained his first Cheltenham Festival winner in 1974 and went on to enjoy 18 victories in all at National Hunt racing’s ultimate meeting. Most prominent among them was Golden Cygnet, a spectacular winner of the Supreme Novices Hurdle in 1978, who looked to have the racing world at his feet only to sustain fatal injuries in a fall just weeks later. O’Grady started training in 1972 and saddled his first winner, Vibrax, at Gowran Park in January of that year. He took over the license from his father Willie, who had just died. It meant O’Grady, who attended school at Blackrock College in Dublin, had to leave university without finishing a veterinary degree. He was in the spotlight due to the famous Gay Future controversy in 1974 when the horse of that name was at the centre of a gambling coup by an Irish betting syndicate. O’Grady was later played by Pierse Brosnan in the film ‘Murphy’s Stroke’ based on the matter. He was also instrumental in introducing the then bookmaker and gambler JP McManus to racehorse ownership. In 1982 the pair combined to win at Cheltenham with Mister Donovan. McManus backed the horse and later admitted: “He was needed!” O’Grady was champion National Hunt trainer in Ireland for four years between 1977 and 1980. He flirted with switching his attentions to the flat but returned to the jumps to some effect with star names such as Nick Dundee, Back In Front and Sound Man. A statement issued by his family through Horse Racing Ireland on Monday said: “It is with profound sadness that we announce the death of Edward O’Grady, who passed away peacefully yesterday evening at St James’s Hospital, surrounded by his family. “Edward was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and also one of the most respected and successful racehorse trainers of his generation. “Over the course of an extraordinary career that spanned more than five decades, Edward trained just shy of 1,700 winners under rules. His name became synonymous with Irish National Hunt racing, and he was a formidable force at Cheltenham and across the racing world. “Beyond the winners and the headlines, Edward was a man of deep intelligence, sharp wit, and remarkable warmth. He had friends on every continent, a story for every occasion, and a lifelong passion for the sport, the hunting field and everything equestrian.” O’Grady’s second wife, Maria, died in a fall while out hunting in 2017. He is survived by their daughters, Mimi and Rosie Mae, as well as his older children, Jonathan, Amber and Lucy.

Download the schedule (PDF) HOPE_16 Opening Ceremonies It all starts Friday morning. Join us as we make sure everything works before another HOPE is unleashed on everyone. Friday 1045 Marillac Auditorium Activism, Hactivism, and the Law Alex Muentz Protest has become more important and more dangerous in the U.S. It's harder to know where the line is between safe, lawful protest and actions that can get you sanctioned, arrested, or deported. Alex will discuss how to assess the risks you face in online and in-person protests, ranging from pickets to dropping docs. Friday 1600 Marillac Auditorium Aging Cyber Safely Laura Sang Hee Scherling, Josefina Piddo This presentation asks how we can better care for our older adults and improve cybersecurity awareness training and policies with their needs in mind. American adults over the age of 60 filed over 100,000 cybercrime-related complaints to the FBI in 2023 and experienced losses amounting to $3.2 billion. Older adults are the most vulnerable to cybercrime, and studies have found they feel ashamed to disclose having been victims. Although important initiatives exist, such as AllState's training sessions on cyber safety and AARP's free fraud helpline, there's a noticeable shortage in relevant resources. This research examines emerging cybersecurity awareness resources and policies supporting older adults, drawing from interviews with FINRA and the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). It also presents findings from the cybersecurity awareness initiative founded by the presenters: the Cyber Care Institute, recently introduced to four organizations and over 100 students in New York City. Saturday 1200 Little Theatre AI Is Undermining Our Privacy. What Can We Do About It? Robert Stribley We've been grappling with evolving issues around online privacy for years now, but the recent burst in use of AI or LLMs (large language models) has quickly introduced new and sometimes alarming privacy concerns for both users and those creating AI experiences to consider. This talk will take a look at six specific areas where AI is undermining privacy and discuss what, if anything, we can do about them. The six areas to be discussed are: lack of transparency with data sharing, accidental exposure of personal data, reversing data anonymization, deceptive design patterns, AI listening in everywhere, and malicious misuse of AI. To end on a constructive note, eight guidelines that designers and developers can follow to ensure they're focusing on privacy when working with AI will be discussed. Sunday 1700 Little Theatre Aphantasia: A Personal Reflection Dr. Earl Brown Imagine a mind without mental images, where "picture this" has no meaning. Aphantasia - the inability to form mental images - is a little-known, rare condition that affects around one to four percent of the population. In this presentation, Earl will talk about aphantasia and how it has impacted his professional life as a pathologist and a teacher with more than 35 years of experience. He will explore its impact - both good and bad - on everyday experiences such as chess, piano, drawing, reading, memory, and learning, finally speculating on how aphantasia may affect creativity and the hacker mindset. Friday 1800 Tobin 201/202 The ARTS Open Framework Sabar Dasgupta Over the past several decades, the scientific process has relied more and more on computational analysis of data to produce digital artifacts. Fields like molecular biology, neuroscience, linguistics, and astrophysics, to name a few, have been revolutionized by this trend to the point that computational workflows are ubiquitous. Although most of these workflows are very similar at a high level - collecting data, analyzing it with code, and publishing the resulting figures - implementation details differ widely. While there exist standards such as the FAIR Guiding Principles for organizing and sharing data, there are not widely adopted standards for reliably regenerating analyses from said data, especially across compute environments. This talk presents an open framework for archived, reproducible, and transparent science (ARTS) that aims to do exactly this - by packaging data, code, and figures in containers and uploading it to a persistent, trusted, and accessible archive. Sunday 1500 Little Theatre Ask the EFF William Budington, Lena Cohen, Cara Gagliano, JosÃ© Martinez This year, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will be returning to HOPE for a special "Ask the EFF" panel to address some of the pressing questions the hacker community has in these troubled times. Panelists will provide updates on current EFF work, including the ongoing case against the "Department" of Government Oversight, educating the public on their digital rights, organizing communities to resist ongoing government surveillance, and more. The panel will then turn it over to attendees to pose questions and receive insights on how users can protect their civil liberties online during an increasingly volatile political and world situation. Saturday 1200 Marillac Auditorium (2 hours!) ATM Hacking: Past and Present Roman Pushkin This talk explores the evolution of ATM hacking, from classic physical attacks to modern software exploits, using two real-world case studies. Roman will demonstrate how cybercriminals bypass security measures and why banks often stay silent. Attendees will see a live demo of a custom "flusher device" built for a tabletop coin dispenser (reverse-engineered from eBay), highlighting vulnerabilities in cash-handling systems. Sunday 1300 Tobin 201/202 Back to Basics: Building Resilient Cyber Defenses for Multiple Use Cases Yael Grauer In spite of novel cybersecurity threats, digital security advice has remained largely unchanged in recent years. In fact, a lot of advice in response to high-profile attacks doesn't actually address risks people are most likely to face. This talk will analyze several high-profile digital security concerns, whether viral advice to address it would have been effective, and what steps could be taken - both before and after the issue arises. You will hear of lessons learned from years of auditing and updating Security Planner, a digital security guide that provides customized plans based on responses to a few survey questions. The presentation will further delve into ways to segment digital security advice so that it's personalized to the individual, their devices, their technical capabilities, and the type of risks they're likely to face. Saturday 1600 Little Theatre Bitcoin Poker: Satoshi's Lost Game and Its Decentralized Revival Mattias Bergstrom Bitcoin v0.1.5, the last version personally coded by Satoshi Nakamoto, contains curious references to poker buried in its source code. While never officially documented, these fragments suggest that Bitcoin's original design may have envisioned more than just money; it may have included decentralized, trustless gaming. This talk will explore the historical and technical significance of these lost poker references, analyzing: What was Satoshi's intent? Was this an abandoned feature, an experiment, or an overlooked function of Bitcoin's game-theoretic design? How was poker referenced in early Bitcoin? There will be a deep dive into the code archaeology of v0.1.5 and why poker may have been included. The presentation will also include the introduction of Bitcoin Poker, a modern Rust-based reimagining of trustless, peer-to-peer poker, demonstrating how we can host fully decentralized poker games without a centralized server, use multi-signature escrows for provably fair betting and payouts, ensure post-quantum security for long-term cryptographic safety, and implement a sidechain execution model to handle high-frequency transactions without bloating the main chain. Sunday 1200 Little Theatre Bitpart: 5-In-1 Platform for Activism Over Signal Josh King Signal is one of the most critical tools we have for secure communication amongst activists, journalists, and human rights defenders. As of 2024, Signal has over 70 million active users and over 220 million downloads, with no signs of slowing down. With the global rise of the far-right and corresponding attacks on human rights, the ability to securely organize via Signal against these forces is more important than ever. To that end, Throneless Tech has embarked on an in-depth research project that resulted in the creation of Bitpart: a Rust-based software platform that allows for the creation of dynamic organizing tools on top of Signal. Depending on the end-users' tech capacity, Bitpart can be run on organizers' own self-hosted servers or through Throneless-hosted servers. The project builds on experience gained from past Signal chatbot projects, and new research conducted with targeted groups such as current organizers, activists, and journalists around the world. In this session Josh King, developer of Bitpart, will demonstrate how the platform is being used to create bots that activists can use as secure, anonymous tiplines, digital helpdesks, broadcast lists, a tool to distribute eSIMs, and a tool to share VPN download codes. Participants will come away with an understanding of how Signal can be utilized in novel ways, how to think through the threat model and risk assessment for creating secure tools for activists, and how Bitpart can be expanded upon and applied to their own communities. Friday 2000 Little Theatre Both Sides of the Wire: Surveillance, Whistleblowing, and Building a Cyber Peace Movement John Kiriakou As a former CIA officer who exposed the agency's torture program, John Kiriakou paid the price with his freedom. In addition to disclosing wrongdoing, he understands surveillance from the inside. This talk brings together that firsthand knowledge with a challenge to the hacker community: we must pursue a cybersecurity model rooted in cooperation, transparency, and peace rather than conflict. This talk will explain how today's digital ecosystems - including both software and hardware - are vulnerable not only to technical compromise but also to political manipulation. The threats we face are not just from malicious actors or hostile governments, but from within our own systems. Co-opted code, opaque procurement processes, and surveillance-by-design continue to erode public trust. It is time to reclaim the hacker ethos and direct it toward a global cyber peace movement. Here you will learn why hackers, technologists, and civil society must lead this effort, and how the only sustainable security is one built collaboratively, with integrity and purpose. Saturday 1600 Marillac Auditorium Bridging the Decentralized Gap: Shared Hacker Values, Cypherpunk Roots, and the Future of Blockchains Alexander Urbelis, Phil Daian, Harry Halpin This panel will delve into the deep-rooted connections between hacker and cypherpunk culture and the evolution of Ethereum and blockchain technology, tracing their shared emphasis on decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles. By revisiting the historical context of the 1990s Crypto Wars and projects like PGP and Tor, the discussion will highlight how these early movements laid the groundwork for the vision of a trustless, user-sovereign Internet. The panel also will aim to debunk common misconceptions that associate blockchains solely with scams or speculation, showcasing real-world applications such as the Ethereum Name Service and privacy-preserving technologies, while emphasizing the ecosystem's pivot towards public goods and accessibility. Ultimately, the conversation will underscore the enduring, collaborative vision of both hacker and blockchain communities - advancing censorship resistance, user empowerment, financial privacy, and a decentralized digital future. Saturday 2000 Little Theatre Build a Tech Community in Your Neighborhood, One Hackathon at a Time William Hutson This talk chronicles the journey of creating a vibrant tech community through short, accessible two-hour mini-hackathons that lower barriers to participation. The speaker shares their experience of building Flushing Tech's successful bi-weekly hackathon program, and provides a practical roadmap for you to try this at home in your own neighborhood. Leave with actionable guidelines for starting similar initiatives that emphasize the importance of creating an inclusive environment that welcomes participants of all skill levels while maintaining enough technical focus to drive meaningful project development. This talk is ideal for community organizers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone interested in fostering grassroots innovation in their local area. Saturday 1100 Tobin 201/202 Bureaucracy Hacking - Creating Organizational Exploit Chains for Good Adam L. Hesch At their core, all bureaucracies are, fundamentally, information systems, containing the ability to store information, compute information, and share information over a network. This means they all can be hacked. In this funny, enriching, and ultimately inspirational talk, the concept of "bureaucracy hacking" will be discussed as a way to make a difference in any organization of any size, even (perhaps most especially) when you feel like "just a cog in the machine." The talk will be suitable for a novice audience of any background, with high level references to traditional information security, hacking, and of course social engineering principles. What will make it unique and interesting will be particular emphasis on the exploitation of the emergent and unique properties of bureaucracies. It will be most actionable by young, idealistic entrants into the workforce. And, it may yet inspire the younger versions of ourselves inside each of us that our (warranted) cynicism has led us to ignore or forget (at our peril). Stories will come from the speaker's (and others') experiences at organizations like Meta, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Navy, and others. It is intended as a rebuttal to, and toolkit for, countering "Pournelle's iron law of bureaucracy." Sunday 1000 Marillac Auditorium Claw Back Your Data From Big Tech With Cyd Micah Lee, redshiftzero Tech platforms can't be trusted. Oligarchs and billionaires want you to keep giving your data to their Big Tech companies for free so they can sell it and manipulate you into believing nonsense. In this talk, the Lockdown Systems collective will introduce Cyd, their open source desktop app that makes it easy for people to reclaim control over their data from Big Tech. Giving users actual control over their data is challenging when dealing with hostile, enshittified tech platforms like X and Facebook. Cyd bypasses all of that though by putting the user in the driver's seat: it runs on the user's own computer, from their own IP address, and it works by automating a web browser on their behalf - and sometimes relying on APIs, when they're available, free, and don't suck. It doesn't share any access to your accounts or your data with the Lockdown Systems collective. Attendees will learn how Cyd works under the hood, how you can use it, and how you can contribute to building tools that challenge the dominance of Big Tech. Friday 1700 Marillac Auditorium Communication and Movement in Internet Shutdown Protests: Rethinking Mesh Messaging Cora Rowena Ruiz 2024 was the worst year for Internet shutdowns ever recorded, with nearly 296 documented events across 54 countries. Frequently imposed during protests and times of unrest, shutdowns are commonly used as a tactic to suppress dissent and restrict communication. Mesh messaging is widely hailed as a potential workaround, yet these tools are generally considered unreliable, untrusted, and ultimately go unused. Mesh systems depend heavily on the spatial relationships between nodes, but existing research on how people move and communicate in protest settings is sparse. This talk explores a holistic approach to mesh tool design, grounded in qualitative firsthand experiences to build effective blackout-resistant mesh tools. Saturday 2000 Tobin 201/202 Computational Techniques for Making Karaoke Harder Jamie Brew Robot Karaoke is a live comedy show that swaps lyrics with fragments of text drawn from a catalog of esoteric datasets (quora questions, web banner ads, tax forms, and more) to create and sing never-before-sung karaoke songs. This talk covers how the data is sourced, how the songs are phonetically annotated, and how the show is run and the core software (the Weird Algorithm) developed. The presentation will end with a demo of the future of karaoke. Saturday 2100 Little Theatre The Computer Underground Scene - Past, Present, and Future Netspooky (Phrack / HCC), TMZ ( Phrack / tmp.Out), Skyper (THC / ex-Phrack), John Threat (Masters of Deception), Bill Budington (Electronic Frontier Foundation) This is a brainstorming session together with the audience. The panel will talk and unravel a bit about the past and present, and try to find a shared vision of where we are or should be heading. Sunday 1300 Marillac Auditorium (2 hours!) Counter-Surveillance as Activism: Using Cameras Against State Violence in Israel/Palestine Aman Abhishek Palestinian, Israeli, and international anti-occupation activists in Israel/Palestine have been using cameras to deter and document violence from Israeli security forces and settlers for around two decades. Human rights organizations first started distributing cameras in the mid-2000s to facilitate documentation, and today, essentially every anti-occupation activist in the West Bank and Jerusalem carries some combination of video cameras, smartphones, and body cameras to deter and document state-settler violence. The activists also take it upon themselves to take the videos to journalists, human rights organizations, courts, and elsewhere; recently, this activism was the focus of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land. This talk will describe how activists organize, what happens to the footage, how this activism changed after October 7th, and what this all means for thinking about counter-surveillance as a strategic response to state violence. Sunday 1200 Marillac Auditorium Cracking Enigma: A Chronology of Cryptographic Breakthroughs Brais Macknik-Conde The Enigma machine was a sophisticated encryption device used by Nazi Germany during World War II. Its mechanical design utilized three rotors that scrambled plaintext into complex ciphertext, with additional layers of security from unique internal settings. However, inherent weaknesses and poor operational procedures left it vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The first successful attacks on Enigma were conducted by Polish mathematicians in the early 1930s. By exploiting repeating message indicators and rotor cycle patterns, they deduced rotor wirings and constructed replica Enigma machines. Their breakthroughs enabled systematic decryption until German countermeasures in 1938 forced new approaches. Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park refined these methods, pioneering statistical techniques and mechanical computation to accelerate decryption. Techniques such as Banburismus and the Good-Turing estimation method were created under Turing's leadership. The development of the Bombe machine allowed rapid elimination of incorrect rotor settings, enabling the Allies to decipher vast amounts of enemy communication. This presentation will focus on history and cryptography, examining how breaking Enigma provided critical intelligence that shaped Allied strategies and shortened the war by an estimated two years, saving millions of lives in one of humankind's most significant intelligence operations. Saturday 1800 Tobin 201/202 CRXaminer - Deep Dive Into Chrome Extensions (Plus Tool) Mark El-Khoury You spend your time configuring HTTP headers and hardening your containers. Meanwhile your CFO just downloaded a Chrome extension to make the font in Gmail Comic Sans. What are Chrome extensions, exactly? This talk will dive into details, including format, contents, static analysis with custom rules, threat modeling (when does this even matter?), and some of the unique challenges of building a security scanner. A tool will be demoed that has just been released for this: CRXaminer (crxaminer.tech). You will learn how you can immediately start using it. Friday 1400 Tobin 201/202 Dark Web Digger: Modular Scraping for Dark Web Intel Samantha Stortz, Dominick Foti Dark web forums are a major resource for the hacking community and play a large role in the spread of information, data leaks, tools, services, and related transactions. While it is common for users to keep similar usernames and identifiers across different forums to maintain their credibility, these users often need to create or change accounts. The prototype presented here looks to tie anonymized accounts to the same user, as they will likely have similar language usage, post content, tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs). The presenters developed a modular web scraper that can extract data from forums and store said data for analysis. They explore opportunities to leverage machine learning techniques to automate and enhance the process of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysis in the future. This includes using natural language processing (NLP) to digitally fingerprint users based on speech patterns, trend detection between users and forums, and even a chatbot to assist the tool's users in finding specific information. The project provides analysts with a wholistic view of how users interact on these forums, making it more functional and versatile. Friday 1100 Marillac Auditorium Data Autonomy: Counter-Surveillance Strategies for Civil Society Marlon Kautz The surveillance apparatus in the West is going critical, and civil society is not prepared for the fallout. Political leadership is explicitly targeting NGOs and social movements using surveillance capabilities that have been perfected over the past decade. This talk will evaluate the merits and limitations of different counter-surveillance approaches from the vantage point of grassroots organizers, and go beyond the stock advice of "use Signal and a VPN" to offer proposals for defeating state surveillance through technical infrastructure development and political organizing. Friday 2100 Little Theatre Design for Neurodiversity: Creating Neuro-Inclusive Spaces Dorothy Howard This talk will explore the concept of neurodiversity and its implications for designing events and spaces with neurodivergent people's diverse needs in mind. The neurodiversity paradigm promotes embracing neurological differences, emerging from the autistic rights and disability justice movements of the 1990s. Accessibility guides and resources rarely focus on neuro-inclusive design. The presentation will highlight strategies for creating neuro-inclusive environments informed by research in education, including examples such as low-sensory rooms in libraries and conferences. Attendees will be encouraged to reflect on how neuro-inclusive design can benefit the communities they engage with. Saturday 1400 Tobin 201/202 DIY Police Scanner With SDRs and Open Source Software nop Police accountability requires transparency, but access to relevant information is frequently hindered by collaborators in government or the police themselves. Fortunately there is one source of info we can take into our own hands: their radios. Police in the United States largely use the digital, trunked radio system "Project 25." We can listen in to this using spare computers, a few Software Defined Radios (SDRs), and open source software. Even better, we can go far beyond what very simple broadcastify-style dispatch streams offer, like having our own archives of radio traffic. Based on an actual system that sees real-world use, this talk will cover how to set up your very own DIY police scanner. Ansible playbooks and supporting scripts to streamline the process will be released, and practical tips and lessons for real-world applications of such a system will be covered. Saturday 1900 Marillac Auditorium Eco-Hacking Desire: The Intersection of Pornography, Sex, and Environmental Impact Jasmin Hagendorfer This talk explores the intersection of desire and sustainability, examining how even our most intimate moments leave an environmental footprint. The concept of sexecology, coined by Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, bridges environmentalism and sexuality in creative ways. From solar-powered vibrators to eco-friendly sex toys, the session delves into the often overlooked world of green sex tech and eco-erotic practices. Key questions explored will include: What are the true environmental costs of online pornography? How sustainable is our streaming culture and AI technologies? Can DIY pleasure practices be a form of political activism? What role does ethical pornography play in envisioning a better future? The discussion will also cover energy consumption, server loads, and the hidden costs behind virtual acts of desire. The focus is not to shame desire, but to empower it with awareness, curiosity, and hacker ethics. The speaker, a feminist activist and artist, aims to foster a dialogue about how digital intimacy can become more visible, accountable, and hackable. This talk invites the hacker community and beyond to collaborate in rethinking the infrastructures behind online pleasure and to explore ways of making the environmental impact of these systems more transparent. Friday 1900 Little Theatre Esolangs as a Hacker Folk Art Daniel Temkin The most important computational art is happening far from museums, immersive art "experiences," and the smoldering ruins of NFT platforms. Esolangs, like demos and code golf, are hacker folk art, born entirely outside the art world, yet beginning to get wider attention as more digital artists and poets contribute to the form. This should not be a surprise with the critical work it has done to explore our relationship with technology, the politics of computing, the aesthetics of code, among many other subjects. This talk will present esolangs, not as a loose collection of language associated by algorithmic complexity, but a social history of how each language influenced the next, drawing from ten years of interviews for the blog esoteric.codes. It will look at esolangs as more than technical wizardry and consider aesthetics for this form that often pretends to eschew aesthetics entirely. Friday 2000 Tobin 201/202 Expanding the BioArtBot Color Palette - A Beginner's guide to Lab Automation and Biosafety Danny Chan bioartbot.org/ is a project for encouraging curiosity in microbiology and lab automation through creative expression. It is an open source project built on a pipetting robot that draws user submitted pixel art by placing colored bacteria on agar. Using the story of the BioArtBot development as a guide, this talk will provide a basic overview of the technologies (hardware, software, and wetware) implemented in the BioArtBot. It will describe how lab automation is used in biotech companies, how it might be used by amateur/community investigators, and how the BioArtBot is an interesting framework to contribute to if you are looking to skill-up in lab automation. It will also describe how the living pigments for this project were created and sourced, how you might create/source your own, and the amazing diversity of living chemical refineries that are bacteria. So if you're interested in robots and bacteria, come find out how we can command our tireless inorganic creations to deposit aesthetically pleasing arrangements of the ancient form-factor of all life. Saturday 2100 Tobin 201/202 Exploiting Emergent Property-Based Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models David Kuszmar As AI technology expands across both benign and malicious applications, our understanding of the attack surface must evolve to account for emergent properties in complex systems. In large language models, these emergent behaviors create novel classes of vulnerabilities that are not only unpatched, but largely unrecognized. By systematically manipulating the model's limited perception of reality, attackers can induce cascading failures that go far beyond traditional filter bypasses, exposing fundamental weaknesses in the internal logic and contextual binding of these systems. This session will unpack how these vulnerabilities work, walk through real examples, and explore the far-reaching implications for AI security, governance, and safety. Sunday 1400 Tobin 201/202 The Five Pillars for Rewriting History and Culture Alexander J. Urbelis, Daniel Nowak, Roel Schouwenberg From printing press to blockchain, technological advances reshape historical narratives across five pillars: finance, governance, faith, communications, and consciousness. Influential entities employ sophisticated cyber and information solutions to manipulate resources and power. Governments, corporations, and NGOs manage narratives, shaping opinion and obscuring truths as they manage perception. Religious groups use digital platforms to spread doctrine, blurring traditional faith boundaries. Social media and emerging technologies amplify disinformation worldwide. These operations exploit cognitive vulnerabilities, reshaping collective memory and fueling evolving consciousness. This talk will examine how technology-driven psychological operations can unmake historical canons, normalizing new realities and marginalizing dissent. The presenters will highlight ethical dilemmas and stress the urgent need for transparency, critical awareness, and decentralization across all pillars. Lastly, they will offer recommendations for how the individual can remain resilient in the face of these existential threats and multifaceted Manichean devils. Friday 1200 Marillac Auditorium The Free Software Movement: Where It Came From, What It Means to Me, and What It Could Mean to You Craig Topham This talk is the journey of Craig's discovery of the free software movement and how it solved his need to find a position in the fight for a better tomorrow. The hope is to inspire others to share this viewpoint of free software and to see how it is a critical factor for civilization if we want to avoid the nightmare dystopia which awaits us all if the free software movement fails. Saturday 1600 Tobin 201/202 From Activism to Hacktivism: Resisting Digital Repression Gabrielle Joni Verreault, Elina Castillo-Jimnez, Jane Eklund, Ken Mayers (Moderator) This panel discussion will offer insights into the challenges faced by human rights defenders and hacktivists in today's context of intensified digital repression, including surveillance, censorship, and cyberwarfare. The three panelists will report from the frontlines, sharing their technical expertise and experiences living among activists and supporting them in their work in different countries. Topics will include hacktivism in Ukraine, disrupting surveillance in Serbia and Thailand, and tech and reproductive rights in the USA and worldwide. Each panelist will briefly share their stories and insights, and then the discussion between them and the audience will be opened. Saturday 2100 Marillac Auditorium The Future of Email Is Open Dejan Å trbac, William Lessard Email is one of our most essential tools, yet it's controlled by a handful of corporations that scan, monetize, and gate-keep our communication. In this talk, the presenters will introduce OpenEmail, a ground-up re-imagining of async communication built on a radically simple, open protocol. Designed for privacy, integrity, and interoperability, OpenEmail combines end-to-end encryption; decentralized delivery; and a public, extensible architecture to give users true ownership of their communication, and developers the freedom to build on top of an open social protocol. They will explore how a spam-free, surveillance-free inbox, where messages are trustworthy by design, can reclaim the Internet as a space for open, human connection, free from Big Tech. More than just a talk, this is a call to arms: to take back control of our communication and build a digital future that serves people, not profit. Saturday 1900 Little Theatre Getting Out of DOGE: A Discussion With a Former DOGE Engineer Adam Klasfeld, Sahil Lavingia The whole world has been watching as the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE), the partnership between Elon Musk and the Trump administration, has worked to fulfill its pledge to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. Despite promises to the contrary, there has been very little transparency about DOGE or its operations - until now. Join Adam Klasfeld, a former MSNBC legal contributor and founder of All Rise News, as he interviews Sahil Lavingia, a former DOGE engineer. This discussion aims to reveal what DOGE is really doing behind the scenes and offer the public a unique chance to ask direct questions to someone who was there. Friday 1400 Marillac Auditorium Hackers Got Talent Jason Scott & Friends It just wouldn't be HOPE without another installment of "Hackers Got Talent." This is an opportunity for hackers from all around the planet to show off their talents in this cheeky display of hacker (and totally non-hacker) skills. Just sign up at InfoDesk and the talent you decide to share is entirely up to you. (Seriously, anything you're good at is a talent.) Hacker archivist Jason Scott will again be on hand to keep everything moving. Judging will be done by a combination of panelists and audience members. First place wins a valuable prize! Second place... we'll see. Saturday 2200 Marillac Auditorium (2 hours!) Hacking for Social Justice Danacea Vo "How can my hacking skills become a force for advancing social justice?" Those who ponder this question often know what they're up against - oppression, inequality, enshitification.... But the path toward building meaningful change can feel unclear or overwhelming. This talk draws from years of experience working alongside activists, human rights defenders, and digital organizers, and offers a practical framework for lasting, meaningful change. You'll gain social impact strategies that will help you align your technical skills with the movements and communities you care about. If you've ever felt the call to do more - with purpose, with clarity, with community - this is your invitation. Saturday 1900 Tobin 201/202 Hacking Search: Kagi's Revolt Against the Ad-Tech Machine Vladimir Prelovac You know the drill: search for official travel info, get an overcharging third-party site. Look for a hotel, get a misleading aggregator. "Free" search costs you time, money, and trust. Kagi is the revolt - a paid, obsessively user-centric search engine architected to serve you, not the advertisers. This session reveals how Kagi sidesteps the surveillance model, leveraging diverse sources and AI tools (under your control) to deliver clean, customizable results. Founder Vlad Prelovac will detail the tech choices enabling genuine user agency (blocking SEO garbage, elevating trusted sources via filters), the challenge of building viable alternatives outside the ad-tech ecosystem, and the fight to restore user agency against data-hoarding monopolies. If you're tired of being the product on the web, join the resistance. Saturday 1300 Little Theatre Hacking the Future at Tesla Science Center Michael Caprio, Jeffrey Velez, Ed Wilson The year 2026 marks the 170th birthday of Nikola Tesla and will also be the year that the grounds of his Wardenclyffe laboratory will at last open to the public. Learn about the latest goings-on from Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe detailing their visitor center renovation and opening; development of their amateur radio station and radio club; expansion of their public and educational programming with space science courses, events, and hackathons; a future hackerspace; and more exciting projects! Sunday 1100 Marillac Auditorium Hacking the Tech-Industrial Complex: Learning to See Invisible Systems Seth Godin The author of more than 20 international bestsellers gives us an inside view of the systems that drive our culture. Every dominant system works to maintain itself, and we can find strategies and stories that push to make things better. Saturday 1100 Marillac Auditorium Hack the Violin Part 2: The Advanced Stuff - This Time There's AI Andrew Morican, Ebmbat This is a follow-on from "Hack the Violin: A Hacker's Approach to Learning, Playing, and Teaching the Violin" from Hope XV. This will be a look at technology, most notably AI and hacking the violin. You will learn what's out there and what the presenters were able to achieve with their own AI project regarding practicing and engagement. You will also learn about AI with live performance and creation, as well as AI and string sampling - and see how sampling may be altering the stringscape. Friday 1300 Little Theatre Hardware Hacking Meets Art: How Movie Special Effects Are Made Davis DeWitt Step into the world of movie magic with Davis DeWitt, a filmmaker, inventor, and former Mythbuster and learn how combining hardware hacking with art creates objects that do more than function: they evoke emotion and tell stories. From blowing up cars to building robots with personality, this talk will explore why it's important to tackle projects that blur the lines between disciplines. Friday 1900 Marillac Auditorium HOPE_16 Badge - No Badge, No Problem Victoria Joh, Vinicius Fortuna Electronic badges have become a focal point of hacking conferences and key to growing the immersive conference experience! This talk will provide a brief history of electronic conference badges, as well as discuss the good, the badge, and the ugly from the speakers' attempt at a new and improved production run this year. Sadly, while there will not be a new production of the improved HOPE badge in time for the con to be shared with HOPE_16 attendees, this will still be a lively discussion of everyone's favorite badges from past hacking conferences. The design and production challenges that inevitably cropped up will be discussed in detail. The struggle to produce a working badge aligning both funding and functionality is real. This year has been no exception, with various uncertainties such as tariffs and geopolitical norms at play. Despite the challenges, many lessons have been learned. This is an opportunity to plan for a future run, share experiences with others, and get more interested individuals to join the team and get involved. Saturday 1400 Little Theatre How a Handful of Location Data Brokers Actively Track Millions, and How to Stop Them Bill Budington, Lena Cohen In the past year, a number of investigations have revealed the outsized role of a few select companies in gathering, storing, and selling the location data of millions of devices - and by extension people - worldwide. These companies largely use technologies which power the online advertising industry in order to collect and disseminate this data. To make matters worse, this data has been both provided to private investigators on the mere assurance that they plan to work with law enforcement, and has been subject to data breaches which put the privacy of millions at risk. This talk will elaborate on the technologies, data flows, and industry players which comprise this complicated ecosystem. Most importantly, it will cover some basic steps you can perform to protect yourself against the wide array of location privacy harms your device subjects you to. The presenters will show tools and techniques they've developed to allow users to take back ownership of our devices, rather than our devices owning us. Friday 1500 Marillac Auditorium How I Used and Abused LLMs to Get Top 250 on HTB Rambo Anderson-You This talk explores an experiment in giving AI system-wide access to compete on Hack The Box (HTB). The talk details the development of a semiautonomous workflow for capture the flag (CTF) competitions, involving jailbreaks, LLM switching, and hardware. Through iterative diagrams, the talk traces how the workflow evolved as the AI improved at capturing flags. This presentation considers how this CTF solving AI slop might extend to real world scenarios like penetration testing, red teaming, and bug bounty hunting. Sunday 1500 Tobin 201/202 How Law Enforcement Agencies Compromise Entire Encrypted Chat Platforms Joseph Cox Law enforcement agencies compromising entire encrypted communication platforms to read peoples' messages is no longer an outlier. It is the new normal. That includes the FBI taking a tech startup called Anom and inserting its own backdoor, French authorities pushing a malicious update to tens of thousands of EncroChat devices, European cops hacking another company called Sky, or any of the increasing number of related cases. In this talk, Joseph Cox, co-founder of 404 Media and author of Dark Wire will detail police tactics, pulling from his nearly ten years of covering the encrypted phone industry. Saturday 1400 Marillac Auditorium How to Be Positively Transgressive: Hacking Culture for Good Johannes Grenzfurthner (monochrom) In an era where transgression has been co-opted by reactionary forces, how can we reclaim subversion as a tool for positive change? Historically, countercultures, hackers, and artists have used disruption to challenge power structures, expose hypocrisy, and expand the boundaries of what is possible. Yet today, the same methods - culture jamming, media pranks, and ideological infiltration - are increasingly wielded by ultra-right movements to erode democratic values and spread reactionary narratives. This talk will explore how we can re-hack the hacker mindset: How can we use transgressivity in ways that are constructive rather than destructive? How do we subvert without merely burning things down? Can we retool the aesthetics and tactics of countercultural rebellion to push society forward instead of backward? Through historical examples, personal experiences, and a healthy dose of mischievous strategy, this talk will try to outline actionable ways to engage in cultural hacking that disrupt oppressive systems while reinforcing community, inclusivity, and progressive values. Because giving up on the tools of subversion means surrendering the battlefield. And that, phreaky phriends, is not an option. Sunday 1500 Marillac Auditorium Human Augmentation: Hacking Human Perception and Performance With Technology: Benefits and Dangers Lucas Potter, Xavier Palmer, Vivekanand Pandey Vimal Human augmentation is the idea of using technology to hack, alter, and enhance human perception and performance. Imagine being able to enhance your ability to navigate by sensing the flow of magnetic fields like a pigeon. Many industries are starting to explore human augmentation, such as space (enhancing astronauts), medical (rehabilitation), entertainment (greater immersion), military (greater performance), among others. In the first presentation, Dr. Vimal will begin by providing an overview of psychology and neuroscience research on the topics of human augmentation. Then he will share his own NASA-funded research on using sensory augmentation as a countermeasure for spatial disorientation. What dangers could arise from building a bridge between human and sensory augmentation devices that have the capability of altering human perception? This question will connect to the second presentation of the panel, where Dr. Palmer and Dr. Potter will explore how human augmentation connects to security through biocybersecurity followed by Q&A. Friday 1600 Little Theatre ICEBlock and the Age of Digital Activism Joshua Aaron Learn how ICEBlock has empowered over a million users nationwide to report immigration and customs enforcement activities anonymously, despite government pushback. Discover how you can use your tech skills to drive change and advocate for causes you believe in. Plus, stick around for a Q&A session where you can interact directly with the creator! This talk will be remote due to the targeting of the speaker by the current administration. Sunday 1600 Marillac Auditorium (2 hours!) Into the Fediverse Evan Prodromou One third of Americans say that social media has negatively impacted their mental health. Almost two thirds say that social media has been bad for democracy. But the majority of us still use social media on a daily basis. We clearly need better social media - enabling user choice or even platforms built and run by the users. The Fediverse is a coalition of social networking platforms that connect together, letting users interact across platforms while maintaining their independence. Evan is one of the authors of the ActivityPub standard that drives the Fediverse. He will discuss how the Fediverse went from a dream to a reality, and how individuals and communities can start exercising control over their own social platforms. Friday 1400 Little Theatre Invisible Ink of Compression XlogicX When you pop the hood of RFC 1951 (DEFLATE), there lies an interesting playground that would be otherwise unseen in the context of compression use cases. This talk will address many aspects of the ubiquitous DEFLATE compression, none of which involve compressing data! "Designer Compression" scenarios will be explored, such as blocks of DEFLATE data that can be fully ASCII printable, contain no data, buffer underflow access of nulls, and even apply forms of recursion. We will also see forensic data extraction from compressed fragments, employ difficult to detect watermarking, demo a covert channel PoC (deflate in http), and forever-cookies. The presentation style will take a high-level first pass and then dig into the technical details with the time left. Saturday 1500 Tobin 201/202 Itinerant Signal Institute (Rite of Spring) Amelia Marzec "Itinerant Signal Institute" is a project that leverages open source technology to examine and communicate about land use. As we move into an era of potentially increasing climate migration, the project aims to create a network of sensors that test environmental toxins. It examines the effect of local emissions on global climate change, using small devices that test the air and soil. That information is then shared via a portal. Imagery for the project will include ritual costumes that mark the changing of seasons. The project began with visits to polluted locations in New York City, including Governors Island (a former military base) and Newtown Creek (one of the most toxic waterways), and working with the Urban Soils Institute to collect information for the project. Friday 1500 Tobin 201/202 Leading and Survival When TSHTF - A Lighthearted Look at the End of the World George Sandford There's a moment when you realize that yes, everything may actually be on fire. As individuals, we can collapse, or we can take action to at least increase the odds of a positive outcome. As leaders (managers, parents, friends), we have to hold it together, fight to create safe spaces, keep our teams motivated, and somehow find time for self-care - without letting an active adversary turn us into the human equivalent of burnt toast. This talk will explore the art of leading in the midst of chaos, drawing on a punk ethos, irreverent humor, and a sprinkling of practical advice. You'll see how to preserve diversity and inclusion when everything feels like it's falling apart, how to support your team without losing your mind, and why it's okay to cry in the shower (just not every day). Saturday 1800 Little Theatre Media, Vibe Coding, and the Long Tail Lydia Laurenson What is even happening in the media now? There's a resurgence of paper magazines, and now they reach a long tail of subscribers due to the powers of the Internet. At the same time, social media platforms are downgrading in complexity and Signal chats have somehow become the new social media conversation. Everything old is new again, and it's all combining and recombining with weird emergent politics and independent vibe coders. This will be a discussion of the future of media, especially as seen within alternative cultures and the weird Internet. Friday 1300 Tobin 201/202 Meshtastic Attacktastic Dave "Heal" Schwartzberg In emergencies or off-grid scenarios, Meshtastic shines, but it can crumple when adversaries go off-script. Meshtastic is an open-source platform that allows for long-range, off-grid communication through LoRa-based mesh networks. While offering powerful tools for decentralized communication, particularly in remote areas or during emergencies, Meshtastic also introduces a set of security risks that could be exploited by adversaries. This talk explores the potential vulnerabilities within Meshtastic networks, focusing on attack vectors such as physical attacks, privacy leaks, key management, and jamming. Additionally, the effectiveness of the platform's encryption and authentication mechanisms will be analyzed, offering insights into how these systems can be compromised and how users can fend off attackers. This session will include a technical breakdown of known vulnerabilities and present both simulated and real-world examples of attacks on Meshtastic networks. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to defend against these threats, hardening their mesh networks against malicious actors. Whether you're a hobbyist experimenting with off-grid communications or a security professional assessing decentralized systems, this presentation will equip you with the tools and knowledge to secure your Meshtastic devices. Friday 1900 Tobin 201/202 New Journalism: Reimagining Information Networks From the Ground Up Patrick Boehler This presentation explores how communities are developing resilient information-sharing systems that outperform traditional journalism. Drawing from research on independent journalism in China, Patrick will examine how these organic networks function as advanced social technologies that challenge conventional understanding of information distribution. The talk invites the HOPE community to reimagine information infrastructure that can withstand authoritarian control, resist corporate manipulation, and genuinely serve community needs through collaborative problem-solving and the application of security expertise in distributed systems. Sunday 1300 Little Theatre Not Your Private Army: On the Trail of Cyber Ops Emma Best During the past two decades, hacktivist spaces have been infiltrated and co-opted by hostile interests, ranging from state actors to political and corporate entities and entitled oligarchs. This talk examines how these outside parties have attempted to build private cyber armies and task forces through the recruitment and exploitation of gray and black hat hackers. Special focus is given to the "Anonymous" brand, Western state actors, and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Saturday 1500 Marillac Auditorium NymVPN: The First Real-World Decentralized Noise-Generating Mixnet for Anonymity Harry Halpin Nym is the first decentralized noise-generating mixnet to provision real-world network anonymity to Internet users even against nation-state adversaries. The aim here is to supersede existing VPNs in order to fight increasingly more powerful authoritarianism and surveillance. Unlike traditional centralized VPNs that can be de-anonymized by a global passive adversary - like the NSA - based on their traffic patterns, Nym adds noise ("cover traffic") to existing Internet communications. Similar to Tor, Nym routes each packet separately over a decentralized network of servers, but unlike Tor, mixes traffic and adds noise at each hop. After being introduced at HOPE five years ago, NymVPN has now shipped. NymVPN is an easy to use app for all major operating systems that makes using the Nym network as easy as using a traditional VPN for ordinary people, with both a "fast" and "anonymous" mode. The "fast" mode features speeds comparable to centralized VPNs using the same decentralized network as the mixnet, but without mixing. Via the SDK, the Nym mixnet remains free to use by hackers to build the next generation of privacy infrastructure. Sunday 1400 Little Theatre Off-Grid Data Running in Oppressive Regimes: The Pirate Box Project (and Sneakernet!) LambdaCalculus In today's political climate in the U.S., the Internet as we know it is in danger of becoming heavily monitored, privatized, and censored. Information may only be what the corporations and government want you to see, and it may become difficult for marginalized and poor communities to have access to free information and education that the Internet provides. But by building an off-grid, mesh networked system known as the Pirate Box, it'll become a pivotal way of being the data runner your community needs. The Pirate Box is a form of Sneakernet, and this talk will give you a brief overview of both, as well as strategic tools and ways to make a Pirate Box of your own, along with projects in the spirit of the Pirate Box. Friday 2100 Tobin 201/202 Offworld Voyage: Can Training for Mars Exploration Also Address Human Adaptation to Climate Biodevastation on Earth? Scott Beibin, Elizabeth Jane Cole This talk will present the design philosophy behind Offworld Voyage, a decentralized science initiative that develops ecologically sustainable training habitats for use in simulated Mars surface exploration missions - while also solving for adaptation to extreme climate change on Earth. The Offworld Voyage M.A.R.S. Tesseract Space Analog Simulation Habitats were designed with a zero waste ethos for minimal environmental impact by inventor Scott Beibin and Michael Flood. The modular and portable structures of the habitats include: a bio-dome for cultivating organic vegan plant-based and fungi-based nutrition sources, autonomous power production, advanced waste reclamation, a science laboratory for experimentation and research, a space medicine bay, a fabrication lab for prototyping and repair, facilities for fitness and creativity as well as a kitchen and living quarters. Mission immersions incorporate a vision of the future when space has become accessible to all through the use of emerging ecologically sustainable appropriate technologies enabled by new types of egalitarian economic structures and coordination methods. Crew activities include EVA explorations in pressurized space suits outfitted with bio-sensors, 3D printed construction using regolith, utilization of open source communications tools, cooperative governance exercises and the practice of mutual aid and consensus decision-making in mission planning, problem-solving and self-sufficiency challenges in the face of extreme resource scarcity, simulated time-delayed communications, and experiments to analyze the effects of isolation on astronauts during offworld missions. The inaugural mission for the M.A.R.S. Tesseract habitats will occur in a remote desert location in late 2025. It will include the founders of the project, Scott Beibin and Elizabeth Jane Cole, who are both alumni of the Mars Desert Research Station (Mission 286) and core committee members of The Journal for Space Analog Research. Future plans for the project include the development of pressurized facilities and closed loop systems, as well as development of public goods including hardware and software for Space Analog Research and S.T.E.A.M-based educational programs. Saturday 1000 Little Theatre Packets Over Any Wire: Alternative Networking Mediums for Hackers Haxedalot Why limit yourself to Ethernet and Wi-Fi when every wire in your house can carry packets? This talk explores alternative physical networking technologies that exist but are often overlooked. From powerline networking (HomePlug AV/AV2) to MoCA over coaxial cables, the talk will dive into how these systems work, their encryption and security models, known exploits, and the inherent risks of non-switched cable mediums. Real-world applications, including whole-home audio and video distribution, network segmentation strategies, and the unexpected advantages of leveraging existing infrastructure will also be explored. You'll see how HDMI matrices, IP-based video distribution, and networked audio solutions like SonosNet can integrate seamlessly over alternative backbones. Segmentation techniques to isolate security cameras will also be covered. Expect deep technical insights, practical lessons from years of experimentation, and a fresh perspective on what's possible when you stop thinking of cables as just power or TV lines - and start treating them as network highways. Whether you're looking to expand connectivity in a complex environment or just want to push the limits of home networking, this talk will leave you with new tools, techniques, and ideas to explore. Friday 1700 Tobin 201/202 Phrack Magazine #72 - 40th Anniversary Release Party Netspooky, TMZ Celebrate 40 years of legendary hacking with Phrack Magazine! Netspooky and TMZ will be dropping a special hardcopy release of their magazine, packed with cutting-edge research, underground insights, and tributes to decades of digital rebellion. Don't miss this milestone issue - crafted by the hackers for the hackers. Free, of course, as always. Grab your copy, meet the crew, and honor the zine that defined an era. The talk will explain a bit about Phrack's history, how it all started, and where it's going - the vision of the new editorial staff and how Phrack is changing. You will get a rare insight into what it takes to run an underground hacking magazine. You'll learn what it's like to work with the many authors, reading and fixing articles, dealing with obscure submissions, and what it takes to get your article accepted and become an author in Phrack. For the first time ever, a "secret challenge" has been included in the hardcopy magazine for you to find and to solve. The prize for the winner will be revealed at the talk. Saturday 1700 Marillac Auditorium Piracy Is the Past, Present, and Future of Streaming Abigail De Kosnik, Benjamin De Kosnik Official ratings of TV viewership and box office revenues for films never tell the whole story of how people access popular media texts and instead promote platforms or corporations. Many millions around the world consume media through unofficial channels, especially peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks. In this session, you will be introduced to alpha60, an ongoing research project with six years of TV and film distribution data that reveals trends and oddities in global media desire. The speakers will present data on the quantity, timing, and location of downloads for major television series and films, offering data on unofficial global audienceship and speculating on new insights about cultural circulation, transnational belonging, and fandom. Saturday 1700 Tobin 201/202 Planning a Project That Has No Budget Travis Southard Projects are notoriously hard for developers to manage even with project managers, budget limits, and deadlines. Often in hacking and civic tech, we are our own PMs, funders, and timekeepers, which means projects can simultaneously have no budget and unlimited budget. Since a community is not paying for a particular feature, they have no "I think we've reached where we want to stop spending" moment, so when is something done? It doesn't cost our coworkers to ask for more features, so when are they asking too much? Travis will talk about his experiences as a professional nonprofit legal aid developer and as a volunteer project lead to explore what's helped him when working with nebulous conditions around specific requirements. Sunday 1600 Tobin 201/202 The Political and AI Singularity Are Inevitable - Or Are They? Roel Schouwenberg America's transition from a literary society to one shaped by social media and AI has revolutionized how we communicate, process information, and engage politically. AI's conversational nature deepens this shift, influencing culture and cognition. This talk will explore these new realities and provide insights into how to navigate them. Sunday 1600 Little Theatre The Present and Future of Online Discourse Harper Reed Today's technologies greatly empower individuals and groups, while simultaneously creating tremendous risks to freedom and privacy. How can major forces like big tech, artificial intelligence, and political governance be guided towards pro-social outcomes? What can individuals do? Is there hope for social media to heal divisions, rather than amplify discord? These and other topics will be addressed during this lively and far-ranging presentation. Friday 1300 Marillac Auditorium Print, Build, Fly, Heal: 3D-Printed Autonomous Planes for Medical Delivery in Rural Mexico Dana Gretton, Jaguar Kristeller This talk focuses on a project with medical students in Alamos, Sonora, Mexico to develop affordable delivery drones that can get urgent medical supplies to remote communities. What currently takes days to reach by mule through mountainous terrain can hopefully be accomplished in minutes by air. This talk chronicles the evolution from off-the-shelf hobby planes to locally-built, 3D-printed aircraft capable of autonomous waypoint missions. The speakers will discuss the technical choices behind their current $1000 prototype (and how they plan to cut costs in half), alongside the organizational structure they're developing to sustain this work. Recently, they established "club guilas" with local medical students - one of whom has completed pilot training for the test aircraft. The biggest challenges faced aren't the technical ones, but rather organizational sustainability: how to transition from a project driven by visiting engineers to one owned and operated by local communities. Plans will be shared for creating a federated network of university clubs, and the blueprint for a lean nonprofit structure to support them. Sunday 1100 Little Theatre PrivacySafe and 3NWeb: Engineering User-Centric Digital Sovereignty Mikalai Birukou We want to control the technology we use, and we want to trust it. At the same time, we expect it to be convenient. 3NWeb is a groundbreaking framework that gives users full control over their digital interactions across devices, while preserving privacy and independence from centralized systems. Grounded in core principles like the principle of least authority (PoLA) and web-style federation, 3NWeb reimagines how services should operate in a user-first Internet. This presentation includes a demo of PrivacySafe, a client-side 3NWeb platform that is real, downloadable, and ready to use today. Its careful implementation raises meaningful questions from a range of perspectives: users, organizational administrators, application developers, and service providers. The session will address practical considerations and continue with in-depth conversations in the hallway track. Friday 1200 Tobin 201/202 PrivacyTests.org: Web Browser Leak Testing Arthur Edelstein PrivacyTests.org is an open source privacy audit of popular web browsers. The project subjects web browsers to automated leak tests and regularly publishes the browsers' test results head-to-head on a website and on social media. The goal of PrivacyTests is to encourage all web browsers to mend their ways and comprehensively protect everyone's privacy. By thoroughly exposing the leaks in web browsers, the website helps users choose a more private browser, and thereby puts pressure on browser makers to fix their privacy leaks. In his talk, Arthur will give some details about the project's approach to testing and presenting test results, and show how browser privacy has evolved over the past four years. Friday 1600 Tobin 201/202 Quantum Computing and AppSec: Preparing for the Post-Quantum Threat Sheshananda Reddy Kandula Quantum computing is poised to disrupt modern cybersecurity. With the potential to break widely used encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, quantum threats pose a significant risk to web applications, APIs, and secure communications. This talk provides an introduction to quantum computing for application security professionals, outlines the threats to current AppSec practices, and explores how organizations can begin transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Attendees will leave with an understanding of the timeline, tools, and strategies required to prepare for the post-quantum world. Sunday 1000 Little Theatre The Quantum Curtain Ed Ryan High technology has taken on a new meaning. As AI technologies grow increasingly creepy and quantum computing catches major headlines, the U.S. government is scrambling to cover its posterior. Recognizing that these technologies pose a significant security risk, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security has imposed export controls on AI and quantum computing technologies in an attempt to limit their spread. This talk will discuss the history of export restrictions, touching on cryptography and the Playstation 2, before moving on to explain the new restrictions and their implications for those working in impacted fields. The idea of a "deemed export," which limits who is even allowed to learn about certain technologies, will be addressed. Friday 2000 Marillac Auditorium QWK Packets and the Muffled Spark Jason Scott A deep dive into the QWK packet - a revolutionary addition to the Bulletin Board Experience of the 1980s - and the ramifications of what it represents in a very changed world. Friday 1800 Marillac Auditorium RDP Spray and Pray: Research on Modern RDP Attacks From Spray to Exploit Tess Mishoe RDP has been around the block for a while. Since 1998, admins shudder at the mere mention of port 3389. It's anything but old-hat, though - even today, there are a lot of active attack methods and adaptations for the modern world. This talk will be going through the world of RDP attacks from the perspective of an attacker, a defender, and us - the researchers and engineers. Some mass RDP attack data will be showcased, along with how to identify, label, and further prevent these attacks in the future. Sunday 1000 Tobin 201/202 A Red Team Exercise 2025, 15 Years Later Tom Brennan, Vladislav Gostomelsky, Logan Klein This presentation is about red, blue and purple teams, along with the rest of the rainbow. Dig in for a fun and interactive presentation where the panel threat models and then attacks people, process, and technology. Bring your creative thinking and defensive skills and try to stop the... hackers. Friday 1700 Little Theatre rim: Reclaiming Personal Data Sovereignty in the Age of Wearables Dana Gretton, Jaguar Kristeller As we approach a future where body-worn devices capture increasingly intimate biometrics, the question of who controls that data has never been more urgent. This talk introduces rim, a techno-social vision and set of protocols challenging the standard model of cloud-based data extraction by building tangible, person-to-person systems for storing and sharing potentially intimate live data streams, innovating at the edge of taboo to expand human connection while preserving privacy and autonomy. There will be a demonstration of early prototypes of wearable devices implementing an "SD-core" aesthetic and detailing the technical underpinnings of protocol concepts including data "dissolution" and "crystallization" with erasure coding and intermittent connection tolerance. Beyond technical implementation, the presenters will discuss how this paradigm shift creates space for entirely new forms of human-to-human connection at the boundary of what's technically possible and socially acceptable. Saturday 1100 Little Theatre The Shape of the Legal Battlefield for InfoSec Professionals at Work Ken Vedaa It is no secret that sometimes there can be tension between InfoSec professionals and the organizations that they work for. Security professionals spend their days (and sometimes nights and weekends as well) buried in the dirty laundry that others pretend does not exist. These tensions can bubble up in unexpected ways. As an InfoSec professional, what are the common legal concerns that you need to be aware of at work? How do these challenges change over time? What should you keep in mind when considering a new job? Sunday 1200 Tobin 201/202 A Sleuth's Stories on Detecting and Revealing Large-Scale Research Fraud Mu Yang In this talk, the speaker will share how they stumbled into this work by accident and what it's like to operate as a scientific sleuth within academia. The bulk of the presentation will focus on real-world cases of research fraud and misconduct, spanning fields from neurodegenerative diseases to chemistry, physics, and materials science. The talk will, through these examples, explore: the techniques and tools used to detect irregularities; how issues are reported to journals and publishers; the distinction between honest mistakes and deliberate manipulation; the collateral damage caused by misconduct, including its impact on public trust in science. The final section will examine the social and economic drivers of research fraud - and outline the systemic changes needed, globally, to break this cycle and restore integrity in science. Friday 1200 Little Theatre Small Budget, Big Protection: Cyber Defense for SMBs Robert Wagner Small businesses often face significant challenges in defending their organizations with limited budgets. This talk will provide valuable insights into budget-friendly approaches to long-standing cybersecurity issues, helping small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) improve their security posture without excessive costs. Attendees will learn how to navigate the delicate balance between driving digital innovation and managing the risks of cyber threats and data breaches. Obstacles that prevent smaller companies from accessing affordable security resources will be explored along with practical solutions to overcome these hurdles. Many smaller organizations make the mistake of focusing solely on technology to solve their security problems, neglecting crucial aspects like people and processes. This talk will emphasize the importance of a holistic approach to cybersecurity, sharing strategies that larger companies have learned over decades. By understanding and implementing these strategies, SMBs can avoid common pitfalls and effectively raise their security standards. Attendees will leave with actionable tips on improving their cybersecurity practices within a limited budget, ultimately enhancing their overall defense capabilities. Friday 1500 Little Theatre Solving My Identity Crisis Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker Traditionally, Internet accounts are controlled by the service providing them. There is no 'number portability' for email addresses. Switching costs discourage service changes. Recently, Bluesky has disrupted this model and 32 million users now use account names based on the Internet identity infrastructure, DNS - names that users can register and control directly through DNS handle providers. This presentation will describe three standards proposals extending this approach. @nywhere extends the authentication approach to allow DNS handle accounts to be used at any Internet resource, not just those running ATprotocol. @nyone combines the DNS handle approach with JSContact to provide account portability and secure exchange of credentials for end-to-end secure communication. @nything allows network connected devices to become true Internet things with an Internet DNS name, WebPKI credentials, and using @nywhere and @nyone to support access control. Saturday 1800 Marillac Auditorium Spooky Action at a Discount: DIY Meshtastic Nodes Kody Kinzie To anyone interested in off-grid communication at a low cost, Meshtastic allows even beginners to communicate with (or control) devices from miles away. Thanks to applications in emergency communication, sensor monitoring, and censor-proof encrypted chat, Meshtastic is exploding in popularity even as the cost for making nodes is going down. This talk will cover the basics of Meshtastic, setting up and customizing nodes, plus outlining the tips and tricks to building affordable custom Meshtastic nodes, learned from building custom Nibble Meshtastic nodes for the conference. Attacks against Meshtastic and issues observed in the wild will also be covered. Expect to learn about LoRa, Meshtastic node and antenna options, how to deploy nodes for specific applications, attacks against Meshtastic, and how to join larger mesh networks in your local area! Friday 1100 Little Theatre StickTock.com: An Open-Source Alternative in the Age of Digital Protectionism Sean O'Brien The threatened U.S. ban on TikTok represents a turning point in global digital policy, reflecting the rise of "data tariffs" - restrictions on the movement of information modeled after traditional trade barriers. While concerns over privacy and national security have fueled the decision, the move also aligns with economic protectionism that benefits domestic tech giants. The fallout from this policy shift could further fragment the global Internet, leading to retaliatory restrictions against American firms and diminishing access to diverse digital platforms worldwide. In response, privacy advocates and open-source developers have taken action. StickTock.com is a free and open-source frontend for TikTok, designed to allow users to access and share TikTok content without invasive tracking, advertisements, or the need for a proprietary app. Built by the team at PrivacySafe, StickTock.com is hosted in Iceland - a jurisdiction with strong commitments to Internet freedom and privacy. Their mission is to demonstrate that digital independence and free speech can thrive in the face of restrictive policies. This talk will delve into the development of StickTock.com as a case study in open-source innovation as a means of circumventing censorship and preserving privacy. The challenges of building privacy-first digital alternatives, the broader implications of government-imposed digital barriers, and the future of decentralized platforms will be explored. In an era where the free flow of information is increasingly under threat, open-source solutions offer a critical pathway toward digital resilience and user autonomy. Saturday 1000 Marillac Auditorium The Struggle for Connection in a Fragmented World: Rebuilding Third Spaces Jack Gangi Third spaces - those vital, informal gathering places between home and work - have long been central to hacker culture, but they're vanishing. This talk will explore why third spaces matter more than ever for connection, creativity, and counterculture, and how we can rebuild them in a world increasingly fragmented by gentrification, digital monopolies, and social isolation. From hackerspaces to IRC to local meetups, Jack will trace our roots and offer ideas for rekindling authentic community, both online and off. Sunday 1700 Tobin 201/202 Systems of Dehumanization: The Digital Frontlines of the War Against Bodily Autonomy Daly Barnett This presentation covers the years of security research and surveillance investigations that Daly (a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation) has done on the various threats facing movements for bodily autonomy. She covers the bad Internet bills that made sex work more dangerous, the ongoing struggle for abortion access in America, and the persecution of trans people across all spectrums of life. These issue-spaces are deeply connected, and the digital threats they face are uniquely dangerous. Come to learn about these threat models, as well as the cross-movement strategies being built for collective liberation against an authoritarian surveillance state. Saturday 1500 Little Theatre Things You Wish You Knew About Software Testing Dan Nagle Everybody agrees that software testing is important, but how does one actually go about accomplishing this efficiently? Here is a presentation about testing that has actual examples, immediate tools that can be used, and some really interesting and unexpected ways that code can break. This is a fast moving presentation discussing techniques in a way that both coders and non-coders can learn. Saturday 1000 Tobin 201/202 Tips on Living Life in Interesting Times Mitch Altman What motivates us to do what we do? How do we find meaning in doing it? What makes us choose what we choose? Can we do better? What is important? Can we thrive and feel excellent, regardless of particular outcomes? These questions may now be more pressing than ever in our most interesting of times. Throughout our lives we tend to go with the flow of what is happening, making choices by default. Where do those choices come from? In the face of the rapidly changing and challenging times that we live in, personal and political, social and economic, can we find motivation to do what we do? Can we actually improve anything? Can we find and maintain enthusiasm to move forward into the unknown and feel good about our choices, regardless of outcome? Mitch will draw from lessons learned (and re-learned), doing his best to face the challenges while often haphazardly wandering through his 68 years on the planet. This talk will attempt to address these existential, important questions that we all face (whether consciously or not). Friday 2100 Marillac Auditorium Top Ten: Democratic Open Source Software Defined Radio and Amateur Radio Applications That Matter Today Steve Bossert A major benefit of the widely used open source Git platform is every project is voted on by its followers, making selection easy for what is the most popular and worth paying attention to. This presentation focuses on the top voted applications focused around software defined radio, as well as amateur "ham" radio. Time only permits the top ten to be covered. This is a great way to showcase how diverse these two crossover topic areas have become in recent years. Some projects are purely software-based while others are a mix of open source hardware plus software. High level coverage of these amazing projects will be included, but will be explored in more depth as part of a separate hands-on workshop during HOPE_16, making this presentation a must attend for anyone interested in radio-related topics! Saturday 1200 Tobin 201/202 The Trials and Tribulations of Building Your Own Phone Wesley Appler (aka lamemakes) Over the last two decades digital surveillance has become baked into our daily lives. Your current and past location, who you're in contact with, habits/interests, sensor data, and a trove of other personal information is constantly being sent to third parties by the smartphone that is nearly always carried on us. What would it look like if we reconsidered the mobile phone entirely, putting extra emphasis on privacy and intentional disconnection via open source hardware and software? This talk will follow Wesley's journey to do just that, starting at the conception of the idea, getting acquainted with mobile networks/operators, obtaining proprietary datasheets, designing hardware, failed/successful prototypes, the current state of the project (along with demos), and how any interested parties can get involved. Sunday 1100 Tobin 201/202 Turning Leaks Into Leads With OCCRP Aleph Ezana Ceman, Klil Eden You've got a leak, a name, or a suspicious company. What's your next move? In a world where corruption thrives in the shadows, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) provides the infrastructure to bring truth to light. At the core is Aleph, a powerful data platform built to help investigators follow the money and uncover complex networks across diverse sources. Bring your own data or explore the presenters' - the OCCRP data team collects and curates four billion records from nearly 200 countries, ranging from corporate registries and sanctions lists to court filings and leaked documents. This session will walk through how Aleph powers live investigations, transforming raw, chaotic data into structured insights that expose the actors and assets behind fraud and abuse of power. Designed by journalists, researchers, and developers on the frontlines, Aleph is more than a tool - it's a global community working together to uncover the truth. What will you find? Friday 1800 Little Theatre Unearthing Air Todd Whitney Breathing polluted air is an unfortunately common human experience. Yet even as particulate matter settles in our lungs and occupies our minds more than ever, most of us lack the words and abilities to create better breathing environments. This talk will invite the HOPE community to develop personal and proactive approaches to the air we breathe by bringing it down to earth. Air is invisible, but very material and personal. This talk demonstrates hacking opportunities in the tools we traditionally use to sense, measure, and make air make sense. The presenter will dive into communication tools like the air quality index, open source sensors, and the emerging ethics of community air quality monitoring. Importantly, everyone will come away with fresh frameworks and tools they can use to begin designing their personal pollution priorities. Saturday 1300 Tobin 201/202 When the Lawman Comes Calling - Government Data Demands and Online Platforms Fred Jennings Drawing on over a decade of experience, this talk will first introduce the statutes, rules, and concepts governing law enforcement requests for user data, ranging from basic subpoenas to secret FISA search warrants. From that foundation, the discussion will cover practical steps that web services and individual users can take to reduce their legal attack surface, minimize their risks, and maximize their protection from invasive data disclosures. Saturday 2000 Marillac Auditorium Zodiac Killer Marketing: How I Used Codes, Cyphers and Nefarious Means to Launch a Covert Food Business Chef Adam Sobel During the pandemic, Adam launched Galactic MegaStallion, a new vegan food business, but decided traditional marketing was boring and morally icky. Instead, he created an elaborate system of codes, cyphers, a mysterious hotline, and strategically (and illegally) placed billboards that led curious people to find his food through coordinates. This presentation will cover how and why he developed this unconventional marketing approach, and how breaking traditional marketing rules and business conventions actually built a delighted customer base. Saturday 1700 Little Theatre HOPE_16 Closing Ceremonies Nothing lasts forever and that even applies to HOPE (the conference, not the concept). We will reminisce about what happened this weekend as if it was a decade ago. And we can guarantee there will be many fun stories to share. If you're really lucky, you'll get to help us clean up! Sunday 1800 Marillac Auditorium

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has bounced back from a sell-off last week, climbing after a $9 billion earthquake. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price dropped to around $115,000 per bitcoin last week but has rebounded to touch $120,000, propelling the combined crypto market to back over $4 trillion and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as Elon Musk’s SpaceX sets bitcoin alarm bells ringing, analysts are predicting the wild bitcoin price swings that have rocked the market in recent years could be over. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “The days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over,” Mitchell Askew, a bitcoin analyst with the bitcoin miner Blockware, posted to X, echoing CryptoQuant chief executive Ki Young Ju who believes the bitcoin four-year cycle theory “is dead.” However, Askew also predicted that the bitcoin price will soar to $1 million over the next 10 years as it switches between “pump” and “consolidate" phases, adding: “It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions. Strap in.” Historically, the bitcoin price has climbed to all-time highs in the years following a bitcoin halving that sees the number of new bitcoin issued to miners in exchange for maintaining the network cut by half. Bitcoin saw significant price surges in the second halves of 2017 and 2021, following halvings that occurred in 2016 and 2020. Bitcoin’s last halving, cutting the bitcoin block reward to 3.125 bitcoins per block, happened in April 2024. Others have also said they believe the so-called four-year bitcoin price cycle is over, pointing to the huge accumulation of bitcoin over the last few years by first Michael Saylor’s Strategy then by bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers led by BlackRock Strategy now controls 600,000 bitcoin worth $72 billion, sparking a flood of copy cat companies who are buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while the combined bitcoin ETF issuers now hold 1.5 million bitcoin worth $175 billion. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious "The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it," Kyle Chassé, a bitcoin and crypto commentator, posted to X alongside a video he appeared in with Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. "The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic "four-year cycle" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year," Hougan said in the clip. “I think it’s more ‘sustained steady boom’ than super-cycle,” Hougan added. “I could be wrong, and I’m certain there will be significant volatility." Other analysts have though pointed to the possibility of unexpected events as either boosting or crashing the bitcoin price—something they warn could happen at any time. “This fifth bitcoin bull market has been characterized by bursts of momentum and sudden pauses, rather than a steady, high sharpe ratio climb,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of bitcoin price and crypto analysis company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. “Each move has hinged on a clear catalyst: Fed rate expectations, Trump’s political traction, ETF breakthroughs, or regulatory interventions, such as the dismantling of crypto-friendly banks. That’s why staying laser-focused on macro triggers and reacting quickly to breakouts remains critical. In crypto, momentum is sparked by events, not driven by the calendar.”

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Arbitrage or market manipulation? Jane Street believes it is an uber-efficient arbitrageur. It spotted pricing anomalies between index options and the index’s stock constituents, and used sophisticated trading models to profit from the arbitrage. The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) order has some interesting findings. On 17 January 2024, the expiry day for Bank Nifty derivatives, the index opened 2% lower due to weak earnings of some of its constituents. However, options on the Bank Nifty traded at a level where the implied price was higher, resulting in an anomalous price spread. JS did what textbooks tell us: buy stocks that make up the Bank Nifty while selling options on this index. The trade worked as textbooks say it would: the spread narrowed within six minutes. But here’s the twist: the total value of Bank Nifty stocks purchased was ₹572 crore while the total notional value of the options sold was ₹8,751 crore, which is more than 15 times. This oddity continued. By mid-day, JS had bought Bank Nifty stocks and futures worth over ₹5,000 crore and sold options worth over ₹30,000 crore. Arbitrage is about hedging, but one doesn’t hedge a bet on India winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by placing 15 bets on India not-winning it. So JS started selling its stock/futures positions. But liquidity in these segments is so low that its trades tanked prices, resulting in losses for JS in its long index positions. But its large short options position (5-6 times in notional exposure to its cash/futures positions) got settled at market close at a massive profit. In short, JS appeared to move prices in the illiquid leg of the market (cash/futures) so that it could profit from its large position in the liquid leg (options).

Either way, Sebi’s order has acted as the proverbial canary in the coal mine to reveal potentially poisonous fumes in our capital markets. Fume 1—Lopsided market structure: India’s equity market is the second largest among emerging economies by market capitalization and volumes both. However, volumes are skewed—over 90% are in derivatives (futures and options or F&O), with options accounting for the bulk. The cash segment is shallow. Daily volumes in the shares of HDFC Bank, the largest Bank Nifty constituent, for instance, are only about ₹2,000 crore. To put this in context, the total equity assets under management of India’s mutual funds (MFs) are over ₹30 trillion, with ₹50-60,000 crore worth of flows every month. This skew causes distortions. Also Read: Andy Mukherjee: Jane Street’s secret sauce for Indian markets should be tested out Fume 2—Skewed tax structure: A small ₹5,000 crore trade could move prices because there is no countervailing Indian entity that’s able to provide liquidity by playing the other side of JS’s ‘arbitrage’ trades. The reason is simple—tax rules. In India, the securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives is a fraction of what it is on stocks, incentivizing investors to move to F&O from the cash segment. Further, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) enjoy a large tax advantage over Indians. FPIs’ F&O trades qualify for capital-gains tax (and are taxed at 20% if short-term and 12.5% if long-term), but for Indian entities, the same gains are deemed to be income (taxed at 25% for corporates and 39% for individuals/trusts). Fume 3—Regulation stifles Indian institutions: For many years, FPIs provided the dominant share of liquidity in Indian stock markets. Over the last decade, Indian institutions, especially MFs, have risen in stature and now account for a larger share of India’s market capitalization and volumes than FPIs. This provides a diversified pool of liquidity in the cash segment. But in the F&O segment, a regulatory overhang prevents the creation of such counterweight liquidity. Why? Also Read: Jane Street: Gaming an outdated system is not necessarily illegal in India First, domestic institutional investors are mostly not allowed to use leverage, but FPIs are. Second, short-selling, which lets market participants act on bearish views, exists mostly in the realm of theory; its process is such that participation and liquidity are low. Third, a prudential aversion to leverage has left F&O trading as its only source. Bank lending to capital markets is heavily circumscribed and non-banking financial companies have limited capacity to lend. This reduces domestic market liquidity and pushes participants towards the F&O segment. Fourth, while there are all sorts of limits in equity markets, index options face none. This means participants can build positions in index options many times the stock position limits on the underlying stocks. Fifth, a very high proportion of market liquidity is concentrated in short-term options contracts. India is unique as a large market with zero liquidity in derivatives of more than three months tenor. Also Read: Sebi’s Jane Street interim order made India’s stock market sit up for good reason Solutions are within grasp: India’s financial markets are world class. So are its regulators (think of Sebi and the Reserve Bank of India). Diversified liquidity is the lifeblood of any well-functioning market. Small tweaks in tax laws, alongside a rethink on the flexibility afforded to Indian institutions (especially MFs) would be a great fresh start. The appointment of market-makers for longer-dated derivatives is another idea that is well-tested in India; in the 1990s, RBI licensed a slew of primary dealers as market-makers for government bonds with great results. India’s capital markets are valuable. Sebi has done its bit as the canary by highlighting emergent risks. It is time now to make space for fresh ideas so that the mine continues to prosper for India.

Title: GE’s 400% Breakup Return Is A Wake-Up Call For Every CEO
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimosman/2025/07/27/ges-400-breakup-return-is-a-wake-up-call-for-every-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-07-27T17:15:22Z
Full Content:
ByJim Osman ByJim Osman, Senior Contributor. There was a time when GE symbolized everything wrong with corporate bloat. I wrote about it in 2019, covering the damage done by Welch’s financial engineering, Immelt’s empire-building, and the pension time bomb that dragged the company into long-term decline. It became a cautionary tale for investors who confused brand power with balance sheet strength. The GE breakup is now a success story that everyone, particularly CEOs, should be aware of. What followed would have been unthinkable at the time. GE has now delivered a 400 percent return to shareholders through one of the most effective corporate breakups in recent history. This was not a lucky outcome. It was a structural reset. Larry Culp did not save GE by patching it up. He saved it by dismantling what no longer worked and letting the market revalue the parts. The result is not just a comeback story. It is a signal to every CEO sitting on underperforming assets that the path to value is already in plain sight. Culp did what many before him were unwilling to do. He separated GE into three focused businesses: aviation, healthcare, and energy. It was a structural necessity. Each business had a distinct capital profile, a different growth outlook, and a unique investor base. For years they had been buried inside a complex, legacy-driven machine that masked their true value. The aerospace unit became GE Aerospace, a pure-play with visibility, margins, and scale. GE Healthcare stepped into a sector where clarity and comparables drive multiples. GE Vernova, the energy unit, aligned with the market's demand for clean transition and infrastructure exposure. These were not spinoffs in name alone. Each company now controls its own cost base, strategy, and capital allocation decisions. That separation of function is exactly what the market needed. It created three investable stories, not one misunderstood puzzle. This is why The Edge focuses on these types of situations, not just valuation screens. A business is only as valuable as its structure allows it to be. When that structure is misaligned, price alone tells you nothing. GE’s transformation is proof that when incentives and operations are realigned, the value follows quickly. Once the separation plan was set in motion, the market responded with precision. Investors didn’t need another narrative. They needed clarity. With each division operating independently, the ability to assign real multiples returned. GE Aerospace quickly established itself as a dominant player in a post-COVID aviation cycle. GE Vernova captured attention as a levered play on energy transition and grid modernization. GE Healthcare stepped into its own, attracting sector-focused capital that once ignored the parent entirely. What resulted was a strong re-rating. The market priced the businesses as they were, not as they had been hidden inside a tangled conglomerate. I called this early in my 2024 Forbes piece on GE’s revival, when the breakup began to gain traction with institutions. Barron’s followed with a lead feature quoting my assessment of Culp’s plan. The message was the same: the market doesn’t reward some fantastic ideas (this can be the major problem with turnarounds); it rewards a laid-out, quantifiable structure. Once that changed, so did the stock. The 400 percent return was the consequence, not the goal. What set the GE breakup in motion wasn’t a new product or a market shift. It was leadership. Larry Culp saw what his predecessors refused to acknowledge. GE didn’t need to be fixed. It needed to be stripped back. For decades, successive CEOs measured success by size—more divisions, more deals, more complexity. Culp reversed that thinking and proved that focus, not scale, is what drives shareholder return. Under Welch and Immelt, GE had become a monument to corporate ego. Diversification was seen as strength, even as the market lost the ability to value the parts. Culp understood that investors don’t want a riddle. They want clean stories, clear numbers, and defined upside. This same leadership vacuum now exists at Boeing. I laid that out earlier this year in a piece calling for a rockstar CEO to take the reins. The lesson applies across sectors. If leadership isn’t aligned with structure, value will stay hidden. The GE breakup worked because someone was finally willing to make hard decisions. Despite the success of the GE breakup, most CEOs still avoid this path. Not because it lacks merit, but because it requires a level of self-awareness that many don’t possess. Breaking up a business means admitting that the structure you built no longer serves shareholders. That’s a hard pill to swallow for executives whose careers were spent expanding, acquiring, and defending size as a strategy. The diversification myth still holds power. It gives the illusion of stability while masking underperformance. The market doesn’t want blended results. It wants exposure to what works, without the drag of what doesn’t. The real reason more companies don’t follow GE’s lead is simple. Change threatens control. A breakup reduces influence, reshapes org charts, and opens management to scrutiny. So instead of running toward structural change, most CEOs run from it. That choice may protect their tenure, but it leaves shareholder value locked in the shadows. The GE breakup reminds us where real alpha lives. It is not found in low multiples or discounted cash flows alone. It is found in structure, timing, and the presence of a catalyst. A cheap stock without change is just a value trap and I always speak about cheap stocks becoming cheaper. A misunderstood business in the middle of a structural shift? That’s an opportunity. This is what I wrote about in Price Catalysts: “Value without a trigger is just dead money.” The market doesn’t reward potential. It rewards movement. That’s why the GE story mattered. The setup was there for years—misunderstood assets, bloated overhead, misaligned capital. But only when the structure changed did the return appear. At The Edge, this is where we focus. We don’t chase momentum or screen for what’s cheap. We look for businesses on the verge of transformation. Spin-offs. Restructurings. Activist pressure. Forced selling. These are not stories. They’re setups. GE wasn’t a surprise to those watching the structural pressure build. It was a long-awaited release of value the market had simply stopped believing in until it couldn’t ignore it anymore. The GE breakup is no longer a case study. It’s a playbook. Every CEO and board now has a real-world example of what happens when structural change meets disciplined leadership. Mediocre boards can’t pretend anymore. You don’t need a new product, a market shift, or the perfect macro backdrop. You need a willingness to rethink what you’ve built and the courage to unlock what’s already there. The same logic applies to other conglomerates hiding value. Boeing still carries too much weight from its disjointed divisions. Johnson & Johnson took a step in the right direction but stopped short of full separation. Consumer giants with sleepy product lines and overgrown portfolios are no different. You don’t need new tech. You need new thinking. The GE breakup didn’t invent value. It revealed it. And it showed that the fastest way to deliver shareholder returns is often the hardest, changing the very structure that once defined you. GE waited until it had no choice. Most companies do. But the GE breakup shows what happens when the right leadership acts before the market demands it. The value was always there. Value release sometimes needs a catalyst. If you’re running a company sitting on undervalued assets, you have a decision to make. Wait until you’re forced into action or lead the revaluation yourself. Because if you don’t unlock the value, someone else will. And when they do, it won’t be on your terms. The playbook is open. Time is not on your side.

Title: Wells Fargo Warns Fed Rate Cut and Additional Catalysts Could Trigger Pullback for Group of Assets – Here’s the Bank’s Outlook

Banking titan Wells Fargo is unveiling a scenario that could trigger a correction for artificial intelligence (AI)-focused stocks. In a new CNBC interview, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, says investors are skeptical about the sustainability of stock market rallies after equities rebounded in a massive way from the April lows. Rather than a pullback, Harvey expects the stock market to consolidate as he sees the Fed cutting rates in the coming months. “A lot of people are looking for a pullback. They are talking about things being overextended. They’re talking about uncertainty with the Fed, and earnings and lions, tigers and bears, oh no. I don’t know what the short term holds. I think we could see a consolidation. It’s really unclear for me, but the underlying fundamentals: still strong. We do think the Fed will certainly have to be dovish in the next couple of months, and what we also think is that rates are going to rally because the deficit, in all likelihood, while not going to be good, will probably be better than expected based on some of the tariff news that we’re getting.” Looking at the tech sector, Harvey warns that a string of good news could hurt the AI trade. He notes that a more favorable macroeconomic landscape could stimulate risk-taking behavior and encourage investors in AI stocks to seek higher gains in other sectors. “One thing I think that could potentially hurt the AI trade is if you do get the Fed cutting, if growth is better than expected, if rates do come down, suddenly the contrarian trade starts to look better, and you could see rotation. And I think that’s the biggest fear for AI right now.” Popular AI names include Nvidia, AMD, Palantir, Microsoft, Meta and Google.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season: Google Reinforces The AI Story
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/07/27/second-quarter-earnings-season-google-reinforces-the-ai-story/
Time Published: 2025-07-27T10:51:09Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. This week is the busiest of the second-quarter earnings season, with 161 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Merck (MRK), Starbucks (SBUX), Mastercard (MA), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B). Four of the Magnificent 7 are also on the docket this week. According to FactSet, 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 34% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 6.4% year-over-year, above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 9.6%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.9%. The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high last week. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed primarily due to Tesla’s performance. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Tesla entered the earnings season with low expectations, but it failed to impress with its report last week. Tesla was the worst-performing member of the Magnificent 7, falling 4.1% last week. Alphabet, parent of Google, was expected to report robust earnings growth and managed to exceed expectations, sending the stock 4.4% higher for the week. Alphabet’s cloud revenue soared by 31.7% year-over-year, with improving operating margins. Data suggests that their artificial intelligence (AI) search is growing, without the feared decline in monetization. Google increased its planned 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion, reflecting its confidence in the AI outlook, but investors are (rightly) always cautious about massive capital investments. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) after the close on Wednesday, then Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) after the close on Thursday. Positive earnings surprises from the financial and communication services sector were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Capital One Financial (COF) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 5.0% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. If the estimates of second-quarter nominal year-over-year GDP growth of 4.7% are correct, there could be limited upside to sales growth from here. Better sales results in the communication services and healthcare sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. In addition to earnings, the economic calendar is packed with crucial releases this week after a lull last week. The first look at second-quarter US economic growth comes on Wednesday. GDP growth is expected to rebound to 2.4% after a decline in the first quarter. In contrast to the first quarter, the headline GDP number is likely to overstate the economy’s strength due to fluctuations in trade related to tariffs. The Federal Reserve (Fed) rate meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, with essentially no chance of any change to rates. Instead, market participants will be looking for clues as to when the next Fed rate cut will occur. Markets are currently pricing in a 66% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the September meeting. News about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a focus. Significant new tariffs are currently scheduled to take effect on August 1, unless an acceptable trade agreement is reached. Sectoral tariffs could also be announced. As a positive note, a trade deal framework with Japan was announced last week, providing reason for optimism about additional agreements with other nations. Also on Friday, the monthly jobs report is expected to continue showing modest but slowing growth in nonfarm payrolls. The unemployment rate is expected to reverse last month’s decline and increase to a still low 4.2%. Stocks continue to be boosted by the twin forces of better-than-expected earnings and a receding threat of recession. The betting odds of a 2025 recession fell to the lowest level of the year, while stocks reached an all-time high.

Here's where you can put that cash right now, according to six Wall Street veterans. On the agenda today: But first: How do they do it? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here. Ever wonder how the world's most accomplished business leaders make it all look so effortless? How do they conquer jam-packed calendars, build empires, and still find time to fly helicopters or sip matcha in peace? Welcome to Power Hours, a fresh Business Insider series that peels back the curtain on the daily routines of top CEOs, founders, and creative visionaries. We're going deep on what makes these high performers tick — and how you can apply their secrets to your own life. We've gone behind the scenes with leaders like Peter Beck, CEO of Rocket Lab, who starts his day before sunrise, ruthlessly cuts out unnecessary meetings, and flies a helicopter in his spare time. David Risher, CEO of Lyft, winds down with afternoon matcha and occasionally goes undercover as a driver to stay connected to his mission. Here's a snapshot of some of the leaders we've profiled. Each Power Hours profile delivers a dose of inspiration — and a toolkit of takeaways — for readers to better understand how the pros do it all. So, what are your Power Hours? Let us know, we'd love to hear from you! For years, the Spaghett — a mix of cheap beer and Aperol — was known almost exclusively by service industry workers. Now, it's making its way into the spotlight. The Spaghett's rise is also a sign that the economy is on the edge of disaster. It's a lot cheaper than other cocktails and easy to make at home — a standout choice for when you feel pressure on your wallet. No frills, great flavor. The silver lining of mass layoffs is that no one has to go through it alone. From former Big Tech workers to laid-off federal employees, old coworkers are banding together on networks like Slack and Signal. In their private channels, laid-off workers offer each other more than just emotional support. They're helping each other navigate the confusing administrative tasks that come with being fired, sharing job postings, and engaging in mock interviews. Experts say it reflects a surge in worker resistance. Secretive investors are betting big on the next homebuilding boom. Known as "land bankers," these investors are scooping up construction-ready real estate and waiting until builders are ready to put shovels in the ground. The result would be a more reliable homebuilding machine and even cheaper homes. That's great news for homebuyers in the near future. A new breed of land barons. Big Tech companies and startups are racing to dominate the next frontier of AI, and they're shelling out top dollar to the limited pool of tech talent who will join them.

Title: Inside the Private Equity Scam—and the Livelihoods It Has Destroyed
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/198351/private-equity-scam-destroys-livelihoods
Time Published: 2025-07-27T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
In 2019, when I was working what I have grudgingly come to accept may be one of the best jobs I’ll ever have, my employer, Gizmodo Media Group, was acquired by a private equity firm called Great Hill Partners. Private equity had not shown itself to be a great friend of journalism: Alden Global Capital, another firm, had just gutted the Pulitzer Prize–winning Denver Post. Still, my colleagues and I on the company’s investigative team were cautiously optimistic about the new management, personified by our new CEO, an executive named Jim Spanfeller, who had previously run Forbes’s digital arm. Following a rough few years, an infusion of cash seemed like it could be a good thing. Our soft skepticism, it turns out, was disastrously naïve. Within days of the sale, both of my editors had been fired by people who did not appear to know they had direct reports, leaving my team to collect paychecks without any actual work to do—a particularly comical hit, given the firm’s alleged goal to eradicate waste. Out of a sense of duty, most of us assigned ourselves to other sites within the company. But the new management insisted we replace much of our reporting with slideshows to artificially inflate our audience. Invasive, auto-playing ads became such a problem that we fielded constant complaints from our readers. Our product and sales teams disappeared. People routinely left meetings frazzled and burdened by bizarre mandates with little data to back them up. I stuck it out for a while; I truly adored my job reporting alongside people who alternately delighted and intimidated me, journalists I had admired for years. I finally made the decision to quit when management rewrote a sensitive story, entirely fabricating key details, and tried to pass the work off as my own. It wasn’t just that the company was being run poorly, or that Great Hill was trying to squeeze every last penny out of our labor. It was that the people in charge seemed actively hostile to our attempts to do good, ethical, even profitable work. No one is going to visit a website they can’t trust or even use. I’m not a businessman, but a libel lawsuit seems bad for the bottom line. And there was something almost hallucinatory about working under people with such a vague grasp of our corner of the industry, who were so deeply incurious about the work that went into the brands they were allegedly trying to save. Meanwhile, across the office, the journalist Megan Greenwell was struggling with a much higher-profile version of this conundrum. As was extensively reported in the New York media press, Greenwell, then the editor in chief of the anarchic and beloved sports site Deadspin, publicly resigned four months after Great Hill purchased our company. “The tragedy of digital media isn’t that it’s run by ruthless, profiteering guys in ill-fitting suits,” she wrote in an eviscerating blog post announcing her departure. “It’s that the people posing as experts know less about how to make money than their employees, to whom they won’t listen.” Greenwell’s entire staff followed her lead shortly after, mass quitting largely in protest of a mandate to abandon higher-traffic stories about politics and internet oddities (and irreverent classics like “my enemies in nature, ranked”) to focus entirely on sports. In the years since, the Deadspin story has become something of a parable about media and private equity and the ultimate value of those guys in the ill-fitting suits. Following the resignation, a number of former Deadspin writers launched Defector, a worker-owned publication that claimed 40,000 paid subscribers as of last year. And, as Greenwell writes in Bad Company, her wide-ranging account of private equity’s impact on American life, over a period of less than five years, Great Hill executives ran Deadspin so far into the ground that it “draws slightly less traffic than a Pennsylvania dog breeder called greenfieldpuppies.com.” Last spring, the remaining writers were laid off and the brand sold to a Maltese company with plans to feature “gambling content” on the site. Almost all of the 12 websites that Great Hill originally purchased have been auctioned off in severely depleted states. This July, Spanfeller announced that G/O Media (as the collection of sites was rebranded) was “working towards a full wind down,” noting “we will exit having increased shareholder value.” Years later, I still acutely remember the shock of watching a few guys armed with little more than inspirational quotes turn a functional if imperfect company into a series of spammy content farms. “Making it difficult to know what’s going on is exactly the point of so much about how private equity operates,” argues Greenwell in Bad Company. She follows four people in disparate industries—retail, health care, journalism, and housing—trying, as we did at Gizmodo Media, to understand why people claiming to revitalize our companies did exactly the opposite. For people who genuinely desire functional, vibrant institutions, funds like Great Hill can represent not just a logistical but an emotional challenge. It’s not easy to watch something you depend on, and spent countless hours analyzing and agonizing over, systematically stripped for parts. Greenwell’s book seeks to answer the questions many people at the receiving end of a private equity takeover want to know: Who are these people, how did they get here, and what on Earth do they actually want? Ostensibly, private equity firms flip underperforming private companies kind of like houses: The firms raise capital to buy “distressed assets” wholesale, take out (often massive) loans to cover a rehabilitation job, and pay their investors when the business either goes public or is sold. Greenwell locates the origin of these leveraged buyout arrangements in the “bootstrap deals” of the 1960s, when financial firms took on companies that were successful but too small to go public. Within a decade, opportunistic executives started targeting larger companies. By the ’80s, hostile takeovers of Fortune 500 companies became common, if not exactly the norm. Today’s private equity landscape is vast: Once you’re attuned to the industry’s hold on nearly every aspect of American life, it feels impossible to escape. My local grocery, an iconic New York institution once owned by a family that pledged to hire union-represented locals and maintain the lowest prices in the city, was sold in 2020 to a national chain after a takeover from Sterling Investment Partners. On my beat, covering the health care industry, I was regularly confronted with the realities of staffing shortages and closures stemming in part from private equity firms’ attempts to bring budgets down to cover their debt. And I saw private equity’s obsession with becoming “agile” and “lean” reflected in the way the Department of Government Efficiency has deliriously hacked away at programs it has neither the capacity nor the will to understand. As recounted in Greenwell’s book, stories like these aren’t simply anecdotal. Private equity’s influence on the economy, and our livelihoods, is significant. Twelve million Americans, she writes, work for companies that are owned by private equity. The industry operates 8 percent of private hospitals, four out of five of the largest for-profit day care chains, and currently controls $8.2 trillion in assets—a number that accounts for more than the GDP of any country besides China and the United States. And, where 2 percent of companies go bankrupt within 10 years of their founding, that number jumps to 20 percent when private equity is involved. Between 2009 and 2019, 1.3 million Americans working in retail lost their jobs as a direct result of the industry’s touch. Bad Company offers a few reasons why private equity firms aren’t successfully turning their “distressed assets” around, the most relevant of which is that it pays investors just as well, if not better, to run a company into the ground. (Gordon Gekko’s “Greed is good” speech from the movie Wall Street makes two separate appearances in the book, both entirely appropriate.) Decades of aggressive lobbying and cozy relationships with politicians have favored these firms, which style themselves publicly as “brash swashbucklers, eager to be the hero,” swooping in at their own risk to rescue businesses in distress. But in practice, Greenwell argues, private equity bears vanishingly little risk. And its mandate to not just profit but maximize shareholder value has the effect of abstracting critical industries to a point where, the author writes, “a company doesn’t even need to exist at all.” If reducing the quality of service, selling off real estate, and collecting fees are more profitable than running a successful business, argues Greenwell, “liquidation is not just the best option, but indeed the only one.” Today, when a private equity firm borrows money to “save” a company, the debt is almost always carried not by the firms that purchased a company, but by the company itself. Standard takeover deals include what’s known as a 2-and-20 clause: Funds take a 2 percent management fee of all assets under their control, as well as 20 percent of all profits above a certain threshold. This is in addition, writes Greenwell, to a range of other common payouts, including monitoring and transaction fees. As one team of researchers found over a decade ago, as much as two-thirds of a private equity firm’s profits typically come from these kinds of management fees. Many deploy sale-leaseback arrangements to make a quick buck, selling off property and requiring acquired companies to pay rent on real estate they once owned. And then there are classic cost-saving measures like mass layoffs. “Taken together,” Greenwell writes, “it is very, very difficult for private equity to lose money.” In this context, whether a company provides anything of value beyond dividends to investors is somewhat beside the point. Private equity’s central conceit is that financiers, not skilled workers or industry experts, are best positioned to figure out what makes any given business work. In her reporting, Greenwell makes a detailed argument for the fundamental misguidedness of this stance. Many private equity managers don’t know very much at all about the businesses they run. They’re experts in markets, not trades. So it’s no wonder they hop from industry to industry deploying the same tactics, cutting jobs and saddling companies with debt and inking extractive real estate deals. Hospitals, newspapers, rental apartments, and toy stores have wildly different business models. But to a private equity firm, they’re all the same. Over the course of Bad Company, Greenwell follows four people whose lives have been altered by a private equity takeover. The history and policy analysis act as a scaffolding for these stories; it’s in these intimate portraits that the book truly shines. Though never stated outright, the experiences of Greenwell’s subjects act as a powerful foil to a certain kind of managerial thinking that is implicit at the heart of private equity’s pitch: that profits could only possibly matter to the people in charge of the ledgers, that employees need to be micromanaged, that businesses suffer because of a lack of commitment from the people who clock in and out every day. In other words, Greenwell managed to find a collection of characters utterly devoted to what they do. Liz, an Alaskan mother trying to lift her family out of chronic instability, worked for the retail giant Toys “R” Us, which declared bankruptcy and axed 33,000 employees without severance when private equity–imposed debt made it impossible to keep shelves stocked. Liz loved working at Toys “R” Us so much that she got a tattoo of the company’s signature giraffe. As recounted by Greenwell, after a particularly satisfying customer service experience, a pair of new parents gave their baby her name. A physician named Roger abandoned a cushy job decades ago to practice medicine in rural Wyoming. Now in his eighties and retired, he reflects on his battle to maintain essential medical services, like maternity care, following a series of acquisitions. “You want to leave a place better than you found it,” he tells Greenwell through tears. Natalia, a Texas journalist born in Mexico, ping-ponged between private equity–owned papers, making less than $60,000 a year in Austin and maintaining significant debt to write stories that would resonate with younger, Spanish-speaking audiences. Greenwell also spent time with Loren, a parent whose private equity–backed low-income housing complex flooded, ejecting residents from their homes with no recourse. She is still handing her number out to residents of the building, helping them file complaints from afar. These are not people who need dividends to commit. Throughout Bad Company they find creative ways to circumnavigate the constrictions placed on them by faceless billion-dollar firms. They work longer hours and organize their neighbors. They unionize and campaign. They leverage their tangible connections to their communities to combat people they’ve never met in gleaming Manhattan office towers they’ll never see. In comparison, the copy-paste labor private equity firms perform looks awfully lazy. Intermittently, Bad Company touches on the stories the men in the suits tell one another, and the public, about their critical societal role. “The enduring myth of the lone business genius creating a Fortune 500 company, or saving one from destruction, has benefited private equity immeasurably,” Greenwell writes. She notes that giants of the finance industry like Mitt Romney are rewarded with Senate seats, and that the central branch of the New York Public Library, the MIT computing school, and Yale’s performing arts center all bear the name of Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of Blackstone. The idea that these men are facilitating the process of free-market natural section has contributed to a lack of meaningful regulation—though the donations the private equity industry throws to politicians of both parties certainly don’t hurt. Most memorably, Greenwell describes a Machiavelli quote that once hung in the private conference room of a senior partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the hundred-billion-dollar firm responsible for Toys “R” Us’s leveraged buyout as well as hundreds, if not thousands, of others: “There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its outcome, than to take the lead in introducing a new order of things,” it read. But Greenwell, through her thorough accounting of four companies’ acquisitions and rapid declines, illustrates just how musty that order of things has become, or maybe has always been. Another story the private equity industry likes to tell is that its work is crucial and inevitable, because the companies it acquires suffer from a “failure to thrive” from which there is no turning back. According to this logic, the companies in which Greenwell’s subjects lived and worked were pronounced dead long before funds stepped in to profit from their distress. Toys “R” Us could never survive the shift to e-commerce. Rural hospitals had to consolidate and cut services or face extinction. Declining ad revenue killed journalism. There was simply no other path. But, as Greenwell points out, there are successful retail operations and small hospitals and profitable publications operating in this country today. Many apartment buildings manage to house residents without flooding their apartments or turning off the heat. Extracting every ounce of shareholder value from these companies was far from inevitable—and it’s certainly much harder for an organization to adapt to changing conditions when it’s shedding workers and crippled under a mountain of debt. Of course, it’s impossible to know how any individual company would have fared without private equity’s involvement. Greenwell detours to earlier instances of managerial ineptitude that proved fateful before new ownership stepped in. It could have been in Toys “R” Us’s foolish early deals with Amazon, or the conventional wisdom that underperforming medical centers should slash services, or newspapers’ sluggishness to embrace new models in the digital age. Those were all decisions made by highly paid executives, too. In this sense, Bad Company is a call to bring more creativity and expertise to our country’s critical institutions—to extract them from the hands of people for whom a business isn’t a dynamic entity full of actual people but instead a collection of assets and debts.

Title: What Analysts Think of Microsoft Stock Ahead of Earnings

Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell today, with Wall Street resoundingly bullish on the software giant heading into the results. All 20 analysts covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Their consensus price target around $580 implies 13% upside over Tuesday's close just above $512, after setting a record high Friday at $513.71. The shares have added about a fifth of their value in 2025 so far, hovering around $512 in recent trading. Wedbush, which has Microsoft on its "Best Ideas List," recently raised its price target to $600. The company "is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front," Wedbush said, thanks to the adoption of Copilot, its chatbot, and the cloud-computing platform Azure. Revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, is expected to grow 22% to $28.96 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts have called Microsoft their "top pick," giving it a price target of $613. The bank said Microsoft has pricing and margin power that is "nearly unmatched in enterprise software." Jefferies analysts issued a price target of $600 earlier this month. Analysts on average expect Microsoft to report quarterly revenue of $73.86 billion, up 14% year-over-year, and net income of $25.27 billion, or $3.38 per share, compared to $22.04 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street will be watching for updates on Microsoft's AI spending ambitions in fiscal year 2026, which began this month. In April, CFO Amy Hood said capital expenditures are expected to grow this fiscal year, but at a slower rate than in fiscal 2025. Microsoft at the time said it expected $80 billion of capex in fiscal 2025. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) last week raised its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion. Rival hyperscaler Meta (META), like Microsoft, is set to report earnings after the bell today. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) are slated to follow tomorrow. UPDATE—July 30, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

All 20 analysts covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Their consensus price target around $580 implies 13% upside over Tuesday's close just above $512, after setting a record high Friday at $513.71.

Title: Here Are Three Questions Investors Want Answered In Big Tech Earnings This Week
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/here-are-three-questions-big-tech-earnings-this-week-meta-microsoft-apple-amazon-11779269
Time Published: 2025-07-27T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Second-quarter earnings season will kick into high gear this week. Four of the world’s largest companies—Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—are set to report their results. Artificial intelligence will be the focus for many investors, who will be hoping for updates on companies' investments in the era-defining technology and how they're using it. But trade policy could also get some airtime, especially during Apple’s and Amazon’s calls on Thursday. Microsoft and Meta kick things off with their reports and earnings calls after the closing bell on Wednesday. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) have already turned in results, so after this week the only Magnificent 7 company left to report will be Nvidia (NVDA), in late August. Here are three questions on investors' minds. Six months ago, one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street was whether U.S. tech companies were spending too much on artificial intelligence. That issue appears to be settled—or, at least, on the back burner for now. Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast to $85 billion, citing growing demand for cloud computing products and services; that was generally read as a good thing. Google Cloud grew by more than 30% from the prior year, putting the unit on track to book over $50 billion in revenue within the next year. Cloud computing competitors Microsoft and Amazon could follow Alphabet's lead. Both companies left their capex forecasts unchanged when they reported quarterly results three months ago, decisions that may have been influenced by the trade and economic uncertainty hanging over the market at the time. The companies could be feeling more confident about boosting AI spending now that some of the fog has been lifted by trade agreements. Meta was the odd one out last quarter when it raised its capex outlook. It’s not out of the question that the social media giant will lift its forecast again; it did so in the first and second quarters last year. Investors will be looking for evidence that big investments in AI are paying off. “AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum,” said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. Executives said on the company’s earnings call that Google is monetizing AI search results at about the same rate as it is traditional search, and that AI overviews are driving increased search volume. In recent quarters, Meta has convinced Wall Street that AI is improving ad performance and user engagement. Investors are hoping this week’s results continue to demonstrate that Meta's investments are bearing fruit. Amazon could offer updates on how customers are engaging with Rufus, its AI shopping assistant, and Q, its work assistant. Microsoft is likely to elaborate on the uptake of its Copilot AI offering. As for Apple, experts say, investors may still have to wait for the details they crave. “We don't expect (1) an update on Apple Intelligence timing (2026), (2) any material change in quarterly capex, (3) an update on Apple Intelligence approval in China, and/or (4) any new partnership announcements,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in an earnings preview last week. Management might, however, say product sales grew faster in Apple Intelligence-enabled regions than non-AI regions, he said. At least in the near term, Apple investors are likely more concerned with tariffs than most of its Magnificent Seven counterparts. President Donald Trump in April exempted smartphones and other consumer electronics from his sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, but the president has ordered his administration to consider invoking national security concerns to impose Section 232 duties on smartphones and semiconductors. Section 232 tariffs have held up better in court than Trump’s country-specific duties and could be harder for Apple to avoid. Even with the smartphone exemption, Apple in May estimated tariffs would add $900 million to the company’s costs in the second quarter. Investors will watch for the actual impact and to hear how Apple is engaging with suppliers and the administration to fend off tariffs and mitigate their potential impact. Trade policy will also be top of mind for Amazon investors. In the first quarter, Amazon saw some evidence buyers were stocking up to get ahead of tariffs, which could set the company up for a sequential slowdown in sales. Executives said merchants didn’t meaningfully increase prices in the first quarter, but noted that could change depending on where tariff rates end up.

Middle managers are the talk of corporate America lately — and Business Insider wants to hear about it. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, alongside major retailers like Walmart, are looking for ways to cut costs and streamline bureaucracy. Enter, the Great Flattening: A widespread wipeout of mid-career jobs. Laid-off managers are pushed into a rocky job market, and those who remain employed are left with an increasing number of direct reports. Millennials and Gen X, who hold most of the US' managerial roles, are most impacted. Check out BI's stories about middle managers: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees in June he plans to shrink the company's white-collar workforce, citing "efficiency gains." After a round of layoffs, Dell told BI in March that "Through an ongoing series of actions, we are becoming a leaner company," which will include combining some teams. And, alongside a bout of Meta layoffs in 2023, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that "flatter is faster." "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," he said.

Title: Fast food fixer: 83-year-old Hungry Jack wants a five-minute plan for Domino’s Pizza

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Some Australians might know that the man behind burger chain Hungry Jack’s is Jack Cowin. Another name for him could be Australia’s Burger King, given he owns the local rights to the brand. He has shaped vast swaths of the fast-food landscape, having brought KFC to Australia and being chairman of Domino’s Pizza, in which he is its biggest investor. At 83, with an estimated net worth of $5 billion, you might think the Canadian-born entrepreneur is enjoying retirement. The reality is the opposite. Cowin has taken over chief executive duties at Domino’s following a string of executive exits. The day after the resignation of global chief executive Mark van Dyck (who was seven months into the job) was announced, Cowin hosted a call to field questions from investors and analysts. Make no mistake: Domino’s chairman, now executive chairman, Jack Cowin is calling the shots at the pizza chain.Credit: Dan Peled “This company is not in disarray. The future, in my opinion, is bright,” Cowin declared. “There’s nothing wrong with this base business.” Zooming from his desk in a dark teal jumper, the billionaire businessman conceded a number of key issues that needed to be fixed, picking problems with each departed company chief. He wanted decisions made faster than van Dyck’s plan to do it – in five minutes, preferably, not five years. He also made no secret of his intention to wind back decisions made by van Dyck’s predecessor. “The Don Meij era was growth,” he said. Meij said his reason for leaving was the “sheer intensity” of being at the helm for 22 years. He once topped the charts as the highest-paid ASX chief executive. But under Meij’s watch, Cowin said too many new stores set up in countries such as Luxembourg, France, Japan have been loss-making for too long. “We have to correct that.” From left: Don Meij, Mark van Dyck and Jack Cowin.Credit: Peter Wallis But the conditions for success during that era were some of the best the pizza chain could have wished for. COVID-19 lockdowns keeping everyone at home created huge – but temporary – demand for food delivery. Fast-food customers and investors alike were grabbing a slice of Domino’s, which reached a share price record high of nearly $160 in September 2021. Since then, it hasn’t capitalised on the flash-in-the-pan success. Pizza sales have stalled. Profit predictions were downgraded three times in a year. “It has been this huge growth story for a long time. The last two or three years hasn’t [delivered] any growth,” said Tom Kierath, investment banking firm Barrenjoey’s head of consumer research. Investors fled the stock after van Dyck’s resignation was announced, sending the share price to little over a tenth of that peak to $16.96. Cowin was aware of the need to reassure rattled shareholders, with van Dyck’s departure coming so soon after Meij’s. The billionaire businessman has a personal stake – 25.7 per cent – in fixing this. “The business has got to do better. We’re custodians of other people’s money,” Cowin said. “But to make this business successful, we have to have growth, and we have to do it now rather than on a long-term basis.” Domino’s problems didn’t appear overnight. Many competitive edges that once made it a market leader have eroded over years. Meij sought to make Domino’s website and app best-in-class, spending nearly $23 million in half a year alone on digital platforms. The investment doesn’t appear to have generated high returns. “You had the Peloton bubble, you had the Lululemon bubble with everyone buying casual wear, and we had this Domino’s bubble because they were digitally well advanced beyond anyone else,” said food industry consultant and Titanium Food director Suzee Brain. “That gave them inflated confidence that they were the new flavour of the month. So they started some really massive expansion off the back of a false economy.” The rapid store roll-out across Europe and Asia, once a major sales driver, was reversing. In Australia, Domino’s couldn’t keep the sales spurt they enjoyed during the pandemic. Executive chairman Jack Cowin is unwinding a number of investments decisions made by former CEO Don Meij.Credit: Jamila Toderas “They weren’t able to keep a lot of those customers, because there’s another problem: the product is not all that great,” said Brain. “They’ve never marketed it because they make great pizza … But now, it actually needs to be about the pizza.” Domino’s is facing a more competitive and diverse fast-food landscape in which players such as Guzman y Gomez and El Jannah are attracting younger customers and US chains Five Guys and Wingstop are keen for their slice of the market. As Australia’s dominant pizza chain, industry watchers believe Domino’s must advocate more effectively for the entire pizza category. “As part of your ‘what we do for the kids for a family eating Sunday evening dinner’ [considerations], does Domino’s become part of the conversation more than it currently is? That’s the opportunity,” said one industry analyst who declined to be named. The business must become more profitable, Cowin has told investors. Ideally, this would happen through a sales uplift, but as there’s no guarantee of that, costs need to be pulled out of the business. As delivery aggregators Uber Eats and DoorDash eat Domino’s lunch, IT spending has been an early target. “Our technology is not any better than Uber’s and the other people that we have to deal with,” said Cowin. “If you don’t have a competitive advantage, let’s stop trying to recreate the wheel.” Franchisee profitability is a key priority for Domino’s, with weekly store sales ranging from $30,000 to $100,000, Cowin revealed. But margins were eroded by the spurt of high inflation across ingredients such as cheese as well as wages, fuel and electricity. Meij tried to pass this on by imposing a 6 per cent delivery fee, which backfired with customers who punished the move by buying fewer pizzas. “Relative price point becomes very important,” said Ten Cap co-founder and lead portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu. “This price increase for the fast-food category was just so wrong.” Several fund managers, stock pickers and analysts believe at least some dead weight needs to be shed. Domino’s should sell France and exit Japan, said outspoken stockbroker Angus Aitken. Barrenjoey’s Keirath agrees. “If they get Taiwan, right, is it going to move the dial? No, it’s becoming a distraction. The same in Malaysia,” he said. “What you do by staying in those markets is you dilute the core markets.” Recruitment is under way for Van Dyck’s replacement. But they will have to be someone who will have to play by the rules laid out by Cowin, who has made it clear he wants to see rapid change. “If you have a strong chair in place [who has] already said to the market, ‘well, that guy is not there because he’s not delivering on costs’, then the next person has to subscribe to that view,” said Ten Cap’s Liu. “When you have to focus on costs, you got to be a tough person. You can’t be a nice guy.” There are plenty who think Domino’s is still a good deal, such as Morningstar equity analyst Johannes Faul, who said the leadership instability has injected uncertainty in the short term but described the pizza chain as “a robust brand of the future”. “We do think Domino’s still has growth ahead of it. Quite significantly so,” Faul said. Aitken said there was still a “huge mass market” for Domino’s products. “The demise of Domino’s as a product is not apparent to us,” he said. “We think backing the No.1 [quick-service restaurant] money-maker over 50 years, when he has no friends, is a great time to back Jack Cowin and Domino’s.” Turning things around could take three years. “Jack might be in his 80s but he is hands-on and can fix this with the right team.” The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Title: If Trump Fires Powell, You’ll Want Own This 8.4% Dividend

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 02: (L to R) U.S. President Donald Trump looks on as his nominee for the ... More chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell takes to the podium during a press event in the Rose Garden at the White House, November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. Current Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's term expires in February. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Fire Powell? Keep him around? The question never seems to go away—and the markets, fueled by the so-called “TACO” trade (“Trump always chickens out,” as the acronym goes), are shrugging it all off. But what if Trump calls Wall Street’s bluff? Luckily, there are not one but three ways for us to hedge ourselves from the “TACO trade” going cold. Below, we’ll look at all three and I’ll name my favorite of this trio. Plus we’ll grab ourselves tidy dividends of 7%+, too. If you’re experiencing déjà vu, it’s because this same story happened back in April, and it sent stocks plunging back then. This latest time, however, it’s had little impact at all. But why would stocks sell off based on Powell’s firing in the first place? It’s because of the Federal Reserve’s independence. Its operation of the country’s banking and financial system without intervention from the executive branch has been a mainstay since the central bank’s creation a century ago. And Wall Street wants things to stay that way. So, can we march forward into the future without worrying that Powell will be replaced and a new Fed chair will be inserted who bows to political pressure? This, after all, could increase the odds that interest rates will be cut too much—as low rates are popular—potentially goosing inflation in the process. In the long term, yes—the chances of a “new normal,” where the Fed just does what the president says, are basically zero. But in the short term, a selloff driven by this risk is a distinct possibility. That’s because, over the last few weeks, markets have become increasingly complacent, and stocks have gone from volatile to solidly positive. As I write this, the S&P 500 is up 7.8% for 2025, which is about where it should be, in my view. And I expect it to end 2025 higher still. But the VIX, the market’s “fear gauge,” soared in April, slowly fell back down, and is now a bit lower than where it started the year. In other words, the markets are now saying that stocks are less risky than they were at the start of 2025—even after all the talk about tariffs firing Powell, neither of which have fully gone away. Why? Because now the markets are banking on the TACO trade: If Trump keeps “chickening out,” as the acronym goes, he can be easily ignored. However, this is, paradoxically, a risk. Whatever your politics, it’s undeniable that Trump follows the equity markets and responds to them. Stocks recovered only after Trump backed off on the tariffs in April, which he did only after stocks fell. Stock market performance clearly matters a lot to Trump. As a result, we’re in a weird situation where a continued stock rally could encourage Trump to reverse moves that caused the market to tumble in the past. That would likely cause another drop, which could then prompt Trump to reverse course. As of now, stocks are simply jumping to the last step, rising on the assumption Trump will always back off. Which, ironically, gives him exactly the room he needs to do things that will cause stocks to fall, like firing Powell, for example. It’s all a bit exhausting! But this is where those funds I mentioned earlier come in. Right now, volatility itself is low, and that means any kind of “insurance” on the market hitting another storm is cheaper than normal. The “insurance” I want to tell you about today comes in the form of closed-end funds (CEFs) that buy or sell options on the stocks they hold. Under this strategy, these funds charge a fee, called a “premium,” to option traders for the right to buy the stocks in their portfolios at a fixed date and price in the future. They then use the premiums they collect to fund their dividends, which, as we’ll see shortly, are well north of 7%. This strategy works best in volatile markets—which means today’s lower volatility has put many of our favorite covered-call funds on sale. The three “go-to” covered-call CEFs out there are the Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), which, as the name says, holds the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average; the S&P 500–focused Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX); and the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Between them, they provide broad exposure to the biggest companies in America, like Visa (V), Amazon.com (AMZN) and NVIDIA (NVDA). In other words, many of the same names you’d get if you bought an index fund. But with this trio, we’re getting much higher yields than any index fund pays. And second, unlike ETFs, CEFs (including these three) can trade at a “discount to NAV,” or net asset value. That’s another way of saying we can buy shares of their portfolios for less than they’re actually worth. Covered Call CEFs QQQX tends to be my favorite of these because it often yields the most and has the highest discount. But right now, it yields essentially the same as DIAX, while DIAX offers a much wider discount. That makes DIAX the best buy of the lot today. SPXX, with its 7.5% yield, isn’t generous enough with its dividend, and its discount of 1.3% is almost nonexistent. So if you want to stay in stocks (or stock-focused funds—which we do!) and hedge for future volatility, DIAX is the way to go. Consider also this chart. DIAX Lags On a NAV basis (or going by the performance of its underlying portfolio), DIAX (in purple above) was pretty closely matching its underlying Dow Jones Industrial Average index (in orange) until late April, when a sudden drop in volatility caused DIAX’s portfolio to underperform, and its underperformance has widened since. That’s an opportunity for a contrarian pickup, especially given the fund’s unusually large discount. DIAX Discount to NAV Back in 2022, when volatility was peaking, DIAX saw a flurry of demand. But as stocks have recovered, more money has flowed to alternatives, setting this fund’s discount roughly between 11% and 13%, where it’s been for over a year now. That’s unusual for DIAX, whose average discount has been 6.7% over the last decade. That makes DIAX a timely contrarian play on a rise in volatility, since its covered-call strategy makes it rise as markets get more skittish—and investors look for more “insurance” from the next big plunge.

Title: Largest Bank in Billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio To Deploy $40,000,000,000 in Excess Capital to Shareholders

Bank of America (BAC) says it has just approved a new multi-billion-dollar stock-buyback program. In a new announcement, the largest bank stock in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio says its board of directors has approved a $40 billion common stock repurchase program that goes into effect on August 1st. A stock buyback is when a company buys shares of its own stock, reducing the total number of outstanding shares, according to Bankrate. Buybacks are seen as a way to increase value for investors. Says Bank of America, “[Wednesday’s] authorization will continue providing additional capital return flexibility, reflecting the company’s commitment to return to shareholders excess capital that is not needed to support economic growth, deliver for customers and communities, invest in the future and sustain strength and stability through the economic cycle.” The new program replaces the existing program, which had $9.1 billion in common stock repurchases remaining. Bank of America also announced a dividend increase of $0.02 from the prior quarter, for a total of $0.28 per share. The dividend is payable on September 26th to shareholders of record as of September 5th. Bank of America has a market cap of $360.3 billion and is trading for $48.45 per share at time of writing. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 631.57 million shares of Bank of America, its fourth most valuable holding, behind Apple, American Express and Coca Cola.
