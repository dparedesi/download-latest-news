Activate your online access Opposition to the status quo must not be monopolized by the right-wing extremist visions of parties like Alternative für Deutschland. This week we saw the electoral consequences of a failed economic paradigm: The parties comprising the market fundamentalist conservatives and right-wingers achieved a landslide victory in Germany. The CDU/CSU, led by the former head of Blackrock Germany, Friedrich Merz, won 28.5 percent of the vote and the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the far-right party of former Goldman Sachs banker, Alice Weidel, won 20.8 percent. What had started as Germany’s “progress coalition” of social democrats, greens, and liberals failed. There were two key turning points: In 2022, the energy crisis in the wake of the Ukraine war hit the country hard, and free-market dogmatism delayed the response to price explosions. In 2023, economists who had long argued that markets were perfectly capable of handling the energy crisis and no major government measures were needed proclaimed that there was “not even a recession.” Without an emergency situation, it appeared as if there was no need to suspend the debt brake, a stringent fiscal rule that tied the government’s hands. Germany did enter a recession, and the economic crisis ultimately brought down the government. The reasons behind this result? A loss of confidence in the government, a bitter migration debate, the loss of real wages in recent years, and an ongoing economic crisis. In particular, frustration with economic conditions strengthened the far-right AfD. Because when the economic pie starts shrinking, the struggles over how to divide it escalate. For example, 37 percent of AfD voters and 18 percent of CDU/CSU voters assessed their own economic situation as poor. Tellingly, voters of left-wing and left-liberal parties are significantly less concerned about their economic situation. Even more serious: 85 percent of AfD voters believe that things are not fair in Germany. The overall economic situation was also considered poor by 96 percent of AfD voters and 90 percent of CDU/CSU voters. Here, too, the figures are significantly higher than for the other parties. The AfD has managed to position itself as an alternative to the status quo for those who fear for their economic situation, even though its program amounts to a redistribution from bottom to top. The message is clear: The worse people’s economic situation and prospects, the easier it is for right-wingers to exploit their discontent for their own ends. The current situation, however, should not come as a surprise. Elections in Europe, the United States, and in the German federal states showed this trend months ago, and polls pointed to these developments years ago. The AfD achieved its first surge to 15 percent of the vote in fall 2022 as a result of the energy price shock. The second surge to over 20 percent came in fall 2022, as the price shock deepened and the government briefly considered passing the costs of the crisis on to citizens via the gas levy. As in the US election, the latest surveys of AfD voters also confirm the central role of inflation: Around three-quarters are worried that they will no longer be able to pay their bills due to high prices, that they will not be able to maintain their standard of living, and that they will have money worries in old age. Since Fordism—when production was increasingly broken into a series of simple, repetitive operations—capitalist societies in the Global North have been based on a fundamental social contract. People work hard and are paid enough to afford the necessities of life. When people continue to work hard, but the prices of essential goods skyrocket, workers feel betrayed. Their frustration is exacerbated when stock markets reach record highs and corporate profits skyrocket. What is needed is anti-fascist economic policy—an economic policy that offers a solution to socioeconomic decline and can ease people’s fears about the future. We need a concrete, democratic alternative to the status quo. As first steps, this means a policy that stabilizes essential prices—from food to energy to rent—and a policy that increases wages. Not only in the short term, but also for the future. Examples from Spain and Mexico show us that not only is this essential but also feasible. In Germany, however, the situation threatens to get worse. Under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, prices could rise even further. With extensive tax cuts planned for the richest, a higher VAT could be introduced to offset the costs. Before the election, Merz pointedly refused to rule this out. In addition, Merz is pursuing a radical emissions trading scheme that could lead to another energy price shock in the next few years. The overall economic outlook is disastrous as well, since Merz is committed to austerity. This makes the German economy, and German industry especially, vulnerable to economic shocks, which could be triggered, for example, by an intensifying climate crisis or the tariffs announced by the Trump administration. Although Merz benefited from the poor economic situation in this election, his neoliberal economic turnaround could lead to the implosion of the CDU in the next election. This is also the openly communicated goal of the AfD. They want to replace the CDU as the far-right people’s party, and they are betting, rightly in my opinion, that the CDU will not solve the economic crisis. I believe that neoliberal politics will lead to a further fall in living standards and fraying of the social fabric. This means that in 2029 there is a real threat that a far-right party will be a part of the government in Germany. It is therefore even more important that civil society, trade unions, and progressives within and outside parliament stand up to market fundamentalism—at the very least, by fending off the harshest austerity policies, such as an increase in VAT, and at best, by achieving real policy victories, such as a rent freeze. For an anti-fascist economic policy to counteract the rise of the AfD, it is also essential to present clear policy solutions that make a better future conceivable. Opposition to the status quo must not be monopolized by the right-wing extremist visions of the AfD. Progressives must address people’s existing concerns and the major challenges of our time simultaneously and comprehensively. A new climate populism must play just as much a role in this as a sustainable industrial policy, fair taxation, and an investment program for public infrastructure. The debt brake needs to be reformed, but if it is reduced to ramp up military spending while bridges, hospitals, and schools continue to crumble, it will only play into the hands of the AfD. Germany has enormous fiscal leeway, which must be used to pave the way out of the current plight. This election result should serve as a warning, not just to Germany but to democratic societies around the world. We need to abandon market fundamentalism and muster the courage to design an economy that serves the needs of the general population—not as a side effect but as the primary goal. Democracy cannot be preserved by only discussing how to save it. It can only be secured by policies that guarantee a good life for all. Isabella M.

Title: Spiritans accused of two-tier approach to redress for sex abuse cases

A group representing survivors of child sexual abuse at Spiritan schools has called on the congregation to implement a redress scheme no later than June 1st this year. Restore Together said that, while it welcomes reports that the Spiritans have been making legal settlements with survivors who had taken court action, it did not believe any survivor should have to issue legal proceedings to obtain justice. “Child welfare and trauma experts agree that having to bring legal proceedings to seek justice adds to the suffering of victims/survivors, many of whom are very vulnerable,” it said. As reported in The Irish Times on Wednesday, the Spiritans have paid €8.8 million in settlements to 125 abuse survivors who initiated court proceedings against the congregation. The figure does not include legal costs. Of that figure, €3.4 million was paid in settlements to 52 survivors of 58 who have come forward since RTÉ broadcast its Blackrock Boys radio documentary in November 2022. Between 1998 and prior to that broadcast in November 2022, the congregation paid €5.4 million in settlements to 73 survivors. To date Restore Together has supported over 300 survivors of sexual abuse at Spiritan schools and has been working with the congregation “to bring healing to those who suffered as children and continue to suffer as adults through a professionally guided and administered programme of restorative justice.” In a statement on Friday, it accused the Spiritans of operating a two-tier system when it came to redress. It was “not acceptable” that the congregation was “treating victims/ survivors who issue legal proceedings against them with greater urgency than the many who wish, in good faith and for good reason, to obtain financial recognition for the harm done to them through a redress scheme that the order has agreed to in principle,” it said. It also added that “financial awards under the redress scheme should be at the same value that a court would award to a successful claimant”. The Spiritans in Ireland had “very significant assets which it has valued at €160 million in its accounts. This is multiple times the amount that would be needed to fully implement a redress scheme,” Restore Together said. Spiritan schools concerned are Blackrock College and Willow Park; St Mary’s College, Rathmines; St Michael’s College, Ballsbridge; Templeogue College, in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The congregation had agreed to a redress scheme “in principle, as one of five pillars of its restorative justice programme” and that there have been detailed discussions “with the Spiritans and their lawyers about its structure, nature and implementation,” Restore Together said. It had “repeatedly emphasised” to the Spiritans “the urgency of providing redress to victims to help with their healing. Every week that goes by without a redress scheme being in place prolongs the suffering, and in some cases despair, of victims/survivors who have come forward in good faith having carried their burden for decades through their lives.” Ongoing delay “repeats and continues the sense of betrayal and abandonment first felt by victims/survivors as innocent children” while “many victims/survivors are now in the later stage of life and should not have to wait any longer for proper recognition by the Spiritans of their failure to protect the children in their care or wait for the justice to which they are entitled,” it said. The Spiritans own “principles and Christian teachings” required them “to show true repentance and to fully atone for what they as a congregation did to these vulnerable children,” it said.

Title: Investors Are Making Big AI-Based Sentiment Bets

INDIA - 2023/02/17: In this photo illustration, the logo of Amazon is seen displayed on a mobile ... [+] phone screen with AI (artificial intelligence) written in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) There are indications that AI-enthusiasm is leading current stock market valuations to be driven by sentiment, the psychological biases of excessive optimism and overconfidence, rather than by fundamentals. Four of the largest U.S. companies engaged in AI have announced plans to increase their capital investment by 45%, a testament to their great optimism for the technology. The four companies are Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta. Of these, Amazon’s share of the planned increase in capex is the largest, at almost one third. At the same time, U.S. stocks have held fairly steady, although the S&P 500 has declined by about 3% since the January 20 inauguration of President Trump. The case of Amazon provides a good vehicle for assessing the degree to which stock prices reflect psychological biases rather than underlying fundamentals. The fundamental value of the company as a whole is based on the amount of cash a company generates during a period of time which is available to be paid to both the company’s debtholders and shareholders. The fundamental value of the company’s stock is determined by the portion of these flows that can be paid just to the shareholders. A minority of sell-side analysts use free cash flow analysis to value Amazon’s stocks. Analysts at the former Credit Suisse, now part of UBS, are among this minority. The history of their past reports, as well as their recent reports, provides important insights into the degree to which Amazon’s current stock market valuation accurately reflects fundamentals. On February 27, 2025, Amazon’s stock price closed at just under $210. The analyst team at UBS following Amazon set a target price of $230 for the stock. In October 2019, the team with the same lead analyst, Stephen Ju, established 2025 as the terminal year of their free cash flow analysis. In doing so, they divided their valuation number for Amazon’s stock into two components, one for the five-year period 2020 through 2024, and the other for 2025 and thereafter. A point very important for readers to understand is that for Amazon’s stock, the analyst team assigned about 80% of the stock’s value to the period beginning in 2025. As a result, it is long-term issues that mostly drive the fundamental value of Amazon’s stock, not the short-term, day-to-day fluctuations upon which investors mostly focus. The significance of the long-term approach provides the reason why discussions about capex are critical, as these expenditures significantly impact long-term free cash flows. Market psychology determines the degree to which the stock market is rational. Psychology impacts analysts’ estimates of free cash flows and it impacts investors’ reactions to market events. In a rational world, if analysts’ forecasts of future free cash flows turn out be reasonably accurate, then there is reason to judge that their valuation estimates would be relatively unbiased. Consider two questions. In October 2019, how accurate was the UBS analyst team in forecasting Amazon’s free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024? How accurate was the team in forecasting what Amazon’s market capitalization would be at the beginning of 2025? Based on my analysis of the UBS analyst report and Amazon’s financial statements, it appears that the UBS team significantly overestimated Amazon’s free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024. The ratio of the average annual free cash flow forecast to its actual value was four, an optimistic bias of 300%. This implies that had the analyst team used the actual free cash flow values for their 2019 valuation computation, their target price would have been 25% of the figure in their actual report. The analyst team’s calculations from 2019 provide an estimate of what the value of Amazon’s stock would be at the beginning of 2025. The ratio of the actual value to the estimated value is 1.63, which means that the current market value of Amazon’s stock is 63% higher than what the analyst calculations from 2019 implied. Juxtapose the answers to the two questions. The UBS team severely overestimated by 300% Amazon’s free cash flows, and intrinsic value, during the period 2020 through 2024; and yet Amazon’s stock price is 63% above UBS’ valuation estimate from 2019. In a rational market, this would be very surprising. However, the evidence suggests that the market is far from rational, and this is the point. An important reason why the analyst team overestimated Amazon’s free cash flows for the period beginning in 2020 is that they underestimated Amazon’s capex. This, they did, to the point of assuming that Amazon’s property, plant, and equipment would decline from one year to the next, eventually approaching zero. The assumption of declining PP&E is unrealistic for a company like Amazon, and has no precedent in Amazon’s history. It stands completely opposite to Amazon’s stated investment policy at the time, and certainly to Amazon’s massive planned investment described above. Why the analyst team would make such an assumption is a matter of speculation. One thing to keep in mind is that for a given level of cash flow from operations, lower capex implies higher free cash flows. Therefore, lower capex, all else being the same, leads to a higher valuation. If the analyst team was looking for a way to construct the numbers to produce a higher valuation, this was a way to do it. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the balance sheet the analyst team presents in their 2019 report omits values for the line item PP&E. Indeed, it is the only line item in the balance sheet with blank entries. Therefore, investors interested in the analyst team’s forecast for PP&E would have to compute the numbers themselves, which is what I did. For the record, consider the following fact. Suppose that in 2019, the analyst team used the actual figures for free cash flows to forecast the intrinsic value of Amazon stock at the outset of 2025. Then they would have arrived at a figure that is one ninth of Amazon’s actual market cap. The difference between Amazon’s market cap and the estimate of fundamental value based on actual free cash flows is important. This difference is an indication of just how much bias there is in current market valuations for tech stocks, especially for companies making large AI-related capital expenditures. In 2017, the prices of technology stocks began to increase dramatically, reflecting a discernable change in investor excitement about technology. That year Greg Ip, now the chief economics commentator for The Wall Street Journal, created a video entitled “The Economy Needs More Amazons.” The website description of the video states the following: “The U.S. has observed a long period of low stock-market volatility and economic stagnation. The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip believes the economy and markets could benefit from more risk-taking companies - creative disrupters like Amazon.com.” Amazon is a good company. For psychological reasons, investors exhibit a behavior pattern known as representativeness bias by assuming that good stocks are stocks of good companies. However, irrational exuberance can leads stocks of good companies to be bad stocks. Over the last five years, Amazon has been a good stock, returning 17% per year on average. The point to keep in mind is that this performance has not been generated by Amazon’s free cash flows, the basis of its fundamental value. Instead, it has been generated by investor sentiment, the biased response to underlying fundamentals. Remember that the analyst team severely underestimated the rise in price of Amazon’s stock, even as it simultaneously overestimated Amazon’s free cash flow stream. Investing in stocks like Amazon involves bets on future sentiment as well as fundamentals. In a world of very high expectations for AI, and large capital expenditures in developing this technology, investors would do well to understand the extent to which they are relying on sustained and growing optimism to generate attractive returns. Investors should be paying attention to the differences between market caps and corresponding estimates of fundamental value. However, there appears to be little evidence of them doing so.

ANKARA, TURKIYE - MAY 29: In this photo illustration, Broadcom and VMware logos are seen displayed ... [+] on a computer screen in Ankara, Turkiye on May 29, 2024. (Photo by Abdullah Guclu/Anadolu via Getty Images) See More On Trefis.com Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) experienced a 7% decline on Thursday, February 27th, as part of a broader selloff affecting chip stocks. This market reaction followed the release of Nvidia’s earnings report and President Trump’s announcement of increased tariffs on China, as well as the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, set to take effect next week. Separately, Should You Buy Monster Beverage Stock At $55? After its recent fall, AVGO stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $200. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AVGO stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • Broadcom has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.1 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 69.0 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.9 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • Broadcom has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 24.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 44.0% from $36 Bil to $52 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 51.2% to $14 Bil in the most recent quarter from $9.3 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Broadcom's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $15 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 29.1% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Broadcom’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $20 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 38.7% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. • Broadcom's Debt figure was $68 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $925 Bil (as of 2/27/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 6.5% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $9 billion of the $166 billion in Total Assets for Broadcom. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 5.6% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AVGO stock fell 34.8% from a high of $62.71 on 4 January 2022 to $40.86 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 May 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $249.33 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $200 • AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $27.40 on 19 February 2020 to $14.57 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Very Strong • Financial Stability: Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AVGO is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Market heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) delivered blockbuster results in Q4 of its fiscal year ended January 2025, which saw revenue soar to a record $39.3 billion, up 12% sequentially and 78% year-over-year. The artificial intelligence chip leader posted $0.89 of EPS in the period, up 71% year-over-year, as the company capitalized on accelerating demand for AI-driven computing, particularly for its Blackwell AI platform, which contributed billions in its first quarter of sales. Data Center revenue hit a record $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year and 16% sequentially, fueled by hyperscaler adoption and rapid deployment of Nvidia’s GB200 systems across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Meanwhile, the gaming segment softened, with revenue of $2.5 billion reflecting a 22% decline sequentially and an 11% drop year-over-year, though management remains optimistic about AI-driven gaming innovations. Looking ahead, NVDA expects Q1 fiscal year 26 revenue of approximately $43 billion, representing continued momentum despite expectations for lower gross margins of around 70.6% (GAAP) and 71.0% (non-GAAP). The company remains aggressive in its expansion, recently announcing partnerships with Verizon for AI-powered 5G, collaborations with biotech leaders in healthcare AI, and its first R&D center in Vietnam. Analysts are projecting fantastic bottom-line growth, with the consensus FY 2026 (ends January 2026) EPS estimate now residing at $4.54, up from $2.99 in FY 2025. Further, the projections for FY 2027 and FY 2028 presently stand at $5.70 and $6.46, respectively. No doubt, the growth rates Nvidia has been able to achieve are nothing short of remarkable, underpinned by revolutionary achievements in chip design. Still, even after an 8% post-earnings whack to the stock price, the market capitalization stands at $3 trillion, meaning the law of large numbers should give investors pause. After all, the more-than-$250-billion market-cap hit for NVDA on February 27 was larger in size than the entire market cap of household names like McDonald’s, American Express and Walt Disney. That is not to say that I think NVDA is trading at a ridiculous valuation, as was the case for many profitless stocks during the 2000 Tech Bubble. Still, a forward P/E ratio of 27, a price-to-sales ratio of 22.5 and a price-to-book value ratio of 37 make the stock too expensively valued for my taste, as such a lofty price raises concerns about whether the growth trajectory can match (or dare I say outpace) current market expectations. Indeed, I would bet that if someone had the Q4 results and guidance ahead of time, he or she would have been buyers of NVDA as the numbers were spectacular. While demand for AI infrastructure remains robust, much of the company’s explosive growth has been priced into the stock, leaving little margin for error. Any slowdown in data center spending, increased competition from AMD and others, and potential custom AI chips developed by cloud giants, not to mention macroeconomic headwinds, could pressure margins and dampen investor enthusiasm. Certainly, I am keeping a watchful eye on NVDA and a double-digit share price could have me singing a different tune about the stock, especially as I think AI will be a major growth story for years to come. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the transformative impact of AI on global industries, stating, “The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning. With reasoning AI, we’re observing another scaling law, inference time or test-time scaling. The more computation, the more the model thinks, the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAIs, Grok-3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute." For investors looking to gain exposure to AI without the premium valuation of Nvidia, I highlighted more than a dozen stocks in my latest Special Report. Investment Insight: Decoding AI and Generating Investment Ideas Nvidia’s AI-fueled data center boom has turned into a gusher for the semiconductor supply chain, offering tremendous opportunity for Lam Research (LRCX). The company makes the high-tech picks and shovels—etch and deposition tools—needed to churn out high-bandwidth memory and advanced logic chips, both of which are in hot demand as AI workloads get more power-hungry. With memory giants like Samsung and SK Hynix cranking up production to keep pace with Nvidia’s Blackwell ramp, Lam is sitting in the catbird seat. As long as AI keeps gobbling up ever-more data and demanding ever-faster chips, I think Lam’s business will hum along just fine, making it another smart way to hitch a ride on the AI train at a more reasonable price tag. And LRCX even comes with a modest 1.2% current dividend yield.

Title: Real-World Assets – The $56 Billion Frontier

Time Published: 2025-02-28T04:40:38Z
Full Content:
The tokenization of RWAs (real-world assets) stands at an inflection point, with the market reaching $56 billion and poised for explosive growth. While skeptics have long criticized cryptocurrency’s lack of intrinsic value, RWA platforms fundamentally reshape this narrative by bringing tangible assets – from real estate to equities – onto the blockchain. Four key players exemplify the sector’s maturation and growing institutional adoption. Their success underscores a crucial reality – RWA operates as a complex two-sided marketplace, requiring both willing asset owners and sophisticated investors. As Wall Street takes interest, a new batch of regulations that nurture the burgeoning sector is crucial for long-term growth. Pendle Pendle offers perhaps the most innovative approach to yield-bearing assets. Unlike traditional products where ownership and yield are inseparable, Pendle’s model allows separate trading of PT (principal tokens) and YT (yield tokens). This flexibility has driven their total value locked to $5.9 billion, five times larger than that of their nearest competitor. Their fixed yields for popular products reach as high as 14.7% for USDe, attracting investors seeking stable returns in volatile markets. Ethena Ethena’s trajectory demonstrates the critical role of venture capital in shaping the RWA landscape. Following a $14 million Series A round that attracted investments from Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, they’ve secured strategic partnerships with World Liberty Financial and Deribit. Their synthetic dollar, sUSDe, offering a six percent APY, represents a new generation of yield-bearing assets designed for institutional adoption. Ondo Ondo Finance exemplifies the sector’s push toward mainstream integration. Through partnerships with BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, they’ve launched tokenized versions of blue-chip stocks and ETFs, including Coca-Cola (onKO) and SPDR Gold Shares (onGLD). Their recent announcement of Ondo Chain – purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs – signals growing confidence in the sector’s future. What makes these developments particularly significant is their timing. As retail investors grow increasingly sophisticated and demand more stable investment vehicles, RWA platforms offer a compelling solution. When the average US home price stands at $356,585, fractional ownership through tokenization democratizes access to previously exclusive asset classes. The regulatory environment appears increasingly supportive – particularly in the US – where stablecoin legislation is gaining momentum. This could provide a substantial boost to yield-bearing assets like Ondo’s USDY, currently unavailable to US investors. Wall Street’s latest (and biggest?) bet The RWA transformation extends beyond traditional finance – innovative projects are exploring tokenization of everything from aviation financing to electric motorcycle fleets, demonstrating the versatility of RWA platforms. However, challenges remain. The sector must navigate complex regulatory requirements, ensure robust security measures and build sufficient liquidity across various asset classes. Success requires substantial capital – evidenced by the aggressive fundraising among leading platforms – to secure regulatory approvals and build institutional-grade infrastructure. Even with these challenges, traditional financial institutions are taking notice. The involvement of firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Fidelity isn’t merely symbolic – it represents a fundamental shift in how Wall Street views digital assets. These partnerships provide crucial infrastructure and credibility, helping bridge the gap between traditional and DeFi (decentralized finance). Yet the trajectory is clear. RWA tokenization represents more than just another blockchain use case – it’s a fundamental reimagining of how we interact with traditional assets. By breaking down barriers to investment and creating more efficient markets, these platforms are driving what may be the most profound cultural and economic impact within the crypto space. As we move through 2025, the question isn’t whether RWA will transform finance, but rather which platforms will emerge as the dominant players in this new paradigm. For investors and institutions alike, understanding this evolution isn’t just advantageous – it’s essential. The next phase of growth will likely come from increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and innovative applications that push the boundaries of what can be tokenized.

This is the second-best February performance in a decade. While overall growth is moderate, the market remains stable. February being a shorter month also impacted the sales data. Mumbai’s property market is well positioned for long-term stability and growth. Large-scale infrastructure projects and a redevelopment boom, coupled with a strong economic outlook, are boosting the market. The broader outlook for the real estate sector remains resilient. The full impact of the RBI rate cut, tax cuts in the budget, and liquidity measures announced by the RBI is expected to provide much-needed support by increasing affordability for buyers, ensuring market stability is maintained. We continue to believe that the demand for homes developed by reputed developers in township and gated communities will command a premium and renewed demand.” Post Covid Nifty has seen 14-15% PE or Price compression.

The latest government data reveals that over 11,300 homes were sold in Mumbai in February 2025. This translates to over 400 units sold per day, a phenomenal achievement. This is positive news for the real estate sector, indicating a growing interest in homes in the city. We expect the positive trend to continue and witness an upward trajectory. Firstly, the full impact of RBI’s rate cut and measures announced in the Union Budget will be seen in the months to come. Developers offering various lucrative schemes and incentives to attract buyers will boost sales. Additionally, there is a demand for both premium and mid-end categories, particularly in emerging micro-markets. The heightened traction in the redevelopment will increase inventory and a wider choice for homebuyers. We expect the broader economic recovery to benefit the housing industry Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd. (ACMIIL) presents the latest January 2025 Credit Card Market Report, offering a deep dive into spending trends, card issuance patterns, and competitive market dynamics. Key Market Insights: 1. Credit Card Spending Shows Seasonal Decline but Strong YoY Growth Total credit card spending stood at ₹1.8 trillion, reflecting a 2% month-on-month (MoM) decline but a robust 14% year-on-year (YoY) growth. The MoM decline is attributed to a high base effect from December 2024, when festive and holiday-related spending boosted transaction volumes. The average spend per card dipped 1% MoM to ₹16,911, while the average spend per transaction declined 1% MoM and 15% YoY to ₹4,282, indicating evolving consumer behaviour and macroeconomic adjustments. 2. Credit Card Transactions & Issuance Witness a Slowdown Total transaction volume reached 430 million, a 1% MoM decline but still 31% higher YoY. However, this marks the slowest YoY growth since March 2024, reflecting cautious consumer spending. The number of outstanding credit cards declined to 109 million, down from 110 million in December 2024. 1.2 million cards were withdrawn in January, possibly due to tightening credit norms and increased delinquencies. 3. Market Leaders Continue to Strengthen Their Positions HDFC Bank, SBI, and ICICI Bank remain dominant players, collectively maintaining a significant share of the credit card market. HDFC Bank’s market share increased from 20.2% to 21.5% YoY, reflecting strong customer acquisition efforts. SBI recovered from a temporary dip, increasing its share to 18.8%, with 2.4 lakh new cards issued in January. ICICI Bank also regained ground, rising from 16.3% to 16.6% YoY. 4. Midcap and Small-Cap Banks Show Mixed Performance Yes Bank’s market share has remained stagnant at 2.2% since September 2024, signaling a slowdown in its previous aggressive expansion strategy. IDFC First Bank emerged as an outperformer, increasing its market share from 2.4% to 3.1% YoY through an aggressive push in credit card issuance. 5. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Credit Card Embargo Lifted A significant regulatory development in February 2025: The RBI lifted Kotak Mahindra Bank’s 10-month embargo on credit card issuance. This move is expected to help Kotak regain lost market share, which had slipped to 4.6% YoY. The bank’s re-entry is poised to impact competitive market dynamics in the coming months. 6. Disbursement Growth Hits a 4-Year Low The slowdown in credit card disbursement is at a 4-year low, signaling cautious lending practices by banks amid concerns over rising delinquencies and economic uncertainty. The total market share of the top 10 banks remains strong at 92%, showing continued consolidation in the industry. Conclusion & Market Outlook The credit card industry continues to experience strong annual growth, but short-term headwinds remain due to seasonal fluctuations, tightened credit policies, and evolving consumer behavior. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s re-entry and shifts in market share among key players are expected to be key themes in the months ahead. For detailed insights or expert commentary, please feel free to reach out Since the operationalisation of Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), 1.19 lakh projects, comprising 97.14 lakh units, have been registered with top 10 State RERAs between 2017-2024, said a report by NSE-listed data analytics firm PropEquity. The top ten States with the highest number of projects registered with their respective RERAs are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan. Maharashtra with 48,047 registered projects accounts for 40% of the total registered projects in top 10 states. Tamil Nadu with 19987 projects accounts for 17% share while Gujarat with 16,265 projects accounts for 14% share. Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO, PropEquity said: “Due to RERA, there has been a vast improvement in compliance by real estate developers as a result of which the sector has seen huge transparency. This has led to a rise in investment by individual investors, and both domestic and foreign institutional investors thereby further espousing not just India’s but also real estate sector’s growth story.” “The real estate market across 9 top Tier 1 cities are today valued at over Rs 5.5 lakh crore. Unlike the pre-RERA years, absorption every year, post RERA implementation, has been more than launches (except covid year CY 2020), which shows the maturity that this regulation has ushered amongst developers thereby laying a strong foundation for a $1 trillion real estate economy.” “The government must look to align strong regulations and compliance with favourable tax policies for both developers and homebuyers in order to achieve this vision.” The PropEquity report further stated that at 184 units, the average number of units per project is the highest in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Rajasthan at 156 units and Gujarat at 116 units. The average number of units per projects in top 10 states stands at 81 units.

The Outlook is Stable. The rating affirmation reflects our view that the strong balance sheet buffers built by TCL in recent years will support its financial profile through the ongoing period of oversupply in the global soda ash industry, despite weakening EBITDA margins. The rating is also supported by TCL’s strong business profile as one of the world’s largest soda ash producers, its cost competitive and geographically diversified operations, and the industry’s end-market diversification. The Stable Outlook reflects our view that TCL’s EBITDA net leverage will remain commensurate for its rating over the financial years ending March 2025 (FY25)-FY28 Anirit Ventures Ltd, a subsidiary of Oilmax Energy Pvt Ltd, has announced its strategic expansion plans along with appointment of Chief Executive Officer.

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post Germán José Manuel Toro Ghio, son of Germán Alfonso and Jenny Isabel Cristina, became a citizen of planet Earth in the cold dawn of Sunday, May 11, 1958, in Santiago, capital of southern Chile.... Workart fully right of Germán & Co America stands at a fateful energy crossroads, echoing past cycles of crisis and retrenchment. From the 1970s oil shocks that spurred calls for independence to later complacency when oil was cheap, U.S. energy policy has repeatedly swung between urgency and inertia (Browner, 2010). Now climate change amplifies the stakes, making this moment a critical turning point. A new development came on January 20, 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending Inflation Reduction Act funding disbursements—particularly those referred to in Section 2 of the order. Nicknamed “Terminating the Green New Deal,” it also pauses Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act spending, effectively freezing billions allocated for clean energy and manufacturing projects (Magill, 2025). While the White House clarified that only certain segments of the law are affected, federal agencies face a 90-day deadline to review and propose new spending recommendations. One path still doubles down on fossil fuel dominance, promising short-term economic gains and energy security but locking in climate chaos and potential geopolitical liabilities (Reuters, 2024). The other path fully commits to renewable energy, delivering innovation and long-term sustainability. Yet overcoming powerful fossil fuel lobbies and reliance on foreign-made critical minerals remains challenging (Sayki and Cloutier, 2023). The U.S. stands at a high-stakes juncture—continuing the status quo risks climate disaster and missed technological leadership, while bold action could secure economic vitality for generations. Introduction: The United States has long fluctuated between prioritizing traditional energy sources (oil, gas, coal) and renewable energy in its national strategy. These shifts are rarely accidental; they reflect a complex interplay of industry ties, economic factors, and policy preferences among leaders. When policy leans toward traditional fossil fuels, it often correlates with strong lobbying influence and short-term economic arguments, whereas pushes for renewables tend to follow environmental concerns, innovation booms, or global agreements. This analysis examines: (1) historical swings in U.S. energy policy, (2) the economic impacts of fossil fuels vs. renewables (jobs, stability, subsidies), (3) how fossil industry lobbying shapes policy, (4) geopolitical implications of favoring traditional energy (security, trade, diplomacy), and (5) the environmental consequences of pivoting away from renewables. U.S. energy policy has see-sawed over the decades, with periods of innovation and renewable investment often followed by returns to oil, gas, and even coal. Key shifts include: 1970s – Crisis and Alternatives: The 1973 oil embargo and energy crisis jolted policymakers into reducing dependence on foreign oil. The government funded the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, while also investing in renewable fuels and R&D (ethanol, biodiesel, solar, wind) for the first time (Choices Article - Evolution of Renewable Energy Policy). Conservation took hold: Congress enacted fuel economy standards, and Americans embraced energy efficiency, briefly curbing demand growth (Choices Article - Evolution of Renewable Energy Policy). 1980s – Return to Oil: With oil prices stabilizing in the mid-1980s, momentum for renewables waned. Federal tax credits for solar and wind established in the late ‘70s expired, and President Reagan famously removed solar panels from the White House roof, signaling a policy reversion to traditional energy. Domestic oil and gas production and deregulation were again emphasized, while nascent renewable programs stalled (no major new federal mandates in this era). 1990s – Mixed Signals: Low energy prices kept renewables on the policy back-burner for much of the 1990s. However, concerns about energy security resurfaced when global demand pushed oil prices up in the late ‘90s (Choices Article - Evolution of Renewable Energy Policy). The 1992 Energy Policy Act and other laws introduced some incentives for alternative energy (e.g. wind production tax credit in 1992) and required federal fleets to use alternative fuels, but fossil fuels still dominated the agenda. 2000s – Energy Security vs. Climate: The early 2000s saw industry influence at a peak. In 2001, Vice President Dick Cheney’s Energy Task Force—stacked with oil executives—drafted a policy focused on expanding fossil production. (The task force met at least six times with Enron and other energy company executives behind closed doors (Big GOP contributor advised administration's energy task force – Center for Public Integrity), spurring lawsuits over the secrecy and undue influence (Big GOP contributor advised administration's energy task force – Center for Public Integrity).) President George W. Bush, himself from the oil industry, nonetheless supported some renewables for energy security – the 2005 energy law established a renewable fuel standard for ethanol, and his administration promoted biofuels to reduce oil import dependence (Choices Article - Evolution of Renewable Energy Policy). By contrast, states like California began adopting aggressive renewable portfolio standards. Late in the decade, President Obama’s 2009 stimulus injected billions into clean energy and efficiency, marking a strong pivot toward renewables and climate policy (e.g. subsidies for solar, wind, electric vehicles, and the beginnings of EPA carbon regulations). 2010s – Transition and Pushback: Under Obama, the U.S. joined the Paris Climate Agreement and implemented the Clean Power Plan to shift electricity from coal to wind, solar, and gas. Renewable generation surged, while coal plant closures accelerated. However, the 2016 election ushered in a sharp reversal. President Donald Trump made a “America First Energy Plan” to revive coal and expand oil and gas the centerpiece of his agenda. He withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and rolled back Obama-era regulations, justifying a “robust emphasis on fossil fuels” and a scaling back of renewable programs as necessary for lower energy prices and “energy dominance” (Trump has big plans for climate and energy policy, but can he implement them?). This meant more federal land drilling, faster pipeline approvals, and attempts to bail out coal plants. Despite this traditional energy push, market forces (cheap natural gas, falling renewable costs) kept driving a renewables rise through the late 2010s. 2020s – Climate Priorities Return: In 2021, the pendulum swung again. The Biden administration rejoined the Paris accord and passed unprecedented clean energy investments (the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 alone put $369 billion toward clean energy). Even so, debates continue: global events like the 2022 war in Ukraine prompted calls for more U.S. oil and gas production to secure allies’ energy supply, showing the constant tension between short-term energy security goals and long-term climate/renewable goals in U.S. strategy. Economic considerations are central to energy policy decisions. Politicians often weigh the job creation potential, market stability, and subsidies of fossil fuels against those of renewables – and these factors can cut both ways: Jobs and Industry Growth: Traditional energy sectors (oil, gas, coal) have historically been major employers, but clean energy now leads in job creation. By the late 2010s, U.S. clean energy jobs already outnumbered fossil fuel jobs roughly 3-to-1 (). For example, solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians became some of the fastest-growing occupations. One report found over 3.3 million Americans were employed in clean energy (renewables, energy efficiency, electric vehicles) in 2018, far exceeding fossil fuel extraction and generation jobs (). These trends continued into the 2020s as solar and wind capacity expanded. In contrast, coal mining jobs have steadily declined for decades due to automation and competition, and even oil/gas employment can swing with commodity prices. Renewable energy investments tend to produce more jobs per dollar because they are more labor-intensive during construction and installation (e.g. building a wind farm employs many workers even if operating it later is low-labor). This makes the “jobs” argument for shifting back to fossil fuels weaker over time, except in specific regions (e.g. coal country) where fossil jobs are concentrated. Market Stability and Energy Costs: Fossil fuel markets are inherently cyclical and volatile – oil and gas prices boom and bust based on global supply, conflict, and OPEC decisions. This volatility can destabilize the broader economy: in fact, spiking fossil energy prices were responsible for about one-third of the 9.1% U.S. inflation at the peak of 2022 (Fossil Fuel–Driven Price Volatility Demonstrates the Need for a Renewable Transition - Roosevelt Institute). Renewables, by contrast, have stable and declining costs over time (once a solar farm is built, the “fuel” – sunlight – is free). Greater adoption of renewables can insulate the economy from oil price shocks. A recent analysis argues that relying on fossil fuels poses a “persistent threat” to price stability, and that shifting to renewable electricity would help tame long-term inflation fluctuations (Fossil Fuel–Driven Price Volatility Demonstrates the Need for a Renewable Transition - Roosevelt Institute). However, opponents of rapid renewable adoption point out short-term reliability and integration costs – e.g. the need for grid upgrades and storage – which can affect energy prices during the transition. Still, on a per-unit cost basis, wind and solar are now often the cheapest new sources of power in the U.S., even beating natural gas in many regions (especially when volatility is factored in). Government Subsidies and Support: Fossil fuels have enjoyed generous government support for decades, far more than renewables until very recently. Tax breaks and subsidies for oil, gas, and coal date back as far as the early 20th century (and even the 1800s in the case of coal tariffs) A historical review noted that federal support for renewables has been “minimal compared with the past government investment in coal, gas, oil, or nuclear,” which helped those traditional industries grow ([Long-History-US-Energy-Subsidies Even today, the U.S. tax code provides oil and gas producers deductions for drilling costs, depletion allowances, and other incentives that effectively subsidize fossil energy. In addition, external costs like climate change and pollution are not priced into fossil fuels (another implicit subsidy). Renewables also receive subsidies (e.g. federal wind and solar tax credits, state renewable mandates), but these only scaled up significantly in the 2000s-2010s. By the 2020s, federal policy began leveling the field – the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 created long-term tax credits for clean energy worth hundreds of billions, aiming to spur domestic manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, etc. The economic debate often centers on which sector deserves public support: proponents of fossil fuels argue they provide reliable energy and tax revenues, while clean energy advocates note that investment in renewables yields future industries and avoids environmental damages. Notably, studies show renewable investments generate good-paying jobs and innovation without the long-term environmental liabilities of fossil fuels. In summary, short-term economic arguments for sticking with traditional energy (existing jobs, immediate infrastructure) are weighed against long-term gains from the growing, more stable clean energy economy. The trajectory of U.S. energy strategy cannot be understood without acknowledging the power of the fossil fuel lobby. Oil, gas, and coal companies have deep ties in Washington, built over a century of political spending and networking, which they use to shape policy in their favor. Key aspects of this influence include: Lobbying Expenditures and Campaign Funding: The fossil fuel industry is one of the top spenders on lobbying federal officials. In 2022 alone, the U.S. oil and gas industry spent about $124.4 million lobbying Congress and the executive branch (Oil and gas industry spent $124.4 million on federal lobbying amid record profits in 2022 • OpenSecrets). This money funds armies of lobbyists who advocate for permits, tax breaks, and favorable regulations for drilling and mining. Moreover, industry trade groups like the American Petroleum Institute amplify this influence (API spent over $4 million on lobbying in 2022) (Oil and gas industry spent $124.4 million on federal lobbying amid record profits in 2022 • OpenSecrets). The industry also pours tens of millions into campaign contributions, predominantly to politicians who oppose aggressive climate policies. Over the 2000s, fossil-fuel-linked political action committees and donors outspent renewable energy advocates by a wide margin – one analysis found that anti-climate lobby groups and PACs outspent climate advocacy by 27-to-1 from 2008 to 2018 (Oil and gas industry spent $124.4 million on federal lobbying amid record profits in 2022 • OpenSecrets). This financial clout translates to access: lawmakers reliant on campaign funds are more likely to vote against carbon taxes or to support oil subsidies. The result is often policy gridlock or rollback on clean energy initiatives whenever fossil interests are threatened. Revolving Doors and Policy Capture: Beyond money, fossil fuel companies have secured influence by positioning allies in government. It’s common for oil executives and lobbyists to rotate into top energy policy jobs (and vice versa). For example, in the early 2000s, Vice President Cheney (a former oil-services CEO) convened an energy task force that met secretly with industry executives to craft national energy policy (Big GOP contributor advised administration's energy task force – Center for Public Integrity). The task force’s recommendations closely mirrored oil and gas industry wishes, highlighting how direct input from industry insiders can steer policy. More recently, during the Trump administration, several key officials had oil industry ties – from the Secretary of State (ex-ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson) to Interior Department appointees who had worked for extractive industries. These ties often led to regulatory appointments of individuals skeptical of renewable energy or climate science, and decisions like opening more public lands to drilling or weakening methane emission rules. In short, the fossil lobby’s influence permeates all levels: writing legislation, guiding agency rules, and even shaping public narratives (through funding of think tanks and advertising). By contrast, the renewable energy lobby and environmental groups, while growing in influence, have historically had far fewer resources. This imbalance helps explain why U.S. policies have sometimes been slow to embrace renewables despite their technological viability – incumbent industries use political power to delay the transition. Energy policy is not just a domestic issue; it has far-reaching geopolitical effects. Emphasizing traditional fossil fuels in U.S. strategy carries a mix of benefits and risks for national security, global markets, and diplomacy: Energy Security and Independence: A key argument for boosting domestic oil, gas, and coal is to improve U.S. energy security – ensuring the nation isn’t overly reliant on foreign suppliers. In the past 15 years, the U.S. shale revolution dramatically increased domestic production, making the U.S. the world’s largest producer of petroleum and natural gas by the mid-2010s (Geopolitical implications of U.S. oil and gas in the global market). Greater output at home means less dependence on unstable regions: for example, U.S. imports of oil have fallen from over 60% of consumption in 2005 to roughly 25% by 2019. A fossil-focused “energy dominance” strategy leverages this boon – using abundant U.S. oil and gas to supply both domestic needs and allies abroad. Indeed, expanding LNG (liquefied natural gas) exports has given the U.S. a tool to help Europe diversify away from Russian gas. However, true energy independence remains elusive. Even at record production, the U.S. still imports about 10 million barrels of oil per day, and domestic prices are tied to the volatile global market (Geopolitical implications of U.S. oil and gas in the global market). Prioritizing fossil fuels may increase production, but it cannot fully shield the U.S. from global price shocks or supply disruptions (e.g. a war in the Middle East can still send U.S. gasoline prices soaring). By contrast, a more renewable-based system would source energy from domestic wind, sun, and other inexhaustible resources, reducing vulnerability to international supply swings once the infrastructure is in place. In sum, boosting traditional energy offers short-term security via supply abundance, yet it keeps the U.S. tethered to a volatile global fossil market in the long run. Trade Dependencies: The choice between fossil and renewable emphasis also affects trade relationships and dependencies. Relying on oil often entangles the U.S. with petrostates (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Venezuela) to secure supply or stabilize prices. Conversely, pursuing renewables can create new dependencies on clean technology supply chains – notably, minerals and manufacturing dominated by China. For instance, China today accounts for nearly 85% of global solar panel production (Regional distribution of solar module production | Statista) and is a leading supplier of lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and electric vehicles. If the U.S. forgoes investing in renewables now, it might later find itself buying solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries from abroad, ceding industrial leadership to rivals. We already see this in the solar sector: China’s massive scale and control of raw materials have given it a near-monopoly in solar manufacturing. Thus, a fossil-centric path could swap one dependency (oil from OPEC) for another (clean tech hardware from Asia) as the world eventually transitions. From a trade perspective, there is also a risk that U.S. goods could face carbon tariffs in the future from regions like the EU if America is viewed as not doing its share on emissions. On the positive side, maintaining robust oil and gas capacity allows the U.S. to be an energy exporter. In recent years the U.S. became a top LNG exporter, strengthening trade ties with gas-importing allies (Europe, Japan) and undercutting adversaries who use energy as coercion. In summary, geopolitics cuts both ways: traditional energy dominance can bolster U.S. influence in hydrocarbon markets, but a lagging clean tech sector could leave the U.S. dependent on foreign renewable technology in the future. Diplomatic Strategy and Global Leadership: Energy policy sends a powerful signal about U.S. global priorities. Emphasizing fossil fuels domestically often goes hand-in-hand with a retreat from international climate initiatives, which can strain alliances with countries prioritizing climate action. A vivid example was the Trump administration’s decision to quit the Paris Climate Agreement and champion coal at UN climate forums, which isolated the U.S. from European allies and undermined U.S. credibility in global environmental diplomacy (Trump has big plans for climate and energy policy, but can he implement them?). Countries in the EU, as well as emerging powers vulnerable to climate impacts, generally want the U.S. engaged in the clean energy transition. If U.S. policy swings back to traditional energy, it may gain favor with other petro-states (creating closer ties with countries like Saudi Arabia or Russia on energy matters) but at the cost of diplomatic capital with a much larger group of nations committed to carbon reduction. Moreover, climate change is increasingly at the center of international security discussions; a U.S. that downplays renewables may be seen as not leading on one of the defining issues of the century. On the other hand, being a major fossil fuel producer does give the U.S. certain strategic advantages: it can impose oil sanctions on adversaries (as it did on Iran and Venezuela) with less fear of domestic shortages, and it can use energy exports as a foreign policy tool (for instance, offering shipments of LNG to friends in need). Ultimately, prioritizing traditional energy provides short-term geopolitical leverage in a fossil-fuel-driven world, but it runs the risk of diminishing U.S. leadership in the inevitable global shift toward clean energy. Many experts note that the energy transition will redraw geopolitical maps – countries that lead in renewable technologies may gain influence, while those clinging solely to fossil fuels could see their power wane as demand for oil declines in the long run. The U.S. faces a strategic choice in that regard. Perhaps the most profound impact of favoring fossil fuels over renewables is on the environment and climate. The scientific consensus is clear that burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of global climate change, and that a rapid transition to clean energy is needed to avoid catastrophic impacts. The environmental stakes of the policy reversal are high: Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Fossil fuel combustion (for electricity, transportation, and industry) accounts for the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Renewables, by contrast, produce little to no direct emissions. For example, a wind turbine or solar panel emits essentially zero CO₂ in operation, whereas a coal plant releases roughly 1 ton of CO₂ per MWh. If the U.S. slows its renewable energy build-out and burns more coal, oil, and gas, its emissions trajectory will worsen. This would undermine national targets to cut emissions (the U.S. pledged a 50% reduction by 2030 under Paris) and make global climate stabilization harder. Recent progress illustrates the difference policy can make: U.S. energy-related carbon emissions had been declining in part due to coal-to-gas switching and renewable growth (US Energy Policy: A Changing Landscape) (US Energy Policy: A Changing Landscape). But a resurgence of coal use or expanded oil consumption could reverse that decline. In short, shifting away from renewables means higher emissions, jeopardizing climate goals. One analysis projects that if clean energy transition stalls, U.S. emissions would only drop modestly by 2035 – far below what’s needed to limit warming. Beyond CO₂, increased fossil fuel use also elevates emissions of methane (from natural gas systems) and other pollutants. Pollution and Public Health: Traditional fossil fuels have significant environmental footprints beyond climate change. Coal-fired power plants and diesel engines emit pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and mercury, which degrade air quality and cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in the population. Oil drilling and coal mining can contaminate water supplies and destroy natural habitats. A policy shift favoring these sources would extend such impacts. By contrast, renewable energy has a much smaller environmental footprint. As a Department of Energy factsheet notes, the current U.S. fossil-heavy energy mix is linked to issues like acid rain, air pollution, and water contamination, whereas renewables can meet energy demand with far fewer of these side effects (U.S. Renewable Energy Factsheet | Center for Sustainable Systems). In 2018, it was estimated that air pollution from fossil fuels cost the global economy $2.9 trillion in health and environmental damages – costs that would fall dramatically in a cleaner energy scenario. Thus, stepping back from renewables carries an opportunity cost in lost health benefits. Additionally, fossil fuel infrastructure (pipelines, refineries, mines) often impacts vulnerable communities, raising environmental justice concerns if those are expanded. Climate Resilience and Environmental Sustainability: Ironically, doubling down on fossil fuels can make the U.S. less resilient in the face of climate change. As global warming accelerates, extreme weather (hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves) threatens energy infrastructure and reliability. A renewable-based, distributed energy system with energy storage is seen by experts as more adaptable and resilient to such disruptions (for example, rooftop solar with batteries can keep lights on during grid outages). If policy shifts focus back to centralized fossil power plants and a high-carbon system, the U.S. may face greater long-term costs from climate adaptation and disaster recovery. Moreover, the environmental momentum loss is significant: scaling back support for renewables could slow the improvement of technologies like energy storage, smart grids, and electric vehicles – all crucial for sustainability. In contrast, maintaining a renewable trajectory yields positive feedback: as solar, wind, and battery tech improve and scale up, they get cheaper and more efficient, accelerating emissions reductions further. A halt or reversal would delay that virtuous cycle. In summary, the environmental consequences of favoring traditional energy are unequivocally negative: higher greenhouse emissions driving more severe climate change, more air and water pollution harming public health, and a missed chance to mitigate and adapt to climate risks. Every year of delay in the renewable transition locks in additional CO₂ in the atmosphere that will persist for centuries. This is why many scientists and economists argue that the long-term environmental costs of reverting to fossil fuels far outweigh any short-term economic gains. Renewable energy, while not impact-free, offers a path to sustainable growth that fossil fuels simply cannot match in environmental performance (renewables produce far less greenhouse gas and pollution in operation (Environmental Impacts of Renewable Energy Sources | ADEC ESG)).

Before we delve into the core issues, we must recognize a communications software firm in Stockholm. Their digital cluster has been instrumental in conducting rigorous hypothesis testing and minimising biases. This acknowledgement is particularly crucial in today's world, where geopolitical connections are increasingly unusual, disruptive, and strained across two hundred partnerships. Moreover, we find ourselves in an era devoid of clear ideological principles. One prominent thinker, Peter Wason, suggested that what seems illogical can be logical. Given our limited computing resources, the software company's collaborative spirit has been essential in navigating these complexities. Wason's work, particularly the Wason selection task, highlighted: ¨how human reasoning can often be counterintuitive and influenced by context, showing that logical structures can appear illogical depending on their presentation... At the break of dawn, Spanish newspapers with global reach announced the passing of Mexican singer Francisca Viveros Barradas, known as Paquita la del Barrio, at the age of 77. Her powerful contralto voice, rebellious persona, and extraordinary ability to channel the depths of heartbreak made her a beacon of what could be called a culture of heartache and disillusionment. Through fiery lyrics of betrayal, confusion, and sorrow—forever immortalized in the now-iconic phrase “¿Me estás oyendo, inútil?” (“Are you listening to me, you useless man?”)—Paquita gave voice to those who felt wronged or discarded. Her song “Rata de dos patas,” composed by Manuel Eduardo Toscano and featured on the 2001 album ¨Taco Placero¨, transcended Mexican cantinas, becoming an anthem of empowerment and emotional catharsis worldwide. Connecting such intensely personal themes to broader global affairs may seem unlikely. Yet, Paquita’s raw, impassioned ballads resonate in a world grappling with profound upheaval—where betrayal and shattered trust extend beyond the personal realm to societal and political dimensions. In hidden corners of large cities, amid bustling avenues and unpaved streets where crises simmer and injustice thrives, her unwavering spirit reminds us that from the ashes of heartbreak can spring the drive for transformative change. One anecdote even recounts culture ministers from across the Americas and the Caribbean, after a day of diplomacy, belting out Paquita’s rancheras in a famed venue called “El Munich,” shouting, “Are you listening to me, you useless man?” in unison—a testament to the universality of heartbreak and frustration. Such sentiments of accumulated grievances, deep-seated mistrust, and the urgent need for collective catharsis are also mirrored in the complexities of the energy sector. To understand the current state of the electrical industry, we must trace its evolution nearly a century back. Some researchers argue it was shaped by the interwar period, when rising nationalism and propaganda paved the way for Nazism and global conflict. Others, such as Mr. Steven Bannon, point to more recent events—particularly the 2019 Wuhan crisis—as pivotal in this historical trajectory. Among the primary challenges in our research was establishing a historical period as a baseline and identifying manifest variables as triggers. Consequently, we compared wealth distribution, electricity consumption, and pricing between the affluent “Champagne Cup Society” of the 1980s and today’s billionaire, technology-driven era. We introduced multiple data points into various analytical models to examine how disruptive shifts in global markets have eroded accountability in the energy industry. We also explored the political dilemma of balancing stable governance and rotating leadership—a core principle of democracy—against the sudden disruptions that can destabilise institutions in fragile developing nations. Trust is central to sustaining institutional stability and credibility, a variable we identified as indispensable. Interestingly, our initial findings uncovered “structural imbalances reminiscent of those in a fractured relationship.” But where exactly do these imbalances reside? Among nations, institutions, social groups, or individuals? Who stands to gain, and who is left vulnerable? These questions highlight how deeply economic and political power imbalances can mirror the raw emotional discord Paquita so hauntingly captured. In love and global energy policy, trust is the central issue—its breach leading to heartbreak, upheaval, and an urgent call for systemic change. Earthjustice. (2024). Two Years Ago, We Passed the Biggest Climate Spending Bill Ever. Here’s What It Has Achieved. *Earthjustice*. In recent years, global observers have drawn parallels between deep-rooted economic frictions and the dynamics of a fractured relationship. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the structural imbalance primarily between China and the United States, driven by stark contrasts in trade flows and economic policies. China’s export-driven growth model, reinforced by low labor costs and state-led industrial strategies, clashes with the United States’ significant trade deficit and reliance on imported goods. Add to this divergence in currency regimes—China’s tightly managed yuan versus the freely traded U.S. dollar—and tensions surrounding intellectual property rights create the potential for a protracted trade conflict. These persistent discrepancies fuel broader geopolitical rivalries, evidenced by tit-for-tat tariffs, fierce negotiations, and looming threats of decoupling (Krugman, 2020). The second, more pressing question is whether the global trend genuinely favours renewable energy or pays lip service to it. The underlying challenge relates to “systemic inertia,” the entrenched structures of power and profit that remain heavily invested in coal, oil, and gas (IEA, 2022). While many nations are implementing policies to promote wind farms, solar parks, and battery storage, fossil fuel dependence is immense. Breaking free requires more than technological feasibility; it demands dismantling century-old financial and geopolitical frameworks built upon hydrocarbons. One analysis note, “Fossil fuels are not merely energy commodities; they form the bedrock of modern economies, geopolitical leverage, and global oil empires” (Bridge & Le Billon, 2017). This fundamental truth underscores why any shift towards renewables necessitates a deeper reconfiguration of global power hierarchies—challenging the states and corporations whose influence, capital, and infrastructure are intertwined with fossil extraction and trade. Herein lies the paradox: while new technologies and growing environmental imperatives advocate for decarbonisation, powerful actors defend fossil fuel interests under economic stability, energy security, and job protection. For instance, oil majors invest significantly in lobbying to extend drilling permits, while some governments hesitate to curtail their coal assets due to immediate revenue needs (Rystad Energy, 2022). Even in China—rapidly becoming a world leader in renewables—coal remains a substantial part of its energy matrix, attesting to the complex balance between growth targets and green initiatives (World Bank, 2023). Ultimately, the so-called “war” over energy sources runs more profound than the physical dominance of fossil fields. It is a battle over global order—deciding who writes the rules, who reaps the profits, and whose voice commands the conversation in the age of climate change. A mere pivot to solar panels and wind turbines is insufficient if underlying structures, from financial systems to political alliances, remain tethered to fossil paradigms. This clash could culminate in a genuine clean energy revolution—or a prolonged stalemate that tests the resilience of international cooperation. The fate of the planet’s climate, global prosperity, and geopolitical stability hinges on how swiftly or reluctantly these imbalances are resolved.I The global shift toward green energy has been monumental: trillions of dollars have poured into wind farms, solar installations, electric vehicle infrastructure, and emerging technologies such as hydrogen and advanced battery storage. These funds, sourced from banks, trade unions, and government subsidies, represent not merely a financial bet but a collective commitment to curbing the existential threat of climate change. Yet, the fate of these vast investments hinges on several critical factors that will determine whether green energy continues to flourish or stall under shifting political winds. First, policy stability remains paramount. While many governments set ambitious climate targets and enacted incentives for renewable energy, these policies can swing dramatically with leadership changes. A supportive administration may provide grants, tax breaks, and regulatory backing for new wind farms or solar arrays, only for a successor to scale back or freeze that funding. This inconsistency creates uncertainty for investors, raising the perceived risk of renewable projects. Strong, bipartisan policy frameworks are thus essential for long-term market confidence (IEA, 2023). Second, technological innovation is expanding at breakneck speed, driving down the cost of green energy. Solar and wind power are no longer fringe options; they are increasingly competitive with fossil fuels on a levelized cost basis (IRENA, 2022). Meanwhile, advancements in battery technology and hydrogen fuel cells address intermittency concerns, enabling greater grid flexibility. As new breakthroughs emerge—such as next-generation nuclear, carbon capture solutions, and energy-dense batteries—the green sector could become even more cost-effective, displacing the final barriers to widespread adoption. This virtuous cycle of innovation can, in turn, attract even more capital to the sector. Third, financial sector enthusiasm has shifted. In the past, renewable projects were regarded as niche or high-risk ventures. However, increasing climate awareness and pressure from stakeholders—from trade funds to institutional investors who are mindful of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues—have changed this perception criteria—and have propelled major banks and pension funds to commit billions to green portfolios. The rise of green bonds and sustainability-linked loans provides further evidence that capital markets now view clean energy as a viable, profitable sector (BloombergNEF, 2021). Still, market appetites can change rapidly: a technological stock downturn, a global recession, or geopolitically driven fossil fuel price manipulation could redirect investment flows. Finally, global cooperation plays a pivotal role. Climate change is an international crisis demanding coordinated action. If geopolitical rifts deepen—evidenced by trade wars and resource nationalism—supply chains for wind turbines, solar panels, and battery components could fragment. Such fragmentation would raise costs, hamper innovation, and slow deployment. Conversely, collaboration through treaties, research partnerships, and aligned industrial policies can expedite progress, ensuring that these trillion-dollar investments yield substantial environmental and economic returns (IPCC, 2023). In the end, the green energy sector stands at a critical inflection point. Trillions have already been invested, and many signs—from plummeting technology costs to growing public demand—are optimistic. Yet the sector’s future hinges on stable policy, technological breakthroughs, secure financing, and genuine global cooperation. Should these elements falter, the world risks squandering financial capital and a historic chance to mitigate climate change and reshape the global energy landscape. Rare earth elements (REEs)—a group of 17 metallic elements—have quietly become a decisive factor in the global balance of power [1]. Their unique properties render them essential for advanced defence systems, high-tech industries, and clean energy technologies, fostering intense competition among nations for secure access. [2]. This analysis of the strategic importance of REEs evaluates former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed mineral deal with Ukraine, explores the role of fossil fuels in the evolving world order, and considers how control over key resources might reshape global alignments among the United States, China, and Russia, disrupting all order in every regard. REEs are indispensable to modern economies. They power high-performance magnets in military hardware, electric vehicles, and wind turbines, essential for smartphones, computers, and other digital devices [2]. Although not geologically “rare,” REEs are costly to extract and refine, partly due to their chemical complexity and environmentally damaging byproducts [1]. This makes them strategically vital yet vulnerable to supply shocks. China dominates the global rare earth supply chain, accounting for roughly 90% of global processing capacity [6]. Through state-led investment, low labour costs, and relaxed environmental standards, China undercut other producers in the 1990s and 2000s, forcing mines elsewhere—including the U.S. Mountain Pass facility—to send ore to Chinese refineries [2]. Beijing has demonstrated a willingness to use export controls as a geopolitical lever, briefly suspending supplies to Japan in 2010 and threatening similar measures during trade tensions with the U.S. [7]. Such moves underscore the immense leverage conferred by rare earth dominance. Alarmed by China’s grip, the U.S. and Russia have accelerated efforts to expand domestic output. The U.S. invoked the Defense Production Act to finance new Texas separation facilities while promoting “friend-shoring” with allies like Australia and Canada [4]. Russia, holding sizable reserves of its own, is investing over a billion dollars to develop large deposits in Siberia in hopes of becoming the world’s second-largest producer [3][4]. Despite these efforts, China’s entrenched position remains a formidable obstacle, and shifting the balance will require years of sustained investment and policy coordination [1]. Strategic Significance of Ukraine’s Deposits Ukraine claims to hold up to 5% of the world’s “critical” raw materials, including several promising rare earth sites such as Novopoltavske [1]. This could bolster U.S. energy security and reduce reliance on China [2]. However, much of Ukraine’s mineral data stems from outdated Soviet-era surveys that lack modern feasibility assessments [1]. Many deposits lie in conflict zones, and the country’s energy infrastructure has been severely compromised by war [2][5]. Viability and Obstacles Rare earth extraction demands vast capital, advanced refining processes, and long development timelines—often exceeding a decade [2]. Even if Ukraine confirmed substantial reserves, building the necessary processing infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive, especially amid ongoing hostilities [2][5]. S&P Global deems Ukraine’s REE deposits potentially unprofitable in the short term given high costs, security risks, and logistical barriers [1]. Deal Terms and Friction President Trump’s proposed agreement sought preferential access to Ukraine’s raw materials—potentially claiming 50% of future state-owned resource revenues—without offering Ukraine firm security guarantees [1]. This arrangement alarmed Ukrainian officials, who viewed it as ceding strategic assets without ensuring their defense needs. Negotiations stalled, reflecting the transactional approach favored by the Trump administration and underscoring Ukraine’s precarious position as both a beneficiary of Western support and a potential resource colony [1][2]. In parallel with its global push, China recently signed a deal to develop 280,000 hectares for rare earth mining in Nicaragua [11]. The venture expands Beijing’s reach in Latin America, mirroring similar overseas investments aimed at consolidating control over strategic minerals. Although initial surveys suggest significant REE potential, these deposits' quality and economic viability remain untested [11]. Should they prove profitable, China’s dominance in the sector could grow further, complicating Western efforts to diversify supply chains and secure alternative sources of critical materials [2]. While REEs capture headlines in high-tech sectors, fossil fuels remain a cornerstone of economic and geopolitical power [8]. Central proven oil and natural gas reserves in regions like Canada, China, Venezuela, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Iran, Turkey, Norway, various African nations, and the Arab world continue to shape alliance patterns and trade flows [8][9]. For instance, OPEC+ production decisions can ripple global markets, influencing everything from inflation rates to diplomatic leverage [9]. According to BP’s latest estimates, the world’s proven natural gas reserves could sustain consumption for approximately 50 years [9]. This abundant yet finite supply underpins critical industries and strategic relationships; countries blessed with rich hydrocarbon deposits often wield substantial influence in multilateral negotiations [10]. Even as the clean energy transition accelerates, oil and gas demand remains robust, particularly in emerging markets. Yet balancing hydrocarbon revenues with climate goals has become a significant policy challenge. Governments across the globe—whether in oil-exporting states like Saudi Arabia or gas-rich regions of Africa—face mounting pressure to diversify their economies and reduce dependence on fossil exports [8]. Conversely, consumer nations weigh energy security against environmental obligations, seeking stable supply while pursuing carbon neutrality targets [9]. This tension makes fossil fuels an integral part of the new global order, where traditional energy superpowers and rising renewable champions must navigate a complex interplay of markets, regulations, and diplomacy [10]. Just as oil shaped 20th-century geopolitics, control of REEs could define global power in the 21st century [6]. Nations with stable rare earth supply chains will lead in high-tech manufacturing and defence capabilities, while those lacking access risk economic and security vulnerabilities [7]. China, by maintaining dominance in REE processing, wields a potent tool of economic statecraft that can deter adversaries. Global demand for REEs is surging, fueling fears of “resource wars.” Although outright military clashes over REEs remain unlikely, coercive trade measures and zero-sum resource grabs may escalate tensions [3][6]. Nations holding large, untapped deposits could become flashpoints if foreign investors and local governments clash over extraction rights [5]. In response to China’s near monopoly, the U.S. and its allies have formed initiatives like the Minerals Security Partnership to develop new sources and processing plants in friendly nations [5]. This evolving landscape might result in a bifurcation of supply chains: one led by China (potentially partnered with Russia), and another by the U.S., EU, and allied states [4]. Long-term recycling and substitute materials innovation could mitigate these tensions by reducing dependence on virgin REEs [2][7]. Rare earth elements have shifted from obscure commodities to a focal point of 21st-century geopolitics [6]. The U.S.-China-Russia triangle underscores that REE access equates to strategic power, influencing diplomatic leverage, defence readiness, and industrial competitiveness [1][7]. Meanwhile, fossil fuels continue to undergird many global alliances, with vast oil and natural gas reserves shaping economic resilience and foreign policy [8][9]. As seen in President Trump’s contentious attempt to secure Ukrainian resources, these dynamics can strain alliances and reorder global alignments [2]. Whether the competition evolves into deeper conflict or spurs cooperative innovation depends on the major powers' political choices now. Both rare earths and fossil fuels remain at the heart of a new world order, one defined by resource security, technological leadership, and the delicate balance between national interests and global cooperation.

Energy infrastructure—the pipelines, power grids, ports, railways, and undersea cables that keep modern society running—has become a new battlefield in a surreptitious conflict. Across the globe, state and non-state actors alike engage in espionage, sabotage, and militarized manoeuvres to secure or disrupt energy lifelines. This “dirty war” in the electricity sector echoes past colonial contests over resources and yields far-reaching consequences for international stability and trust. Once seen as purely commercial or civilian, energy facilities are increasingly under military watch. Authorities fear disruptive attacks on power grids, gas terminals, and pipeline routes. In Poland, for example, the government approved legislation in 2023 granting the navy the authority to sink hostile vessels threatening the Baltic Pipe gas link from Norway. Such protection extends to ports, LNG terminals and undersea cables deemed vital to national security. NATO and the European Union similarly fortify undersea pipelines and cables amid heightened awareness following recent sabotage incidents. What was once the domain of engineers and private industry has become a critical theatre of state-level defence strategies. The wave of sabotage illustrates the vulnerability of energy infrastructure. The Nord Stream gas pipeline explosion in the Baltic Sea in September 2022 marked one of the most publicized acts of sabotage in recent history. Investigators concluded it was a deliberate operation but have not definitively attributed blame. The impact was immediate and disruptive, underscoring energy’s central role in geopolitical conflicts. Beyond pipelines, undersea cables carrying internet and electric power also face increased risk. In 2023 and 2024, submarine cables were mysteriously severed in the Baltic Sea, severing communication and potentially threatening energy transfers. While some incidents, such as the Balticconnector rupture between Finland and Estonia, were traced to accidental damage, others remain suspected. Such intrusions often involve “grey-zone” tactics that fall short of open war but are strategic tools to weaken opponents. Cyber threats are equally concerning: hackers linked to various state actors regularly target power grid control systems. The 2015 Ukraine power grid hack, which briefly disrupted electricity for hundreds of thousands, demonstrated the potential devastation of cyber sabotage. Similar tactics could be deployed elsewhere with equally dramatic effects. Today’s contest for energy infrastructure mirrors the 19th-century scramble for colonies, though focused on pipelines, ports, and undersea routes rather than territories. The United States continues its longstanding policy of maintaining a strong military presence in the Middle East to secure key oil shipping lanes. Control of these corridors confers substantial leverage over energy-importing rivals. China, in turn, is investing heavily in overseas infrastructure through the Belt and Road Initiative. Ports, pipelines, and refineries built under this framework enhance Beijing’s global reach. Western observers warn that these ostensibly commercial projects could become dual-use facilities, providing strategic advantages reminiscent of colonial-era imperial bases. Meanwhile, Russia has also wielded energy resources as a strategic lever, sometimes cutting off supplies to influence neighbors politically. Even a seemingly peripheral event can have broader implications. For example, Taiwan’s recent detention of a Congolese-flagged ship crewed by Chinese nationals is seen as a microcosm of more prominent rivalries. The vessel was allegedly involved in cutting an undersea cable, highlighting covert attempts at crippling opponents’ communications or power links without resorting to overt hostilities. While countries pledge transitions to cleaner energy, the immediate economic and political stakes tied to fossil fuels remain huge. The war in Ukraine demonstrates how disruptions in fossil fuel supply reverberate globally. For instance, Europe’s scramble to replace Russian gas sent prices soaring, placing vulnerable economies at risk and prompting wealthier nations to secure supplies first. Alongside oil and gas, rare earth elements—like lithium, cobalt, and other critical minerals—fuel geopolitical competition. These resources underpin electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, and other green technologies crucial to modern economies. China’s dominance in rare earth processing grants it an outsized influence. In response, the U.S., EU, and partners are exploring mining options in Australia, Brazil, and Africa. Competition in this domain has the potential to mirror the 20th-century battles over oil concessions, further straining international relations. The normalization of sabotage erodes trust between nations, complicating collaboration efforts on shared challenges like climate change. Sabotage incidents require time-consuming investigations, generate widespread suspicion, and complicate negotiations. For instance, the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines continues to strain relations among implicated countries, fueling uncertainty over possible future attacks. Moreover, sabotage and cyber intrusions carry economic consequences, from price surges to disruptions in consumer supply. Countries that host strategic infrastructure may be coerced into choosing sides, intensifying blocs and rivalries. Such hostility drives further militarization, creating a feedback loop of suspicion, escalation, and potential open conflict. Despite these challenges, some international frameworks show promise. NATO and the EU have bolstered joint defences of undersea critical infrastructure, and there is growing dialogue on establishing new norms akin to arms-control treaties—albeit for underwater cables and pipeline security. Multilateral cooperation on traceability and accountability in cyberspace could also mitigate risks. Yet these measures remain nascent, and powerful states often flout rules when national interests are at stake. In this era of heightened energy competition, pipelines, grids, and undersea cables play outsized roles in shaping national security. As major powers bolster infrastructure defenses, employ covert sabotage tactics, and jockey for resources, the potential for larger-scale conflict grows. Without robust international cooperation and updated regulatory frameworks, the “dirty war” in the electricity sector will persist, imperilling modern life's networks. To avoid further destabilization, nations must recognize the shared vulnerability of critical energy infrastructure and commit to mutual restraint—lest these clandestine hostilities endanger the entire global system.

The recent and abrupt foreign policy shift by the United States—signalled most starkly by a vote against Ukraine and an unexpected alignment with countries like Cuba, China, Iran, Nicaragua, and North Korea—has upended the carefully woven tapestry of transatlantic cooperation. Observers worldwide describe an “upside-down world” where once-stable alliances appear inverted. Two centuries of collaborative legacy between Europe and America now risk unraveling, raising questions about the durability of a relationship that has shaped modern international structures. Historically, the United States and Europe have shared deep-rooted political, economic, and cultural ties. In the early nineteenth century, a convergence of ideas on democracy, free markets, and liberal governance cultivated trust across the Atlantic. Over time, bilateral trade expanded, and intellectual exchanges accelerated the adoption of shared values, particularly during watershed moments like the Enlightenment’s final echoes in Europe and the US’s pioneering experiments in republican governance. By the early twentieth century, cooperation deepened further with the United States’ decisive entry into World War I, setting the stage for broader strategic alignment. The bond grew even more robust during and after World War II. Europe and America jointly confronted fascist powers, leading to an era of sweeping multilateralism. The Marshall Plan, conceived under President Harry Truman, funnelled critical financial support to a devastated Europe, spurring economic recovery and forging unbreakable political friendships. NATO, also formed under Truman’s watch, symbolized collective security, ensuring that any threat to one nation would be met with a united response from all allies. These initiatives turned shared ideals into tangible structures that anchored global affairs. Throughout the Cold War, this Western alliance stood as the first line of defense against Soviet expansion. European nations, often with heavy American investment and military backing, maintained strong institutions that safeguarded democratic freedoms. The eventual collapse of the Eastern Bloc seemed to validate transatlantic unity, offering a blueprint for how shared sacrifices and diplomatic coordination could bring about systemic change. In recent years, however, subtle fractures emerged, often attributed to disagreements over trade tariffs, differing stances on climate commitments, and questions of burden-sharing in NATO. Yet nothing prepared the world for the scale of the latest pivot in Washington. The United States, once a stalwart supporter of Ukraine, has broken from tradition and aligned itself with regimes historically at odds with Western values. This move has confounded European capitals, questioning the reliability of an ally that once championed democracy worldwide. Economic repercussions loom as well, since regulatory frameworks and trade agreements have become closely intertwined with mutual defense obligations. Politically, a departure from the established consensus on renewable energy further exposes these rifts. Europe has pioneered large-scale green initiatives, counting on American support for a global push toward sustainability. Now faced with an inconsistent U.S. approach—one moment endorsing climate action, the next favoring resource deals with authoritarian regimes—European leaders worry about long-term cooperation. The potential collapse of critical transatlantic projects jeopardizes not only the symbolic unity of the West but also practical collaboration on technological innovation and ecological resilience. Despite the unpredictability in Washington, the history binding Europe and America remains profound. Together, they weathered numerous crises, from the Napoleonic aftermath to the World Wars and the bipolar Cold War standoff. These cumulative experiences underscore a resilience that might yet withstand current upheavals. Recalling the spirit of Truman’s transformative initiatives, voices on both sides of the Atlantic urge for renewed diplomatic engagements. Joint policy statements, multilateral gatherings, and grassroots cultural exchanges could serve as anchors, reminding policymakers of the immense value embedded in two centuries of collective achievements. In an era fraught with crises—geopolitical tensions, energy uncertainties, and emerging global threats—this partnership’s future hinges on a delicate balancing act. If the rift widens, the world may face an even more fragmented international order, prone to regional power plays and ideological competition. Conversely, a recommitment to democratic principles, economic synergies, and security cooperation could reinvigorate the ties that have, for so long, maintained relative global stability. Whether these bonds endure will depend on leaders' willingness, on both sides of the Atlantic, to remember the legacy of 200 years and find the foresight to preserve it. Freedman, L.

However, beyond its bold and defiant lyrics, some cultural commentators point to a significant political backstory tied to the “Solidaridad” (Solidarity) program introduced by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988–1994). This initiative was initially promoted as an innovative strategy to combat poverty by channeling resources into marginalized regions, developing infrastructure, and fostering community participation in Mexico and throughout the Americas. At first, Solidaridad was lauded for its apparent promise. Schools, clinics, and roads were to be built in rural and impoverished areas, raising hopes for tangible economic and social progress. Over time, dissenting voices grew louder, alleging that the program operated more as a political tool than a true path to development. Accusations of clientelism and misappropriation of funds further tarnished Solidaridad’s reputation. According to critics, this supposedly “wonderful” program quickly revealed itself as an empty mirage, concealing a web of corruption that ultimately undermined its lofty rhetoric. In this context, the piercing anger of “Rata de dos patas” takes on fresh significance. Beyond capturing the bitterness of romantic betrayal, the song reflects a broader sense of disillusionment and outrage among communities that felt hoodwinked by a government claiming to champion their needs. The biting insult of “rat” fits neatly with the sentiment of being deceived: just as the unmasked illusions of Solidaridad laid bare the administration’s failings, Paquita’s lyrics call out false promises and moral bankruptcy. Consequently, “Rata de dos patas” not only stands as a cultural emblem of spurned love but also underscores the depth of collective frustration when political promises implode under their weight, revealing a stark reality of broken trust and unmet expectations. The song's impact on political science is profound, as it highlights the emotional resonance of political betrayal. It serves as a reminder that political promises, when unfulfilled, can lead to deep-seated mistrust and disillusionment among citizens. This mistrust can have far-reaching consequences, affecting voter turnout, civic engagement, and overall confidence in democratic institutions. The lyrics of “Rata de dos patas” tap into a universal sentiment of feeling let down by those in power, making it a potent symbol of political discontent. Moreover, the song's enduring popularity underscores the importance of cultural expressions in political discourse. Music and art often reflect societal sentiments more vividly than academic analyses, providing a lens through which to view the emotional undercurrents of political events. In this way, “Rata de dos patas” becomes a tool for understanding the emotional landscape of political disappointment and the challenges faced by governments in maintaining public trust. In an era fraught with crises—geopolitical tensions, energy uncertainties, and emerging global threats—this partnership’s future hinges on a delicate balancing act. If the rift widens, the world may face an even more fragmented international order, prone to regional power plays and ideological competition. Conversely, a recommitment to democratic principles, economic synergies, and security cooperation could reinvigorate the ties that have, for so long, maintained relative global stability. Whether these bonds endure will depend on leaders' willingness, on both sides of the Atlantic, to remember the legacy of 200 years and find the foresight to preserve it. The legacy of “Rata de dos patas” serves as a cautionary tale for political leaders, emphasizing the importance of transparency, accountability, and genuine commitment to the welfare of citizens. It reminds us that political actions have emotional consequences that can resonate deeply within society, shaping public perception and trust in governance. As such, the song stands as a testament to the power of cultural expressions in reflecting and influencing political sentiments, highlighting the need for integrity and honesty in political leadership.

Let’s dive deeper—where should we explore next? 🚀📊🔍 The world faces an unprecedented convergence of global risks, many of which stem from resource competition, geopolitical realignments, climate change, and emerging energy vulnerabilities. These risks threaten stability, economic prosperity, and long-term security. The growing demand for fossil fuels, rare earth elements (REEs), and critical minerals has heightened tensions between major economies, exacerbating geopolitical rivalries and increasing the potential for direct military confrontations. The dominance of China in rare earth processing (controlling over 90% of the global market) has led to strategic stockpiling by Western nations and efforts to diversify supply chains. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Canada are racing to develop their own mining and refining capacity, while Russia is expanding rare earth mining in Siberia to counterbalance Western influence. Countries that control these resources gain technological and defense advantages, shaping the next global power struggle. The Nord Stream pipeline explosions in 2022 marked a turning point in the security of global energy infrastructure, demonstrating how critical pipelines and undersea cables remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, sabotage, and geopolitical disruptions. More recently, mystery attacks on Baltic gas pipelines and power cables (2023–24) have raised alarm over covert hybrid warfare tactics used to destabilize nations. Energy grids, telecommunications infrastructure, and key shipping routes (such as the Panama Canal and the Strait of Hormuz) have become primary targets in a new era of energy-based conflicts. The fracturing of global alliances and the erosion of diplomatic trust pose serious risks. U.S.–China tensions over trade, technology, and REEs have led to a strategic decoupling of supply chains. Meanwhile, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions have redrawn global trade routes, forcing Moscow to pivot energy exports toward China and India. The European Union’s push for energy independence from Russia has reshaped global LNG markets, while Iran’s renewed oil trade with China has further divided global energy alliances. These shifting relationships highlight structural imbalances reminiscent of those in a fractured relationship, where major powers increasingly act unilaterally rather than cooperatively. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and water shortages are accelerating the need for a global energy transition. However, this transition is being delayed by political divisions over fossil fuel dependency, with some governments prioritizing energy security over climate commitments. The U.S., EU, and China continue to invest in renewables, but OPEC nations and fossil fuel-dependent economies resist rapid shifts. Climate-driven resource conflicts—such as disputes over drought-stricken river basins, desertification, and access to lithium deposits—are emerging as new flashpoints in global stability. Together, these risks underscore the fragility of modern energy, trade, and security networks, highlighting the urgent need for resilience strategies. The global energy sector is at a crossroads, with two competing pathways: Continuation of Fossil Fuels Many governments prioritize short-term energy security by extending the life of oil, gas, and coal, particularly in response to geopolitical disruptions and energy crises. The ongoing war in Ukraine, rising tensions in the Middle East, and U.S. policy shifts under a second Trump administration could see increased fossil fuel production and deregulation. Gradual but Unstoppable Rise of Renewables Technological breakthroughs in solar, wind, energy storage, and hydrogen will continue, driven by declining costs, corporate net-zero pledges, and public demand for clean air. However, major challenges remain: scaling battery production, securing REE supplies, and overhauling outdated grid infrastructure to accommodate intermittent renewables. Automation, AI-driven energy management, and advanced smart grids will be crucial for integrating these energy sources efficiently. Additionally, the race to secure critical minerals for electric vehicle (EV) batteries—including lithium, nickel, and cobalt—will reshape global trade relationships. In the near future, most nations will rely on hybrid energy systems, integrating renewables with traditional baseload power (natural gas, coal, nuclear). The continued reliance on gas-fired power plants will ensure stability, especially as grids adapt to variable wind and solar generation. Over time, improved battery storage, decentralized grids, and advanced transmission technologies will allow renewables to supply the majority of global electricity demand. Regions investing in offshore wind, advanced geothermal, and next-generation nuclear reactors will lead the transition. The global energy mix will remain diverse but will vary based on policy and technological advances: Fossil Fuels: Oil and gas remain dominant in transportation, heavy industry, and power generation, especially where energy security concerns outweigh climate commitments. Renewables: Wind, solar, and geothermal continue to grow, with government incentives and falling technology costs driving adoption. Nuclear: Some countries (France, Canada, China) are reinvesting in nuclear power for stable, low-carbon electricity, though waste management and safety concerns remain barriers. Hydrogen: Green hydrogen could replace natural gas in industrial applications, but cost reductions and infrastructure development are needed before mass adoption. Despite political setbacks (such as U.S. policy reversals under Trump), long-term trends still favor renewables. Key drivers include: Cost-competitiveness: Wind and solar power are now cheaper than fossil fuels in many regions. Government incentives: Policies such as Europe’s Green Deal and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provide billions in subsidies for clean energy projects. Corporate demand: Tech giants and multinational corporations are shifting to 100% renewable energy, driving investment. International commitments: Even amid political uncertainty, nations are increasingly bound by climate treaties and emission reduction goals. While the U.S. has the resources and market size to sustain itself economically, losing Europe as a trade partner and geopolitical ally would weaken its global influence. A transatlantic split could lead to: Stronger EU-China cooperation on trade and clean energy technology. U.S. energy and defense industry setbacks, as Europe seeks alternative suppliers. Weakened NATO cohesion, making global security more volatile. Europe, in turn, would face challenges in replacing U.S. military and economic cooperation, potentially accelerating its move toward strategic autonomy. Financial markets are increasingly favoring clean energy investments, but uncertainty remains. Banks may: Limit funding for high-risk renewable projects in regions with unstable policies. Favor fossil fuel expansion if policy shifts suggest stronger government backing. Increase green financing options in response to carbon-neutral pledges. No. Energy transitions, infrastructure projects, and supply chain realignments take decades, not years. While short-term policies can set the direction, achieving meaningful transformation within a three-year window is unlikely. A second Trump administration could take a more pragmatic stance toward Russia, prioritizing energy trade and negotiations over sanctions. However, geopolitical tensions—especially over Ukraine—could limit any potential rapprochement. If Western support declines, Ukraine could face increased vulnerability. However, continued EU and NATO backing may sustain its long-term defense. The war’s outcome will depend on Western resolve, Russia’s strategy, and potential diplomatic settlements. While unlikely under current treaties, the U.S. remains invested in securing global shipping routes. Increased Chinese influence in Latin America could prompt greater U.S. military and economic involvement in Panama, but direct control is improbable. U.S. & Europe: Strained over energy policies, trade disputes, and NATO commitments. China: Dominates REE supply chains, escalating U.S.–China trade tensions. Iran: Expanding energy ties with China and Russia amid sanctions. Russia: Redirecting oil and gas sales to non-Western markets. Resolution of these disputes will require new diplomatic alignments, resource diversification, and long-term trust-building. The world is undergoing a seismic energy and geopolitical transition, shaped by competition over resources, technology, and climate policies. Despite setbacks, clean energy remains on an upward trajectory, while fossil fuel politics remain deeply entrenched. The next decade will determine whether nations successfully navigate these shifts—or descend into further conflict and economic fragmentation.

Canada is one of the most resource-rich countries on Earth, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Arctic coasts. Its vast territory—home to forests, mountains, plains, and a lengthy coastline—has produced an abundance of natural resources, including energy (oil, natural gas, hydropower), minerals (gold, copper, nickel, potash), forest products, fisheries, and agricultural land. (1) Economic Growth: They generate revenue, support exports, create jobs, and stimulate investment. Regional Development: Resource-based industries are the economic backbone for many rural and remote communities. Trade: Canada is a major global exporter of energy, minerals, lumber, and agricultural commodities. (2) Oil Sands: Alberta’s oil sands represent the third-largest oil reserves in the world. Extraction primarily occurs around Fort McMurray (Athabasca oil sands), along with deposits at Peace River and Cold Lake. Conventional Oil: Found in parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and offshore fields near Newfoundland and Labrador. Natural Gas: Abundant in Western Canada (primarily Alberta and British Columbia). Key deposits are in the Montney and Duvernay Formations. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): Coastal British Columbia is expected to become a critical hub for LNG exports. (3) Canada ranks among the world’s largest producers of hydroelectricity. Provinces like Québec, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Newfoundland & Labrador host significant hydro infrastructure. Prominent examples include the James Bay Project (Québec), the W. A. C. Bennett Dam (BC), and the Churchill Falls Generating Station (Labrador). (4) Wind Energy: Rapid expansion in Ontario, Québec, Alberta, and the Maritime provinces. Solar Energy: Growing in Ontario and Alberta but remains a relatively small share of total energy production. Present potential in specific regions but remains niche compared to hydro and wind. (6) Precious Metals: This includes gold (in Ontario, Québec, BC, Nunavut), silver (often a by-product of base metal mining), and platinum group metals (in Ontario and Québec). Base Metals: Significant deposits of copper (BC, Ontario, Québec), nickel (Sudbury Basin, Voisey’s Bay, Thompson), and zinc/lead (New Brunswick, Québec, Manitoba). Iron Ore: Large mines operate in the Labrador Trough near the Quebec–Labrador border. Potash: Saskatchewan is the world’s largest potash producer, essential for fertilizer. Diamonds: Discoveries in the Northwest Territories (Ekati, Diavik) and northern Ontario (Victor Mine) have placed Canada among the world’s leading diamond producers. Uranium: The Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan hosts some of the highest-grade uranium deposits globally. (7) Canada boasts approximately 9% of the world’s forests, featuring vast boreal forests stretching from Yukon to Newfoundland and Labrador, alongside coniferous and mixed forests in British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec. The forestry sector—which includes lumber, pulp and paper, and engineered wood products—employs many Canadians and supports significant exports. Most of Canada’s lumber is produced in British Columbia, Québec, and Ontario. (8) Boasting the world’s longest coastline along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans, Canada’s marine fisheries have traditionally been significant (e.g., Atlantic cod, until its collapse in the early 1990s). Today, major fisheries include lobster, snow crab, shrimp, salmon, and shellfish along both coasts. Freshwater fisheries contribute on a smaller scale, whereas aquaculture (salmon, mussels) is expanding in BC and the Maritimes. (9) Prairie Provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba): Known for extensive fields of wheat, canola, barley, and other grains. Saskatchewan leads in canola production. Fruit and Vegetable Production: Ontario’s Niagara region, BC’s Okanagan Valley, and select areas nationwide have thriving horticultural sectors. Livestock: Alberta is renowned for beef, while Québec and Ontario are strong in dairy; Manitoba is a key hog producer. (10) Exports: Energy (oil, gas), minerals (like gold, potash), and forestry products form pillars of the export economy, with the U.S. as Canada’s largest trade partner. Employment and GDP: These sectors employ hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Alberta’s economy leans heavily on oil and gas, while forestry is a mainstay in many rural BC and Québec communities. Regional Development: Resource wealth spurs infrastructure improvements, population growth, and broader economic development in remote locales, such as mining towns in Northern Ontario. (11) Oil Sands: Criticized for high greenhouse gas emissions. Both producers and government bodies have aimed to lower extraction’s carbon footprint, yet international concerns persist. Forestry Management: Canada’s sustainable forest policies support reforestation and best practices, although old-growth logging in BC remains contentious. (12) Many resource-rich regions overlap with lands historically used or claimed by Indigenous peoples. Modern treaties, impact-benefit agreements, and consultation frameworks strive to ensure that Indigenous communities have meaningful input on projects and share in potential benefits. (13) Large projects—oil pipelines, mines, hydro dams—undergo federal or provincial reviews. While provinces manage natural resources, federal rules apply to fisheries, navigable waters, GHGs, and interprovincial or international initiatives. (14) Pipeline proposals—such as Trans Mountain, Keystone XL, and Energy East—highlight tensions between economic benefits and environmental/climate responsibilities. (15) Canada is diversifying its energy mix (hydro, wind, solar) and reducing emissions with a national carbon tax and clean energy investments. Clean-tech innovation is crucial for long-term competitiveness in the global market. (16) Continued Global Demand: As global markets seek materials—particularly critical minerals (nickel, lithium, cobalt)—Canada can expand responsibly to meet EV and renewable energy demands. Sustainability: Heightened environmental awareness, climate goals, and Indigenous rights obligations mean stricter scrutiny of resource developments. Economic Diversification: Provinces reliant on hydrocarbons (e.g., Alberta) explore petrochemicals, renewables, and high-tech. Meanwhile, forestry and mining firms are investing in greener, value-added processes. Technology and Innovation: Automated systems, AI, and advanced exploration methods transform resource sectors. Carbon capture in the oil sands, sustainable forestry, and precision agriculture lead Canada’s resource evolution. Global Geopolitics: Demand for stable, responsibly sourced commodities may benefit Canada, known for political stability and strong regulations. However, competition and commodity price volatility remain ongoing challenges. (17) Canada’s vast oil, gas, mineral, forestry, and water assets power its economy and exports. Economic Significance: Energy and mining lead export revenues, while forestry and agriculture remain lifelines for rural areas. Environmental Balancing Act: Mitigating climate change, conserving habitats, and honoring Indigenous rights are central to managing these resources. Policy and Innovation: Stricter regulations, carbon pricing, and advancing tech (clean tech) guide the transformation of Canada’s resource sectors. Global Role: Rising global demand—particularly for critical minerals—positions Canada as a potential leader in the shift toward a low-carbon future. Canada’s natural resources have played a central role in shaping its history, economy, and national identity. From Alberta’s vast oil sands and northern mineral deposits to its abundant forests and rich fisheries, the country’s resources are a cornerstone of its development. However, Canada's main challenge is how to harness these resources sustainably in an increasingly uncertain global environment. Striking a balance between economic growth, environmental responsibility, and collaboration with Indigenous communities is crucial for the future of Canada’s resource-driven industries. In addition, Canada is a major producer and exporter of natural gas, with much of its exports traditionally focused on the U.S. market. However, with the growing interest and development of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports, Canada is now positioning itself to tap into broader global markets. The following section will explore Canada's natural gas exports in detail and delve into key industry considerations. (18) Canada is one of the world’s top natural gas producers. Most of its output originates in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB)—spanning Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan. Alberta remains the foremost producer, yet British Columbia’s share has surged thanks to shale developments such as the Montney. By 2023, BC generated about 6.7 Bcf/d of gas (36% of the country’s total). Saskatchewan’s volumes (~0.3–0.4 bcf/d) have declined, and offshore Atlantic production ended in 2018. Canadian marketable gas production reached approximately 17.9 Bcf/d in 2023, reflecting technological strides such as horizontal drilling and fracking. (19) The United States continues to be the prime market for Canadian natural gas. Historically, nearly all Canadian exports have flowed south through pipelines. In 2023, Canada exported about 3.1 Tcf of natural gas—100% of which was directed to the U.S. Canada remains the most significant external gas supplier to the United States, reflecting deep North American market integration. However, the U.S. “shale revolution” significantly increased American gas production, reducing demand for Canadian imports. Although Canadian shipments have decreased from their mid-2000s peak, and the U.S. now exports some gas northward, it still buys about half of Canada’s production, emphasizing the “one-customer story.” (20) Canada’s pipeline network is extensive. The Nova Gas Transmission Limited (NGTL) system in Alberta gathers gas for multiple corridors: Western Corridor (to the U.S. West Coast): Includes Foothills Pipeline to Kingsgate (BC–Idaho) and Westcoast (Enbridge BC) to Sumas (BC–Washington). Midcontinent/Midwest Corridor: Alliance Pipeline, Foothills system at Monchy (SK–Montana). Great Lakes/Northeast Corridor: TC Energy’s Canadian Mainline extends through SK and MB to ON, then crosses into U.S. markets at Emerson (MB–MN), Sarnia/Detroit, and Niagara/NY. (21) Although Canada is a major producer, it lacked large-scale LNG export capacity for years. While the U.S., Australia, and Qatar rapidly grew LNG exports, Canada has only now begun major LNG projects in British Columbia: LNG Canada (Kitimat, BC): A CAD $40-billion venture led by Shell. Phase 1 aims for ~14 Mtpa (~1.8 Bcf/d) starting exports by 2025, potentially doubling later. Woodfibre LNG (Squamish, BC): About 2.1 Mtpa (~0.3 Bcf/d), powered by hydro, targeting niche Asian markets. Cedar LNG (Kitimat, BC): Using hydropower, a floating LNG facility led by the Haisla First Nation, ~3 Mtpa (~0.4 Bcf/d). Other projects remain in planning, including East Coast LNG proposals (e.g., Goldboro in Nova Scotia, conversion of Canaport) that focus on Europe, though these remain uncertain. (22) Canada’s gas export trends have shifted over the past decade. After peaking near 10 Bcf/d in the early 2000s, exports fell to ~6–7 Bcf/d by the mid-2010s as U.S. domestic production surged. By 2021, Canada shipped about 2.8 Tcf (~80 Bcm), accounting for half of its total production, almost entirely to the U.S. This heavy reliance on one buyer makes Canada vulnerable to U.S. market changes. Economically, revenue from these exports has fluctuated with price cycles—historically high in the early 2000s, then lower through much of the 2010s, and rebounding during the 2021–2022 price spikes. Natural gas is vital to Canada’s energy GDP and trade balance. (23) Despite being a major producer, Canada’s global gas trade has been modest, as nearly all exports are directed to the U.S. With new LNG capacity, Canada could emerge as a top ten LNG exporter, selling to Asia or Europe. Advantages include shorter shipping routes to Northeast Asia than the U.S. Gulf Coast and abundant, stable reserves. Challenges involve competition from established exporters (U.S., Qatar, Australia, Russia) and the necessity for efficient, timely development. (24) Federal Regulation: The Canadian Energy Regulator oversees interprovincial pipelines and LNG export licensing. Provincial Responsibilities: Alberta and BC manage royalties, environmental standards, and upstream rules. Climate Commitments: Federal carbon pricing, methane reduction, sectoral emissions caps. Export Market Approach: While British Columbia and Alberta advocate for LNG expansions, the East Coast's approach to LNG has been met with scepticism. Overall, Canada aims to support gas development consistent with its climate policies. (25) Environmental and Climate Concerns: GHG footprint, habitat impacts, and protests from communities and Indigenous groups. Infrastructure Bottlenecks: High-cost pipelines and LNG megaprojects, remote conditions (e.g., Arctic), regulatory hurdles. Market Competition & Volatility: The global gas sector is competitive; prices can swing sharply, affecting profit margins for costly projects. Regulatory Delays: Complex federal/provincial reviews and possible legal disputes over jurisdiction. Indigenous & Community Opposition: Earning local support (social license) is essential; many oppose or demand stringent conditions for resource projects. (26) If these obstacles are handled effectively, Canada’s gas exports can: Growing LNG Capacity: Projects like LNG Canada, Woodfibre, Cedar tap into Asian markets. Maintain U.S. Pipeline Trade: The U.S. remains a core customer, though overshadowed by domestic shale. Boost Economic and Industrial Growth: Expand upstream production, foster Indigenous partnerships, adopt new technologies. Potential Transition to Hydrogen: Longer-term pivot to low-carbon gas/hydrogen could diversify exports further. (27) In short, Canada's natural gas export sector presents significant opportunities but faces substantial challenges. Transitioning from a pipeline-reliant domestic supplier to a globally recognized LNG exporter represents a challenging evolution in Canadian energy policy. While the U.S. market remains crucial, developing LNG infrastructure in British Columbia, and potentially on the East Coast, will facilitate access to Asian markets and beyond. The potential benefits include considerable revenue generation, job creation, and enhanced geopolitical influence. However, navigating this pathway necessitates addressing climate commitments, respecting Indigenous rights, adhering to stringent regulations, and competing internationally. With strategic planning and effective collaboration, Canada has the potential to become a leading global supplier of cleaner energy, aligning economic growth with climate-conscious policies. (28) Under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Canada recognised the People’s Republic of China in 1970—years before the U.S. This established a lasting framework for bilateral trade, investment, and cultural exchanges. However, episodes of tension have arisen over human rights issues and politicised arrests (e.g., the Meng Wanzhou case and the detention of the “Two Michaels”). (29) China stands as Canada’s second-largest trading partner. Canadian exports to China include natural resources (lumber, minerals, canola) and educational services; imports typically encompass consumer goods and electronics. In 2018–2019, China’s temporary ban on Canadian canola highlighted the risk of heavy reliance on one market. Canada additionally contends with China’s opaque regulatory practices and IP theft concerns. Ø Human Rights: Ongoing concerns about Xinjiang (Uyghurs), Hong Kong’s freedoms and civil liberties. Ø Espionage & Interference: CSIS repeatedly warns of Chinese attempts to influence Canadian institutions, elections, and controversial detentions (Meng Wanzhou, Two Michaels). Ø Arctic & Sovereignty: China’s declared status as a “near-Arctic state” alarms Canada about sovereignty threats in the far north. Ø Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): Canada remains outside the BRI, wary of China’s strategic and economic influence globally. (30) Canada, a close U.S. ally, generally aligns with Washington on key security policies (e.g., banning Huawei from 5G). Simultaneously, Ottawa seeks to maintain constructive relations with Beijing for trade purposes. Striking a balance between protecting Canada’s national security interests and taking advantage of China’s vast market remains an ongoing challenge. (31) Canada maintained diplomatic ties with the USSR from 1942, aligning with NATO against Soviet expansion after WWII. Despite political hostility, limited commerce (like wheat exports) persisted. Following the USSR’s collapse, Canada supported Russia’s market transition and welcomed it into the G8, collaborating on nuclear disarmament and Arctic initiatives. Relations deteriorated by the late 2000s. (32) Both countries assert overlapping claims in the Arctic, submitting extended continental shelf documentation. Although there was previously cooperation in the Arctic Council, Russia’s military buildup and Canada’s expansions in Arctic patrol capabilities signal wariness on both sides. (33) Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea spurred Canada to join allies in imposing sanctions and cooling trade and diplomatic contacts. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine led Canada to escalate sanctions, prohibit Russian energy imports, and enable the seizure of sanctioned Russian assets to aid Ukraine’s reconstruction. (34) Under Operation REASSURANCE, Canada leads the NATO battlegroup in Latvia, contributing troops, fighter jets, and warships to bolster Eastern Europe’s defenses. Politically, Canada decries Putin’s aggression and closely coordinates with G7 partners to isolate Russia on the world stage. (35) Canada is home to over a million citizens of Ukrainian descent—making it one of the largest Ukrainian diasporas. It was one of the first countries to recognise Ukraine’s independence in 1991. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress wields influence to maintain strong political and humanitarian support for Ukraine. (36) POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC SOLIDARITY Canada consistently upholds Ukraine’s sovereignty. Prime Minister Trudeau has visited Kyiv several times to reaffirm Canada’s “unwavering support.” Canadian MPs have passed motions endorsing Ukraine’s democratic path and condemning Russian incursions. Operation UNIFIER: Since 2015, Canadian forces have trained over 33,000 Ukrainian personnel, helping modernize Ukraine’s military. Post-2022 Invasion: Canada has committed more than CA$ 4.5 billion in defence aid, including artillery, armour, air defence, training, and intelligence-sharing. The scale of this assistance surpasses what might be expected from a country of Canada’s size. (37) Canada has provided billions in loans and direct financial assistance to the Ukrainian government, and considerable humanitarian aid. By mid-2023, over 165,000 Ukrainians had sought refuge in Canada under the Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET). (38) Ottawa plays an active role in broad sanctions against Russia and endorses Ukraine’s aspiration toward NATO and EU membership. Ukrainian leaders often praise Canada as one of their staunchest allies. (39) Donald Trump’s presidency offered contradictory signals on Ukraine—public sympathy toward Russia (e.g., “Crimea is Russian”) alongside the official continuance of sanctions. His freezing of Ukrainian military aid in 2019 (seeking political concessions) alarmed Canada, underscoring its potential vulnerability if U.S. policy shifted drastically. As of February 2025, President Donald Trump's administration's policy toward Ukraine has undergone significant shifts, marked by a departure from previous strategies and a move toward direct negotiations with Russia. (40) Ø Direct Negotiations with Russia: President Trump has initiated direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, aiming to negotiate an end to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These discussions have notably excluded Ukraine and European allies, raising concerns about potential concessions to Russia and the implications for Ukraine's sovereignty. Ø Economic Partnership Proposal: The Trump administration has proposed an economic partnership with Ukraine, focusing on U.S. investment in key sectors such as natural resources and infrastructure. This initiative is designed to stimulate Ukraine's economic growth and ensure that generated revenue supports long-term reconstruction. The partnership emphasizes transparency and aims to align American and Ukrainian interests. Ø Criticism of Ukrainian Leadership: President Trump has openly denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, branding him a "dictator" and alleging that he misled the U.S. into funding an unwinnable war. This rhetoric has strained relations and raised concerns about future U.S. support for Ukraine. (41) Ø Reaffirmation of Support for Ukraine: Considering recent U.S. policy shifts, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reiterated Canada's steadfast support for Ukraine. Trudeau highlighted that Ukraine's struggle is crucial not only for its sovereignty but also for global stability. Ø Diplomatic Engagements: Prime Minister Trudeau has discussed the conflict in Ukraine with President Trump, aiming to address concerns over the evolving U.S. stance and its potential impact on NATO unity and European security. (42) Canada fears a sudden U.S. retreat from Ukraine. In response, Canada might strengthen ties with European allies to preserve sanctions and military aid, possibly clashing with Washington if a new “peace” deal compels Ukraine to surrender territory. (43) Canada adheres to “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” It would oppose any imposed settlement that rewards Russian aggression, coordinating diplomatically with allies to shape potential negotiations and retain sanctions until Ukraine’s sovereignty is honored. (44) Canada’s natural gas export sector offers significant promise but faces considerable challenges. Transitioning from a pipeline-dependent continental supplier to a globally recognized LNG exporter marks a crucial turning point in Canadian energy policy. While the U.S. market remains crucial, developing LNG infrastructure in British Columbia (and potentially on the East Coast) will create new routes to Asia and beyond. Potential rewards are substantial: revenue, job creation, and enhanced geopolitical standing. However, the path ahead requires addressing climate obligations, Indigenous rights, strict regulations, and international competition. With strategic planning and prudent collaboration, Canada could emerge as a key global supplier of cleaner energy, harmonizing economic growth with climate-conscious policies. Canada’s relationships with China, Russia, and Ukraine highlight its middle-power balancing act: combining economic pragmatism with unwavering support for democratic principles. Relations with China have deteriorated due to concerns over human rights issues., alleged espionage, Arctic ambitions, and economic leverage. Relations with Russia collapsed after its 2014 action in Crimea and sank further when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, prompting Canadian sanctions and a strong NATO presence. Meanwhile, Canada’s partnership with Ukraine—rooted in historical diasporic links—has reached new heights via intense military and humanitarian aid. Canada must reconcile its strategic and economic needs with promoting human rights and global norms in all three relationships. During Donald Trump’s presidency, Canada remained steadfast in sanctioning Russia and supporting Ukraine, even as U.S. signals wavered. Another Trump administration could pose further challenges, possibly requiring Canada to bind closer to Europe if the U.S. scaled back its support for Ukraine. Still, Canada’s overall foreign policy trajectory remains constant: upholding the rules-based international system, sanctioning aggressors, and championing allied nations under threat. Belief in the sanctity of territorial sovereignty underpins Canada’s Ukraine stance and shapes its approach to Russia. Concurrently, Canada seeks practical economic ties with China yet stands ready to defend its core interests. Domestically, Canada’s resource-driven economy—and especially its natural gas sector—is evolving to tackle environmental concerns, Indigenous reconciliation, and global competition. Internationally, Canada’s firm stance on democracy and stability endures. The coming years will test how effectively Ottawa can maintain cohesion with its partners—including an unpredictable U.S.—while pursuing its own national aims in a rapidly transforming geopolitical setting.

Workart is fully part of Germán & Co. Iran has abundant natural resources, notably its vast oil and gas reserves. It holds the world’s second-largest natural gas reserves and fourth-largest proven oil reserves (1), making hydrocarbons a cornerstone of its economy. Other resources include significant mineral deposits (like copper and iron ore), agricultural land across various climates, and fisheries along the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf. These resources play a crucial role in Iran’s economy by generating export earnings and supporting industries, although international sanctions have constrained full utilization. Energy Resources: Oil and Natural Gas are Iran’s flagship resources. The country has an estimated 209 billion barrels of oil (about 12% of global reserves) and over 1,200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (about 17% of global reserves) (2). It was OPEC’s 5th-largest oil producer in 2021 and the world’s 3rd-largest gas producer. (3) Most oil fields lie in the southwest (Khuzestan) and offshore in the Persian Gulf, while the giant South Pars gas field in the Gulf (shared with Qatar) drives gas output. Iran also has some hydropower dams and is exploring renewables (solar and wind) given its sunny deserts and windy plains, but fossil fuels dominate its energy mix. Minerals: Iran boasts 68 types of minerals with large reserves of copper, iron ore, zinc, lead, chromite, and others. (4) It is among the world’s top 10 in copper and zinc reserves and is a leading producer of steel and cement in the region. Major mining centres (e.g., Sarcheshmeh for copper) feed domestic and export industries. A recent notable find is a massive lithium deposit (~8.5 million tons) in Hamedan, which, if verified, would be the world’s second largest and could position Iran in the global battery supply chain. (5) Forestry: Iran’s forest cover is limited (around 6–7% of its land). The most significant forests in the north are the Caspian Hyrcanian forests, harbouring hardwood species. Elsewhere, forests in the Zagros Mountains and other areas are sparse due to arid climates. Timber production is modest and primarily for domestic use, with strict controls on logging to prevent desertification. Fisheries: Iran has a longstanding fishing industry, with coastlines on the Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and Caspian Sea. The Persian Gulf yields shrimp and fish, while the Caspian was once famed for sturgeon and caviar. Fisheries and aquaculture contribute to the food supply and employ coastal communities, though their share of GDP is relatively small. Agriculture: Iran’s varied climate supports a diverse agriculture sector on its arable lands (about 30% of land area). Key staples include wheat (strategically important for food security) and rice in the north. Iran is a leading global producer of specialty crops like pistachios, saffron, and dates. Other major products are fruits (pomegranates, citrus), nuts, cotton, and livestock (notably sheep and goats). Agriculture accounts for roughly 10–13% of GDP and over 15% of employment), (6) making it vital for rural livelihoods even as oil dominates exports. Natural resources underpin Iran’s economy, primarily through hydrocarbons. Oil and gas have traditionally provided a large share of government revenue and export earnings – in 2021, they still made up an estimated 45% of government budget revenues. (6) When sanctions allow, crude oil exports (historically 2–2.5 million barrels per day) bring in hard currency, primarily from Asian markets. The energy sector’s impact on GDP is significant (oil/gas ~25% of GDP in some years, though volatile), and it drives downstream industries like refining and petrochemicals. The mining sector is a growing contributor: Iran’s metals and minerals (iron, copper, steel, etc.) form a key part of “non-oil” exports, earning about $8.8 billion in 8 months of 2024. (7) Agriculture, while only ~10% of GDP, remains vital for employment and food self-sufficiency, and Iran exports high-value crops (pistachios, fruits) to earn foreign exchange. Resource industries also spur regional development – for example, oil operations have urbanized parts of Khuzestan, and mining has boosted cities in Kerman and Yazd. However, Iran’s over-reliance on oil makes the economy vulnerable to price swings and sanctions-induced export drops (8), leading to volatile growth and inflation. Iran faces a balancing act between resource extraction and environmental stewardship. Oil and gas operations contribute to greenhouse emissions, and Iran has one of the highest CO₂ output levels globally. The government has set modest climate targets under the Paris Agreement, but economic pressures often override emissions cuts. Domestic energy is heavily subsidised, leading to inefficient use and urban air pollution. Gas flaring (burning off excess gas) in oilfields is an ongoing issue, wasting resources and emitting pollutants, though there are efforts to curb it. Water scarcity is a critical environmental challenge – decades of damming and overuse for irrigation have led to drying wetlands and groundwater depletion. This issue came to a head with protests over water in farming regions. Regulatory oversight exists (e.g., an Environmental Protection Organization), but enforcement is uneven. High-profile incidents, like the 2019 oil pipeline leak in the south or industrial waste in rivers, have raised public concern. Iran is taking steps in renewables – installing wind farms and solar parks – as sustainable supplements to its energy mix, partly to free up more oil for export and reduce urban smog. On the social side, local and Indigenous community rights are increasingly part of the conversation. While Iran doesn’t use the term “Indigenous” in the same way as some other countries, there are ethnic communities (e.g. Arab minorities in oil-rich Khuzestan or Baluch farmers in the southeast) voicing grievances that resource projects haven’t benefited them proportionately. The government has tried directing more oil revenue to provincial budgets and offers compensation for land in mining areas, but tensions remain. Policy reforms like the “Resistance Economy” strategy encourage diversifying away from raw oil exports – for example, by investing in petrochemical plants (adding value to oil/gas) and expanding the mining value chain (more metal processing domestically). Sanctions have pushed Iran to pivot its trade: more oil is being processed into petrochemicals for export and bartered with neighbours and China for needed goods (9). Environmental impact assessments are required for big projects. Still, activists argue for more transparency and stricter protections, especially as Iran eyes new projects (like developing that significant lithium find) in ecologically sensitive areas. International trade of resources is both an opportunity and a challenge for Iran. Oil is the dominant export commodity. Iran can export >2 million barrels/day of crude oil when unconstrained, and it has historically sold to Asia (China, India, South Korea, Japan) and Europe. However, US and UN sanctions over the past decade sharply curtailed Iran’s access to markets; exports plunged after 2018, though China continues to import Iranian oil (often via intermediaries). (10) To circumvent restrictions, Iran has increasingly traded via barter deals with regional partners – for instance, swapping oil and gas with neighbours like Iraq or trading energy for goods from China and Turkey. Its natural gas exports are limited (despite huge reserves) due to sanctions and infrastructure bottlenecks – small volumes go by pipeline to Turkey and Iraq. Iran is a founding member of OPEC and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), aiming to coordinate and bolster hydrocarbon prices. Iran’s strategic geography influences its energy transit. It sits on the Strait of Hormuz, a choke point through which ~20% of global oil passes – Tehran has sometimes threatened closure, unsettling markets. (11) Domestically, an extensive pipeline network distributes oil and gas, and Iran has built pipelines to export gas to Turkey and plans to Pakistan (though the latter is stalled). The lack of LNG terminals means Iran cannot quickly ship gas globally, which is a long-term gap it wants to fix. Beyond hydrocarbons, Iran exports minerals and metals, mainly to Asia. China is a major buyer of Iranian copper, iron and semi-finished steel. Trade partners: China has emerged as Iran’s top trade partner (for oil, petrochemicals, and minerals), followed by other Asian economies; the UAE and Turkey serve as re-export hubs for Iranian goods. Before sanctions, the EU was a significant oil and Persian carpets market, but that has diminished. Iran relies on China, Russia, and Turkey to import machinery, consumer goods, and grain. Infrastructure development continues despite challenges: Iran is expanding the Chabahar port (with Indian investment) to boost mineral exports from its east and improving rail links to move bulk goods to ports. The country’s inclusion in China’s Belt and Road Initiative may further integrate its trade routes. Pipelines also feature in regional geopolitics – Iran has proposed pipelines to deliver gas to India (undersea) or deeper into Iraq/Syria, though sanctions impede financing. In sum, Iran’s trade in natural resources is marked by adaptation to sanctions (greater self-reliance and regional barter) and the search for new markets, all while maintaining a strong OPEC voice in managing oil prices. Iran’s resource sector faces an uncertain but potentially transformative future. Sanction relief (or continuation) is the most significant swing factor: if a nuclear deal emerges and sanctions are lifted, Iran could rapidly ramp up oil production and attract foreign investment into ageing oilfields and massive untapped gas fields. (12) This would boost GDP and government revenue but also bring pressure to diversify to avoid the “resource curse.” Conversely, if sanctions persist, Iran will deepen ties with countries like China and Russia, continue smuggling oil at discounts, and lean on mining and agriculture for incremental growth. The country is also eyeing a pivot to new resources. The reported lithium discovery in 2023 is seen as a future “white gold” opportunity – Iran could become a player in lithium for batteries, provided it secures extraction technology and investment. (13) Similarly, “critical minerals” like rare earth elements (needed for electronics and renewable energy) present an untapped domain; Iran’s varied geology hints at potential deposits that strategic surveys may confirm. Domestic demand trends will shape the resource mix. Iran’s young population and industrialization efforts mean rising energy needs. Yet, the government aims to reduce domestic oil consumption (through subsidy reform and replacing oil-burning power plants with gas or renewables) to export more oil. The large natural gas reserves could be used for petrochemicals, electricity, and possibly LNG exports if technology and capital become available. In fact, Iran plans to dramatically increase gas output for both domestic use (to stop winter shortages) and future export infrastructure. On the environmental front, Iran is likely to feel increasing impacts of climate change – severe droughts (like the one that shrank Lake Urmia) threaten farming and hydropower, and extreme heat strains the power grid. This may force stronger water conservation policies, investment in climate-resilient agriculture, and a slow shift toward renewable energy sources. Iran has set a goal to install several gigawatts of solar and wind capacity; these projects may accelerate if costs drop and financing can be arranged, especially to electrify remote areas and free up more fossil fuel for export. Geopolitically, Iran’s resources will keep it in a position of leverage. Global demand for oil and gas is forecast to plateau or decline by mid-century as renewable energy rises. Still, in the medium term (this decade), markets remain thirsty – Iran’s ability to supply could moderate global prices, giving it bargaining power if sanctions negotiations recur. Its integration into new blocs (e.g. SCO, a potential BRICS member) could create alternative trade frameworks for its commodities, bypassing Western-centric channels. In summary, Iran’s rich natural resource base will remain the foundation of its economy. In the coming years, efforts will be made to modernize and expand capacity (significantly if sanctions ease), diversify within the sector (more value-added petrochemicals, mining products, and possibly lithium), and mitigate environmental strains. The challenge will be leveraging these resources for sustainable development rather than short-term gain, by investing in technology, engaging with global markets on better terms, and ensuring local communities’ benefit. This balance will determine Iran’s economic resilience in the future.

Mexico is a country of wide-ranging natural wealth, from hydrocarbons under the Gulf of Mexico to rich mineral belts and fertile agricultural lands. It has significant (though declining) oil and gas reserves, extensive metallic minerals (the world’s leading silver producer, along with gold, copper, and zinc mines), vast forests, productive fisheries in two oceans, and a robust agricultural sector. While Mexico’s economy has diversified toward manufacturing and services, natural resources still contribute substantially to exports, regional employment, and energy security. The nation’s geographic diversity – mountains, deserts, coastlines, and tropics – gives rise to a broad array of resources that have shaped its development and trade relationships. Energy Resources: Mexico has been a major oil producer for decades, with resources both onshore and offshore. The majority of oil is sourced from the Gulf of Mexico (specifically the Bay of Campeche fields, such as Ku-Maloob-Zaap and Cantarell), managed by state-owned Pemex. Oil reserves are approximately 17 Tcf proven (1), and Mexico imports a significant amount of gas (primarily via pipeline from the U.S.) to meet its demand. Coal is present (especially lignite and some bituminous in Coahuila), used mostly for domestic power generation, but Mexico is not a major coal exporter. In recent years, renewables have grown: hydropower dams (like Chicoasén) are longstanding, and wind farms in Oaxaca and solar plants in the north have expanded under clean energy goals. By 2023, about 23% of Mexico’s electricity came from “clean” sources (including hydro and nuclear) (2). A notable development is Mexico’s discovery of a sizable deepwater oil province in the Gulf and the nationalization of lithium in 2022, reflecting intent to tap emerging energy resources (the lithium deposits in Sonora could be strategic for batteries, with an estimated 1.7 million tons of lithium resources. Mineral Wealth: Mexico is exceptionally rich in minerals. It is the world’s largest producer of silver – traditional mining districts like Zacatecas and Chihuahua have yielded silver for centuries. The country also ranks in the top 10 globally for gold production and has significant output of copper, lead, zinc, and iron ore. Northern states (Sonora, Chihuahua) host large gold and copper mines, while central Mexico (Zacatecas, Durango) is famous for silver. Mexico also holds 90% of the world’s known borate (boron) reserves and is a top producer of fluorspar and celestite. Non-metallic minerals are important too: Mexico exports substantial cement, limestone, and marble. In total, the mining sector is diverse – in 2022, about half of the value of mining production came from precious metals, 40% from base (non-ferrous) metals, and the rest from industrial minerals. (3) Forestry: Around one-third of Mexico’s land is forested (4) ranging from coniferous forests in the Sierra Madre to tropical jungles in the Yucatán and Chiapas. The country’s forests provide timber, resin, and other products, with major logging of pine and oak in temperate areas. States like Durango and Chihuahua are known for commercial forestry, and Mexico produces wood pulp, paper, and furniture woods. However, deforestation (often for agriculture or pasture) has been a concern – Mexico loses tens of thousands of hectares of jungle each year. (5) The government and communities manage some forests sustainably (community forestry in Oaxaca is a success story). Forestry is a smaller contributor to GDP, but in rural economies it’s meaningful and forests underpin biodiversity and carbon sequestration efforts. Fisheries: With extensive coastlines on the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean, Mexico has rich marine fisheries. The Pacific coast, especially the Gulf of California, teems with commercial species – tuna, sardines, shrimp, and squid are among top catches. The state of Sinaloa leads in Pacific fisheries (shrimp farming is also significant). In the Gulf of Mexico, fisheries include shrimp, snapper, and grouper. Mexico’s fishing industry supplies both domestic markets and exports (for example, shrimp and tuna exports to the US and Asia). Aquaculture (fish and shellfish farming) is growing as wild stocks face pressure. While not a top-tier global fishing nation, Mexico is a leading fisheries producer in the Americas, and fishing is crucial for many coastal communities. Agriculture: Mexico’s varied climates support a wide array of agriculture. In the northwest (Sonora, Sinaloa), large-scale farms produce wheat, tomatoes, vegetables and irrigated crops for export (this “breadbasket” feeds winter produce to North America). The Bajío region grows corn, sorghum, strawberries, and other crops, while tropical states (Veracruz, Chiapas) cultivate sugarcane, coffee, and tropical fruits (mangoes, bananas). Mexico is the world’s #1 producer of avocados and limes, and a dominant exporter of berries, peppers, and tomatoes to the U.S. It also leads globally in beverage crops like blue agave (for tequila). Livestock farming is significant – northern ranches raise cattle (Mexico is a top beef exporter), and there’s substantial poultry and dairy in central Mexico. Agriculture (with forestry and fishing) contributes around 3.8% of Mexico’s GDP (6) but employs about 12–13% of the workforce It’s vital for rural incomes and a source of foreign exchange through exports of high-value produce. (7) Natural resources have a mixed but noteworthy role in Mexico’s economy. Historically, oil was a pillar – in the 1980s, oil revenues underwrote a large share of the national budget. Today, oil and gas still matter: the oil sector accounts for ~4–5% of GDP and about $110 billion in export revenue in 2021 (8), representing roughly 10% of total exports. This is lower than in past decades due to the growth of manufacturing exports and a drop in oil output, but petroleum remains Mexico’s largest single export commodity (crude and refined products). The state oil company Pemex is a major employer and contributor to public finances (though heavily indebted), and regions like Campeche and Tabasco rely on the oil industry. The mining sector, while smaller (non-oil mining ~1–2% of GDP), is significant in certain regions and for exports. Mexico’s mineral exports were about $17.6 billion in 2022 (9), led by silver, gold, copper, and zinc. Mining is a key employer in rural areas of Sonora, Zacatecas, Coahuila, etc., and draws considerable foreign investment (Canadian firms, for example, operate many mines). Resource extraction has spurred the development of infrastructure like roads and power in remote areas. Agriculture, at ~3–4% of GDP, punches above its weight in trade: Mexico is a net exporter of produce and beverages (sending billions of dollars of goods to the U.S. under NAFTA/USMCA). It also underpins food security and price stability, as maize (corn) is a staple of the Mexican diet and supporting farmers is socioeconomically important. However, many small farmers struggle with productivity and drought, prompting government support via subsidies and price guarantees. One major way natural resources influence Mexico’s economy is through export earnings and the trade balance. Oil exports have long been a top foreign currency earner, but as oil export volumes fell and the country became a net importer of gasoline, the benefit lessened. Meanwhile, manufactured goods (cars, electronics) surged to ~90% of exports, diluting the share of raw resources. Still, in 2023, high oil prices led to a windfall for Pemex and helped offset the cost of importing refined fuels. Similarly, high metals prices benefit Mexican mining companies and local economies. Natural gas imports (mostly from the U.S.) have cut electricity costs and enabled industrial growth, linking resource access to broader economic activity. At a regional level, resources drive development: for example, in the Gulf coast states, the oil industry provides high-paying jobs and infrastructure (ports, refineries), whereas in states like Michoacán and Jalisco, avocado farming has created rural wealth. Tourism in some areas even ties into natural bounty – e.g. Sportfishing on Baja’s coasts or eco-tourism in jungles – blending resource use with service sectors. The Mexican government also uses resource revenue as a tool for social programs; e.g. oil income has funded welfare initiatives. Thus, while not as dominant as in some countries, natural resources remain a strategic economic asset, contributing to exports, employment, and regional development in Mexico. Mexico faces the challenge of exploiting its resources while protecting the environment and communities. Oil and mining operations have environmental impacts – there have been notorious incidents like oil spills (the Ixtoc I well blowout in 1979, and more recently smaller leaks) and mining waste spills (e.g., a 2014 sulfuric acid spill from a copper mine in Sonora) that contaminated rivers. The government mandates environmental impact assessments for major projects, but enforcement has sometimes been weak, leading to conflicts with local populations. Climate policy: Mexico has committed under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions and in 2022 updated its pledge to cut GHG 35% by 2030 (unconditional). (10) It also aims for net-zero by 2050. In practice, there’s tension: Mexico is investing in renewable energy (one of Latin America’s largest solar parks opened in Chihuahua, and wind capacity has grown in Oaxaca and Tamaulipas), yet the current administration has also promoted fossil fuels. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has emphasized energy sovereignty, supporting Pemex and the state electric utility (CFE) even if that means extending life for oil refineries and coal plants. This has slowed some private renewable projects. Still, laws like the Energy Transition Law set a target for 35% of electricity from clean sources by 2024. As of 2023, clean generation was around 23% (11), so efforts are ongoing (including new hydro renovations and a push for geothermal, where Mexico has potential). Deforestation and land use: Agricultural expansion and illegal logging have made Mexico one of the countries with significant deforestation. Policies (often in partnership with local ejidos/communities) try to incentivize reforestation and sustainable forestry. Mexico has several UNESCO biosphere reserves protecting forests (e.g., the Monarch Butterfly Reserve), and it participates in REDD+ programs to reduce emissions from deforestation. Water resources are also a concern: northern Mexico is arid, and water-intensive farming (and now mining like lithium extraction) raises sustainability issues. The government has enforced water use limits in some basins and negotiated with the U.S. on cross-border rivers as climate change brings more droughts. Community and indigenous rights: Mexico recognizes indigenous peoples’ rights to consultation (ILO Convention 169) for projects on their lands. In practice, conflicts have arisen – for example, indigenous Yaqui communities in Sonora protested over water diversion for mining, and Maya communities in Yucatán have raised concerns about a planned large-scale solar farm and the Tren Maya project affecting the environment. Mining projects in states like Guerrero and Chiapas have sometimes led to social conflict and even violence, prompting calls for stronger safeguards and benefit-sharing with locals. On the other hand, some communities do welcome projects that bring jobs. The balance is evolving: recently, a Mexican court suspended a mining project in Puebla due to lack of adequate indigenous consultation, indicating the growing legal weight of community voices. Regulatory landscape: In 2013–2014, Mexico enacted a major Energy Reform that opened the oil, gas, and power sectors to private and foreign investment after decades of state monopoly. (12) This led to new oil blocks auctioned to companies like Shell and BP and contracts for private renewable energy generators. However, since 2018, policy has shifted – AMLO’s government halted new oil bid rounds and passed reforms favoring CFE in electricity dispatch. A 2023 reform of the Mining Law reduced concession terms and put stricter environmental rules, (13) aiming to prevent speculation and require water sustainability in mining. While intended to protect resources and communities, some investors see it as increasing uncertainty. The government also nationalized lithium by law, creating a state company for lithium (LitioMx) and limiting private extraction of this strategic resource. Environmentalists have welcomed measures like these and the cancellation of a mega airport partly to protect a lake, but critics worry about transparency and efficiency of state-led projects. In summary, Mexico’s policies seek to ensure resources benefit the nation (resource nationalism is strong) while gradually improving environmental oversight. Implementation is key – from reducing gas flaring and refinery emissions to enforcing mine remediation and boosting renewables integration. Public awareness of environmental issues is rising, as seen in protests against pollution and the demand for climate action from youth movements. Mexico’s challenge will be to strengthen its regulatory institutions so that economic development from natural resources does not come at the cost of irreparable environmental damage or community marginalization. Mexico’s natural resources figure prominently in its trade profile, though overshadowed in value by manufactured exports. Oil exports traditionally went almost entirely to the United States; even today the U.S. Gulf Coast is the main buyer of Mexican crude (Maya blend heavy crude). However, with the U.S. itself producing more oil, Mexico has diversified slightly – exporting some crude to Europe and Asia when opportunities arise. Paradoxically, Mexico imports a large volume of refined fuel from the U.S., especially gasoline, because its own refineries can’t meet domestic demand. This energy trade across the border is facilitated by a dense network of pipelines (for oil products and natural gas) and maritime tankers. Recent infrastructure moves include building a new refinery (Dos Bocas) and upgrading others to reduce fuel imports and process more of its own crude. Meanwhile, pipelines like Los Ramones and cross-border connectors have made the U.S. the source of ~70% of Mexico’s natural gas supply in 2022, (14) linking the two countries’ energy markets closely. In mining, Mexico is a major player in global supply chains: it exports raw and refined silver to markets like India and electronics industries worldwide; gold primarily to refineries in the U.S. and Switzerland; and copper concentrates to smelters (some domestically and in Asia). Trade agreements (USMCA, and various FTAs with Europe and Asia) generally allow minerals to flow with low tariffs. The U.S. relies on Mexico for certain minerals – for instance, fluorspar (for chemical industries) and graphite are imported from Mexico to the U.S. (15) Conversely, Mexico imports some mineral inputs it lacks (like potash fertilizer, or steel coal). Supply chain integration is evident in sectors like automotive: Mexican mines provide metals, which go into parts manufactured domestically, which are then exported as cars. Agricultural trade is heavily intertwined with NAFTA/USMCA partners. Mexico exports billions of dollars of produce (vegetables, fruits) and beer to the U.S., and imports large quantities of yellow corn, soybeans, and grains from U.S. farmers for its livestock sector. This exchange has made Mexico one of the top export markets for U.S. agriculture and vice versa. Additionally, Mexico exports specialty crops globally – for example, it’s a top exporter of sugar and coffee to the EU and of avocados to Europe and Asia. Trade infrastructure like cold storage at border crossings and the port of Veracruz (for tropical crop exports) supports this flow. The 2020 USMCA maintained zero tariffs on ag trade but introduced sanitary standards that Mexico works to comply with to keep access. A current issue is Mexico’s ban on genetically modified corn for human consumption, which may affect imports from the U.S. and is being negotiated. Fisheries exports include shrimp (to U.S., Europe) and tuna (often processed domestically then exported). Coastal states benefit from trade via seaports like Mazatlán and Veracruz, which handle seafood shipments. Energy infrastructure is positioning Mexico as a potential transit hub as well. The government has floated plans for LNG export terminals on the Pacific (to ship U.S. gas to Asia via Mexico) and a gas pipeline connecting to markets in Central America. Mexico already hosts the end of the Pan-American oil pipeline system (the Tapline) and the massive Cactus-Reynosa gas pipeline that feeds into Texas. Ceyhan – sorry, (Ceyhan is Turkey; here, Coatzacoalcos and Salina Cruz) – The country even has an isthmus rail/pipe corridor project (Trans-Isthmus) to move oil and goods between the Gulf and Pacific, leveraging its geography for global trade. Major trade partners: The United States is overwhelmingly number one, given proximity and NAFTA – it receives ~80% of Mexico’s total exports. For resources, the U.S. buys most of Mexico’s oil (historically) and mining output, and supplies most of Mexico’s natural gas and gasoline. Canada also imports Mexican minerals (and Canadian firms invest in Mexican mines). Other significant partners include China (Mexico sells some oil and minerals to China; China sells Mexico machinery and increasingly invests in sectors like lithium), and Europe (which imports some Mexican oil, tequila, and produce, and in turn is a source of investment and technology). Within Latin America, Mexico exports refined fuels to Central America and imports some agricultural commodities from South America. Trade dynamics are also shaped by policy shifts: the 2013 Energy Reform allowed private companies to export oil and gas for the first time in decades (before, only Pemex could). Some foreign oil companies that won exploration blocks may eventually export oil if they produce successfully. However, the current government’s nationalist stance means Pemex regained a dominant role in exports. Similarly, mining export growth might slow if regulatory burdens rise, though high commodity prices will encourage continued output. In summary, Mexico’s natural resource trade is characterized by deep integration with North America, a mix of imports and exports in energy (export crude, import fuels/gas), strong agricultural export performance, and an attractive mining sector for global markets. Infrastructure – from pipelines and ports to highways – is continually being developed or upgraded to streamline this trade, while policy aims to maximize the value Mexico gains (for instance, via refining oil domestically rather than exporting crude, or requiring local purchases in mining). Mexico’s natural resource sectors are poised for both opportunities and challenges ahead. Oil and gas production is at a crossroads: legacy oil fields are depleting, yet Mexico has untapped potential in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the recently discovered Ixachi onshore gas field and Sakakemang (if developed). The government’s strategy is to bolster Pemex with investment to slightly increase oil output (targeting ~2 million barrels per day) while using new refinery capacity to end gasoline imports. In the next 5–10 years, we may see Pemex partnering with more private firms (out of necessity for capital and tech) despite the current political hesitance – especially if oil prices are high and there’s urgency to replace declining fields. The Sakarya-like gas find in the Gulf of Mexico is not yet in hand for Mexico, but exploration continues and any major discovery would be a game-changer. Also, by 2025 the large Deer Park refinery (jointly owned with Shell in Texas) and the new Dos Bocas refinery are expected to be fully operational, potentially making Mexico a net exporter of some refined fuels. Conversely, global trends toward decarbonization put a question mark on long-term oil demand. Mexico’s heavy reliance on oil revenue could be further alleviated by its growing manufacturing base, but regions dependent on oil (Tabasco, Campeche) will need economic diversification as the world transitions to electric vehicles and renewable energy. Mexico is well positioned to benefit from the EV supply chain shift: it has announced plans for EV battery factories and lithium processing in Sonora (leveraging the lithium deposit). By investing in downstream industries for lithium (battery production) and copper (for wiring and components), Mexico could turn its resources into industrial growth. The creation of a state lithium company suggests government intent to control this “resource of the future,” but successful exploitation will require partnerships for technology. Renewable energy outlook is bright in Mexico: it has some of the world’s highest solar irradiance in Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts and excellent wind corridors (Oaxaca’s Tehuantepec Isthmus is world-class). If policy shifts to encourage more private investment (which may happen under a different administration post-2024), there could be a renewable boom. Already, meeting the 40% by 2030 renewables target (16) will drive installation of new wind/solar farms and grid upgrades. This creates a new “natural resource” opportunity – abundant clean energy – which Mexico could even export (there are proposals to send solar power via HVDC lines into the U.S. or wind power to Baja’s grid). Mining future: Mexico will likely remain a top metals producer. The global push for critical minerals (e.g., copper for electrification, lithium for batteries) means Mexican mines and unexplored areas will be in focus. The government’s tighter mining laws might slow new permits, but also encourage maximizing existing sites. Expect more exploration in underexplored regions (lithium in clay deposits in Sonora beyond the main find, rare earth elements in Baja California’s deposits, and continued gold/silver finds e.g. in Oaxaca’s emerging mines). Environmental and community scrutiny of mining will increase, prompting companies to adopt better practices and benefit-sharing to secure social license. Agriculture and climate: Mexico’s agricultural future must contend with climate change – higher temperatures and water stress, especially in the north, could reduce yields of water-intensive crops. This is pushing innovation in water-saving irrigation, drought-resistant seed varieties, and shifting crop patterns. Mexico might expand greenhouse farming (already used for tomatoes/peppers) to adapt to climate extremes. The country is also well placed to grow crops for biofuels (like agave for bioethanol or jatropha for biodiesel) if policies favor them, potentially creating new resource markets. Agricultural exports will remain strong if Mexico continues to capitalize on off-season production for Northern markets, though it must manage soil health and competition for land (urbanization is eating into farmland around booming cities). On the environmental front, Mexico is likely to take a more active role. Popular sentiment and international pressure could result in stronger enforcement of environmental laws. We may see higher penalties for oil spills, a phase-out of fuel oil burning in power plants (benefiting air quality), and possibly the closure of older coal plants as gas and renewables fill the gap. The country’s vast biodiversity (one of the world’s megadiverse nations) might spur growth in eco-tourism and conservation jobs, integrating natural resource preservation with economic benefits. Geopolitically, Mexico’s resource sector could benefit from “near-shoring” and shifting supply chains. For instance, as the U.S. and allies seek to rely less on Chinese minerals, Mexico could be a preferred source given the trade agreement and proximity – we might see investments in Mexican mining of graphite, lithium, rare earths, etc., with processing facilities built in North America (including Mexico). Energy security concerns in the region mean Mexico’s role as a gas transit route (moving U.S. gas south or potentially Venezuelan gas if that market opens) might grow. Mexico has even discussed building a gas pipeline to the Yucatán and on to Central America, exporting its excess U.S.-sourced gas further – such projects could materialize in the 2030s, making Mexico a regional energy hub. In short, Mexico’s natural resource future will involve modernizing traditional sectors (making oil, mining, and agriculture more efficient and sustainable) and embracing new opportunities (renewables, lithium, and possibly hydrogen production from abundant solar). Policy stability and investment in technology and infrastructure will be key to harnessing these resources for inclusive growth. If managed well, Mexico can continue to reduce its historical over-reliance on oil while ensuring its rich array of natural resources contributes to long-term prosperity and environmental resilience.

Title: ‘People avoid Deansgrange’: Roadworks plan angers south Dublin community

Full Content:
Residents, politicians and members of the business community in Deansgrange have sharply criticised a €12.5 million roadworks scheme which they said has brought the south Dublin suburb to a halt for the second time in as many years. At a public meeting in Bakers Corner on Thursday night, representatives of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and its contractor Clonmel Enterprises were repeatedly heckled as they sought to outline the works schedule for the two-year project. Opening the meeting, William Winters, resident engineer in the council’s active travel section, said the scheme – Phase One of the Dún Laoghaire Central Active Travel Scheme – having gone through public consultation and a vote by councillors was “now an approved scheme, so this meeting is about the construction stage”. However, Mr Winters was roundly heckled and a number of people questioned the design including closure of left hand slipways at junctions, the cost of the project, the method of public consultation and traffic light sequencing at Bakers Corner which they claimed allowed just three cars per direction, through the junction at a time. A number of speakers said congestion had built up extensively in surrounding suburbs and people could not drive out of their housing estates while some vehicles were rat-running. Many speakers complained of poor signage, a lack of yellow boxes on the roads, safety measures for children and the elderly and the absence of night-time and weekend working on the project. The scheme involves the building of segregated cycling and walking facilities on roads around Dún Laoghaire. Over the next two years work will take place on Kill Avenue, Mounttown Road Upper and Lower and Glenageary Road Upper. It is also proposed to install enhanced bus priority along Kill Avenue up to the Bakers Corner junction and improve landscaping. Niall McElwaine, a director of Clonmel Enterprises which is carrying out the construction work, told the meeting the company had a job to do and was carrying it out in a structured way. “In terms of you not wanting it – we are only the contractors here,” he said. Earlier, local businesses told The Irish Times they were particularly aggrieved about the road works, which involve redesigning junctions over a wide area between Bakers Corner and Killiney, follow almost two years of disruption on Deansgrange Road. Rachel Twomey general manager of SuperValu which employs 100 full- and part-time staff told The Irish Times most people understood the imperative for active travel measures. But she accused the council of failing to understand the community it was serving. “They can say people should do their big shop somewhere else like Cornelscourt or Blackrock and just crush us. But they have not considered families taking children to sports in other communities after school. These communities around south Dublin are interconnected. They go one place for hockey, another for swimming and another for tennis, somewhere else for GAA and football,” she said. In relation to the impact on her business, she said “the big shop is gone, gone gone”. Declan Fitzgerald of Nexus Accounting on Deansgrange Road said his firm owned the building which featured a number of retail units at ground floor. He said one of these, a flower shop, had handed back the keys due to business disruption, while he himself was still in talks to the council over compensation for land taken fronting Deansgrange Road. He said businesses in the area were extremely frustrated. Tom Kelly who runs Graft Coffee in the Deansgrange Business park said he had not counted the loss of custom to his business but trade was visibly down. He said it regularly takes 30 minutes and more to travel the last 800 metres to his coffee shop, since changes were put in place. “People avoid Deansgrange,” he said. Local Fine Gael councillor Maurice Dockrell also cited the closure of the flower shop which he said was due to “the prolonged roadworks, combined with ongoing building works [which] have made traffic conditions unbearable.

After it delivered another record quarter, all eyes will be on Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) announcements at its annual GPU Technology Conference in March. Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell artificial intelligence platform at last year’s conference — known as the GTC — which has now “successfully ramped up” large-scale production and is “achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. Demand for the chips, which faced production delays due to design flaws and overheating issues, is “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models, according to Huang. On the company’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings call, Huang said he will discuss the company’s next AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, its next-generation AI platform, Vera Rubin, and its plans for following products at the conference. During the company’s earnings call in May, Huang announced that Nvidia already had another chip coming after Blackwell, and that the company is “on a one-year rhythm.” The following month, Huang announced Blackwell Ultra and the Rubin platform during an appearance at COMPUTEX in Taiwan. During the call with analysts on Wednesday, Huang said Nvidia has “some really exciting things to share” at the GTC about enterprise and agentic AI, reasoning models, and robotics. The upcoming developers conference will be “another positive catalyst to help solidify the performance advantages of Blackwell and lay a framework for continued AI spending, particularly on the inference side,” Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) analysts said in a note on Thursday. Despite surpassing revenue and guidance expectations, Nvidia’s shares fell on Thursday as some investors were left unimpressed by its results. However, Nvidia is expected to “get the market excited about everything in the product pipeline,” at the GTC next month, John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in post-earnings comments shared with Quartz. Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, shared similar sentiments, saying Nvidia’s “real story is its rapid cadence of innovation,” in comments shared with Quartz. “With GTC around the corner, I expect further product announcements to build on today’s momentum.” The GTC takes place between March 17 and 21, and Huang will deliver his keynote address on March 18.

Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: bgandg.com/NVO. Case Details The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate.

("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). Merck investors have until April 14, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

The Portnoy Law Firm can provide a complimentary case evaluation and discuss investors’ options for pursuing claims to recover their losses. According to the complaint, the defendants provided investors with material information regarding Merck’s projected $11 billion in revenue from Gardasil sales by 2030. Their statements expressed confidence in Merck’s ability to drive demand through consumer activation and education efforts, emphasizing the benefits of Gardasil and targeting eligible populations for vaccination. As a result, they issued optimistic reports and forecasts about Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced that it would no longer meet its long-forecasted $11 billion in Gardasil sales by 2030. The company revealed it would halt shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants attributed this decision to an overinflation of channel inventories, citing that demand in China had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this announcement, Merck’s common stock plummeted. After closing at $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, the stock price dropped to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025—a decline of more than 9% in just one day.

Title: 'As good as it gets': Why one analyst says this is the peak for Nvidia
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-outlook-q4-quarter-earnings-ai-blackwell-tech-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-27T20:20:35Z
Full Content:
After gaining 1,776% in five years, one analyst says Nvidia looks like it's hit a peak. That's according to Gil Luria, a tech analyst at DA Davidson. Luria wrote on Thursday after the chip titan reported earnings results that growth is set for a slowdown. "This is as good as it gets for Nvidia," he told CNBC on Thursday, the same day the stock saw a sharp decline of as much as 8%. Shares finished the day down 6% after the company's fourth-quarter earnings disappointed, dragging the tech-heavy Nasdaq 3% lower. For Luria, the concern is not whether Nvidia is executing on its strategy — because it is, with the company's fiscal year 2025 revenue more than doubling year-over-year to $130.5 billion. Instead, the concern is that Nvidia's growth is going to continue to decelerate. Clocking in at 78%, Nvidia's year-over-year fourth-quarter revenue growth was the company's slowest quarter of growth in nearly two years. Luria told Business Insider about some of the obstacles he sees ahead for the chip maker. First, spending for Nvidia's GPU chips by its largest customers, like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Amazon, has likely peaked, even when considering massive increases to their capital expenditures guidance last month. "Their big customers increased their spend the most into Q4 as they ever have and probably ever will," Luria said. "Two of their three largest customers have said capex will be flat into the first half of the year." That's a big deal considering just over one-third of Nvidia's revenue comes from just three customers. This concern plays into the idea that there will eventually be an oversupply of Nvidia's GPU chips and waning demand for compute, especially as companies start to scrutinize the return on investment in AI. "Despite demand in the near-term continuing to be strong, we still believe a decline in demand for NVIDIA compute is inevitable as customers begin to scrutinize their ROI on AI compute," Luria explained. China is another big concern, with Luria arguing that even without the Trump administration's tariffs, Nvidia is facing increased competition. "There will be more restrictions on sales of chips to China so those sales are going to be under pressure," Luria said. In his earnings update note, Luria highlighted that Chinese labs are reportedly shifting their inference workloads to GPU chips made by Huawei, "underscoring the growing competiveness of compute in the region." But perhaps the most important factor is the see-sawing of Nvidia's profit margins due to its accelerated cadence of releasing a new GPU chip every year. "Everytime they get to 75% gross margins, a new product is going to drag it back down to the low 70s," Luria said. Nvidia's profit margin guidance was a weak spot in its latest earnings report, with the company expecting a gross profit margin of about 71% in the first quarter as it continues to work through the ramp in production of its Blackwell GPUs. Even with the tepid outlook, Luria isn't bearish on Nvidia. The analyst rates Nvidia at "Neutral" with a $135 price target. Shares of Nvidia initially see-sawed between gains and losses after it released its fourth-quarter earnings results, but the stock eventually moved decisively lower in Thursday's trading session, down about 4% to $126.49.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Predicts the Next Big Thing After ‘Agentic A.I’

A.I. agents may be all the rage right now, but Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is already looking beyond the hype. A.I.’s next phase will be “physical A.I.,” he said during Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call yesterday (Feb. 26). Physical A.I. is a form of A.I. systems that can interact directly with the real world and encompasses products like autonomous vehicles and robots. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. “Now is the beginning of the agentic A.I. era, and you hear a lot of people talking about it. Then, there’s physical A.I. after that,” Huang told analysts. He went on to explain, “They can’t just understand the meaning of words and languages, but they have to understand the meaning of the world, friction and inertia, object permanence and cause and effect.” To this effect, Nvidia in January unveiled a platform of “world models,” which attempt to simulate real-world environments. Known as Cosmos, the new platform promises to advance the training of physical A.I. systems by providing highly realistic virtual worlds. Self-driving cars, for example, could be tested across various simulated weather conditions, while robotics companies could examine the safety of their products in different scenarios. Cosmos has already been adopted by robotics companies like 1X and Neura Robotics and autonomous vehicle makers like Waabi and Wayve. The platform is also working with Uber (UBER) as it explores robotaxi products, Nvidia’s chief financial officer Colette Kress said yesterday. “Just as language foundation models have revolutionized language A.I., Cosmos is a physical A.I. to revolutionize robotics,” she added. “World models” is a concept picking up steam in A.I. Last year, Fei-Fei Li, a renowned computer scientist and leading figure in A.I. research, founded World Labs, which looks to infuse A.I. with “spatial intelligence” that understands and interacts with the real world. The startup raised $230 million last year and unveiled an early glimpse of its progress in generating virtual 3D scenes from 2D images. For the time being, A.I. developers are heavily focusing on agents, with leaders like OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) emphasizing autonomous, action-taking features in recent A.I. releases. Nvidia is doing just fine in the agentic A.I. era. The company’s quarterly revenue surged 78 percent year-over-year to $39.3 billion, the vast majority of which came from its data center business. Profit during the quarter jumped 80 percent to $22 billion. Nvidia’s physical A.I. dreams remain a minuscule part of its business, with its automotive and robotics division accounting for less than 2 percent of the company’s total revenue during the November-January quarter. This share will rise in the future. “Someday, there will be 1 billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be robotic cars,” Huang told analysts, adding that Nvidia will “be improving them using an A.I. factory” powered by physical A.I. Despite exceeding Wall Street’s expectations on both revenue and net income, some investors were spooked by Nvidia’s underwhelming gross margin outlook. Nvidia’s stock is down by more than 3 percent today. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience. But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.

Title: Google just had layoffs, and Googlers are using a Google Doc to track who got cut

Google this week cut employees across several of its units, including Cloud, ad sales, and Trust & Safety. Google staffers have circulated an internal Google doc tracking company job cuts, crowdsourced from internal memos and employee testimonies. Employees say Google has been making rolling cuts over the past few months, though many were much smaller and more surgical than the large cuts Google made in January 2023. Across the tech industry, companies such as Amazon and Microsoft that conducted sweeping layoffs a few years ago have been making recurring smaller reductions. A Google spokesperson said fewer than 200 roles were affected across the teams mentioned in the document. "Our teams have continued to make changes to operate more efficiently, remove layers, and ensure they are set up for long-term success," the spokesperson said. "This work is ongoing as we continue to invest in our company's biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead." The crowdsourced document, reviewed by Business Insider, said that several teams were informed of cuts this week, including an unknown number of employees in Google's ad sales team for the Americas Large Customer Sales group, which serves the company's bigger advertising clients. The document cited a memo announcing that the cuts were made to streamline and reduce layers. The document also said that at least 25 people were cut from the Bard EngProd team, an engineering team for the Bard AI product, which has since been rebranded as Gemini. It said an unknown number of employees were cut from the Trust & Safety group, citing a memo describing some jobs as being "redeployed." A spokesperson said the company intended to grow the Trust & Safety team despite the latest eliminations. For most teams, the specific number of employees cut is unknown. Several teams within Google's Cloud unit also had job cuts this week, including the Threat Intelligence Group, Scaled Customer Engineering, Google Cloud Platform Support, Go-To-Market, and Looker groups, the document said. Bloomberg earlier reported some details of the Cloud layoffs. Within Google, employees have often crowdsourced documents to share information such as which teams got hit with job cuts or how much money employees of different levels and locations make. Employees at other tech companies, such as Amazon, have circulated similar crowdsourced documents to share information about job cuts. Last month, Google offered voluntary buyouts for staff in its Pixel hardware and Android division, BI previously reported. Have a tip?

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) finished the fiscal year by delivering record revenue and outlook above expectations for the fourth quarter — and more than doubling its full-year revenue from the previous year. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s full-year revenue grew 114% year over year to a record $130.5 billion. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement, adding that demand for the new chips is “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. According to Nvidia’s 10-K filing, just three anonymous customers made up more than 30% of total revenue for the fiscal year ended in January. “Direct Customer A” accounted for 12% of total revenue, while Direct Customers B and C each represented 11%, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Direct Customer B made up 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, the filing said. All of the sales “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” according to the filing. For the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia had reported revenue of $35.1 billion — 36% of which came from three unnamed customers. For the three months ended in October, Customers A, B, and C each accounted for 12% of Nvidia’s quarterly revenue, according to the company’s Form 10-Q. The filing also showed that, in the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to Customers B and C each made up 11% of revenue, while a Customer D accounted for 12% of revenue. Although the chipmaker will not disclose the companies, its top customers could likely include Alphabet (GOOGL+0.12%), Amazon (AMZN+0.25%), Meta (META+0.42%), Microsoft (MSFT0.00%), and Tesla (TSLA+3.07%).

Title: MRK LAWSUIT ALERT: Levi & Korsinsky Notifies Merck & Co., Inc. Investors of a Class Action Lawsuit and Upcoming Deadline

February 27, 2025 12:44 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Merck & Co., Inc. ("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=132384&wire=3 MRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

Title: Volusion

Full Content:
Volusion differentiates itself from other services in the crowded e-commerce field by offering many useful tools and features, including an easy-to-use website builder, rich tutorials that walk you through its many options, and tight Google search integration. However, Volusion's unusual annual revenue limits can potentially hamper your success. If your business fits within Volusion’s relatively narrow vision, the shopping platform could be just what you need. However, you should check out Shopify and Wix Stores, our Editors' Choice winners, if you want e-commerce without revenue caps. Volusion has four tiers: Personal, Professional, Business, and Prime. The entry-level Personal costs $35 per month and is suited for single e-entrepreneurs. It lets you create one staff account, house 100 products in your store, and contact customer support via email or live chat should you have questions. Unfortunately, Volusion has annual revenue limits (or what they call Gross Merchandise Volume) across all its plans. The maximum GMV is $50K. The Professional plan is $79 per month, which increases the number of staff accounts to five and the product limit to 5,000 products. However, you're still limited to live chat and email support. The other features include phone orders, customer ratings and reviews, abandoned cart reports, and customer relationship management. The GMV tops out at $100k. The Business tier is a pricey $299 per month. This plan offers unlimited product inventory, 15 staff accounts, and phone support. Additional features include API access, batch order processing, and creating a customer loyalty plan. The maximum GMV is $400K. With the Prime plan, you get unlimited GMV, unlimited products, unlimited staff accounts, and VIP high-priority support. It unlocks lower rates on additional Volusion services, such as a client success manager, PayPal integration, and a premium checkout. The cost? You must contact Volusion's sales department to let the representatives know your projected GMV so they can make a quote based on that revenue. Volusion’s pricing page mentions you can contact its sales team to chat about a potential custom pricing option for any tier. It’s good to know that you may not be locked into those specific annual limits, but we don't know how flexible it gets. You can also sign up for a 14-day free trial; no credit card is required. Volusion also has zero transaction fees if you use Volusion Payments Powered by Stripe, regardless of tier. Alternate payment gateways cause Volusion to charge 1.25% for Personal, 0.65% for Professional, 0.35% for Business, and custom percentages for Prime. Volusion has unlimited bandwidth across the board. Volusion’s plans aren't too different from Shopify's, though the former's Personal tier is a bit more expensive than the latter’s Basic tier ($35 per month versus $29 per month). In addition, Shopify has no annual revenue limits and lets you enjoy unlimited inventory with each plan. Wix Stores' pricing also starts at $29 per month and has 24/7 customer support. After creating an account, you arrive on your dashboard. Volusion does a lot of signposting to steer you toward designing your online storefront before uploading products. A colorful, easy-to-navigate online store is critical to selling your wares, so the handholding is a welcome addition. Volusion offers 24 store templates, which is low compared with Wix Stores (it has more than 900!). The template breaks down your potential website into “blocks,” which can be moved up or down. There are many editing options within each block, too. Volusion uses an intuitive system that lets you easily know if you can edit a store element; just hover your cursor over an area and get to work if it turns green. Overall, it was a pleasurable site-editing experience that let me add images and text and make a site color profile entirely different from the template. I would’ve liked to see more active tutorials in the site editor. Before launching the site designer, you can click the Learn More tab to receive instructions. Essentially, it's a blog post that runs you through how to build a site and includes a four-minute tutorial video. While this is appreciated, there’s no guidance while you're in the site editor. Volusion’s dashboard keeps all its options in the toolbar at the top of the screen, straying away from the common left-hand side navigation we see in many other e-commerce dashboards. There, you manage placed orders, access customer management, add products to your inventory, and view detailed business reports. Adding products in the Advanced Info section is easy and starts with clicking the Inventory tab. You can add item images and the information your customers would like to know about a product, such as price and weight. If you get confused or need help, there is a question mark next to each field that you can click on for more info. You can also set stock for products, and related alerts for when the inventory runs low. It’s a nice feature that other services sometimes paywall behind their pricier tiers. Ecwid, for example, only lets Business and Unlimited subscribers access basic inventory tracking. Volusion has so many options that it can be a little overwhelming. Although seasoned e-commerce pros might feel at home with SEO, discount management, and other features, newcomers may walk away scratching their heads. On the bright side, these features also have question marks next to their fields, explaining what each one does. Volusion has a few interesting marketing features, like its Google integration. You can create pay-per-click (PPC) ads that leverage Google’s search engine results so your online shop can appear when users are browsing via certain keywords. Similarly, your store can integrate with Google Shopping, so your items can appear at the top of the search when Google users search for certain products. Volusion also has a built-in rewards program called My Rewards. It’s a points system you customize by setting a certain threshold on how much a customer can accumulate points, redeem points, and when those points expire. Volusion uses a tier-based customer support model. Sadly, you can only access email and 24/7 live chat with the Personal and Professional plans. To get a person on the phone, you must subscribe to the Business and Prime tiers. Those phone lines are open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. CT, Monday through Friday. Paywalling phone support is frustrating. Although a 24/7 chat option is good for e-shop owners who work unconventional hours, you should be able to call them at least during business hours if you’re paying a company $79 a month for a service. Shopify and Wix Stores offer 24/7 phone and chat support across all tiers. A flexible website editor, good marketing tools, and useful tutorials make Volusion a worthwhile e-commerce platform. That said, annual revenue limits constrict its appeal. Entrepreneurs looking to break into the e-commerce world should also explore our Editors' Choice winners, Shopify and Wix Stores, which offer 24/7 customer support and more room to grow.

Title: Nvidia shows Big Tech's AI spending spree is still going strong

Time Published: 2025-02-27T15:59:10Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) delivered another record quarter and raised outlook on strong demand for its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, confirming that Big Tech’s big spending on AI will continue, analysts said. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 — a 78% increase from the previous year, and above the consensus of $38.1 billion. Fiscal first quarter guidance was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. “It was logical to be concerned about the ramping of Blackwell, but we have now successfully ramped Blackwell,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a post-earnings appearance on CNBC (CMCSA+0.95%). Huang added that he believes Nvidia is “successfully behind the air pocket” in demand over which investors raised concerns as customers transitioned from Hopper to Blackwell. “We’re going to have a good quarter next quarter. And we’ve got a fairly good pipeline of demand for Blackwell,” Huang said. Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that “[t]he supply chain should continue to improve,” and that they “see no signs of demand issues,” for Blackwell. Ahead of earnings results, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up Blackwell production — despite shockwaves from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. “The recent setback in Nvidia’s stock from DeepSeek and the narrative that AI demand would decline proved unfounded as customers continue to race to scale AI infrastructure, largely with Nvidia chips,” Sean Sun, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said in comments shared with Quartz. Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, also said he doesn’t think DeepSeek will “clobber demand for Nvidia’s data centre chips” in comments shared with Quartz. The chipmaker’s expectations for the current fiscal year “look to be about right which combined with the good visibility that I think the company has means that there will be few surprises this year,” Windsor said. Meanwhile, concerns by investors over Nvidia’s top customers designing their own custom chips “appear overdone,” Sun said. “Nvidia’s ecosystem advantages and software stack remain formidable barriers to entry.” On its post-earnings call, Nvidia said the reasoning AI models over which firms such as OpenAI and Google are competing “can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences.” The company “is uniquely positioned to capture this exponential growth,” Sun said.

Title: Nvidia's strong earnings can't keep its stock from sliding — along with other chipmakers

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) and other semiconductor stocks gave up premarket gains and fell in early Thursday Wall Street trading. While the AI chipmaker yesterday posted earnings that surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, they may have fallen short of the complete blowout that some investors had anticipated. Rival chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.16%), Micron (MU+1.00%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.12%), and Intel (INTC+2.40%) also declined, shedding pre-opening gains. “This is telling you more about the state/sentiment of the market, and [its] volatile nature ... than it tells you about how Nvidia is doing in our eyes,” Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney said before the open. “These results mean a lot for the stock market and the AI ecosystem.” Nvidia’s strong order book for its newest models is an indication that its customers are continuing to invest in artificial intelligence, and may lay to rest concerns that DeepSeek’s recently unveiled, cheaper AI model has prompted companies to defer or reduce their spending plans. “CEO commentary suggests Blackwell demand is ‘amazing,’ supported by strong top-line results,” Gabelli Funds’ John Belton said. “It should be a positive read for AI demand and the investment cycle.” Elsewhere, TSMC (TSM-1.62%) stock fell in Taipei on Thursday. Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said the chip foundry would need government permission for any overseas joint venture, but there are no restrictions on making the most-advanced chips overseas other than for China, Reuters reported. The Trump administration has pushed to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations or at least operate them as a joint venture. The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. The nation continues to negotiate with the U.S. to seek the best conditions possible for Taiwanese companies under possible new American tariffs, Kuo told the news agency. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Title: Goldman Sach says it's just following the law as it strips out references to DEI

Time Published: 2025-02-27T15:30:06Z
Full Content:
Goldman Sachs tamped down the diversity language in its annual report as DEI efforts come under fire from the Trump administration. The bank also said "aspirational hiring goals" it set five years ago expire this year without saying whether it planned to set new goals. Goldman's 2024 annual report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, referenced diversity relating to human capital just three times, versus 14 in the 2023 report and 16 times in the 2022 report. The Wall Street bank also eliminated a section of the report previously titled "Diversity and Inclusion," its hiring breakdown by race and gender and its diverse hiring goals by race and gender. Earlier this year, Goldman dropped a policy requiring companies it advises on IPOs to have at least two women directors. Goldman isn't alone. The $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock this week also cut mentions of its "three pillar DEI strategy" in its annual report, as well as a breakout of its employee demographics by race and gender. It also amended the metrics used to determine borrowing costs for a $4.4 billion credit facility which was previously tied to its efficacy in boosting internal DEI targets. The changes come as President Trump cracks down on DEI. In January, he invoked directed the Department of Justice to investigate DEI policies, prohibiting private organizations from instituting such initiatives in employment practices related to federal contracts. In a statement, Goldman CEO David Solomon cited changes to the law. "We have made certain adjustments to reflect developments in the law in the US," he said. "Our people are a powerful example of that and that's why we will continue to focus on the importance of attracting and retaining diverse, exceptional talent." Goldman said in the report that it still believes in a diverse workforce and would "continue to develop programs consistent with our fundamental commitment to inclusive merit-based promotion and compliance with the law." The bank's 2023 report set goals to hire of 50% women analysts and associates, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the UK. In 2023, it also broke down its workforce by race and gender, saying its analyst and associate hires included 49% women professionals, 9% Black professionals and 13% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 15% Black professionals in the UK. Also gone are mentions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or HBCUs. In the 2023 report, Goldman said it would seek to double the number of campus hires in the US recruited from HBCUs in 2025 relative to 2020.What's more, a breakdown of the firm's aspirational goals for diverse hiring is also missing. For Goldman, DEI has historically been framed as a business imperative. In its 2022 annual report, the firm stated that "diversity at all levels" was "essential to our sustainability" and cited efforts to increase representation among women and underrepresented groups. At the time, the firm touted stats, such as one where it said approximately 57% of Goldman's board was diverse by race, gender, or sexual orientation. Even so, its track record on DEI has come under fire for other reasons. Last year, reporting from The Wall Street Journal found that numerous senior women at the bank felt it hadn't done enough to support their career prospects or advancement, and was still heavily male-dominated.

Title: A new public policy agenda has a vision for “local news for the people”

What would a local media system that prioritizes working and middle classes over corporate profits and the interests of billionaires look like? A new public policy agenda released this week has some ideas. The Media Power Collaborative, which released its policy framework on Tuesday, describes itself as an organizing space for media workers and their allies in research, activism, and education. The collaborative grew out of a peer networking group — now known as the News Futures collective — and is part of the media reform group Free Press. If you remember the much-discussed Roadmap for Local News that argued that the future of local news is “civic information,” this is the same crowd. The local news industry, as Nieman Lab readers well know, has been devastated by ad revenue losses, layoffs, and profit-driven corporate ownership over the past couple of decades. Over that time, local newspapers have shrunk faster than a new crop of local news sites and nonprofit newsrooms have been able to grow. Through the policy agenda, policy tracker, and a new network of regional coalitions, the Media Power Collaborative wants to push the public policy conversation toward support for some of the more community-minded local media that’s emerged to fill that gap. RELATED ARTICLEThe future of local news is “civic information,” not “declining legacy systems,” says new reportLaura Hazard OwenFebruary 2, 2023There’s a lot of overlap between the Media Power Collaborative and organizations like Rebuild Local News, which has its own policy menu and legislation tracker, and other media industry groups. But unlike, say, the News Media Alliance — which replaced the Newspaper Association of America and primarily represents commercial news publishers — the Media Power Collaborative and its aligned groups are orientated around meeting local information needs. In some communities, that could mean supporting a local nonprofit newsroom or an independent civic-minded daily newspaper. In others, it might mean supporting someone who might not even call themselves a journalist but regularly covers school board meetings or local immigration raids. The Media Power Collaborative is more likely, in other words, to focus on local media ownership, civic information hubs, and public schools or libraries than returning legacy newspapers to 2005 staffing levels. Free Press often hears from local journalists and organizers who’ve been asked to support a specific bill or initiative being considered in their state or city. Mike Rispoli, senior director of journalism and civic information at Free Press, said local practitioners often want to engage in policy issues, but aren’t always confident in their ability to determine if their newsroom or civic media initiative stands to benefit. Rispoli also described the Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda as an attempt at longer-term thinking. “While I think things like tax credits can be important, we also know that’s a bridge proposal at best. I think what the MPC policy agenda is [asking] is, ‘What should we be building a bridge to? What is the actual thing that we want?'” Rispoli explained. “The end goal of these policies should be more informed communities, more engaged communities, and — as a byproduct of that — supporting news and its production.” The Media Power Collaborative agenda highlights local news and information as a public good that deserves “robust public funding” whether it comes from a legacy newsroom or not. From the report: Just like safe roads and strong public-education systems, public-service journalism and civic information are public goods that benefit entire communities. Unfortunately, the market is critically underproducing these public goods: Estimates of what it would cost annually to bridge current community-information gaps range from $1 billion to $10 billion or more. Even with promising new philanthropic investments in local news and civic media, public funding is essential to addressing a deficit of this magnitude and building toward a community-centered local-news system. The agenda also reflects a widespread frustration with public policy proposals that would benefit legacy newspaper chain owners such as Alden Global Capital. This has been a consistent theme for civic information advocates though by no means limited to them. “Corporate media and hedge funds and broadcasters — these are folks who have the ears of lawmakers. They have resources to lobby. And so every starting place in the conversations about media policy is something that protects their interests,” Rispoli said. “A bit of it is saying this [civic media] part of the field deserves a seat at the table. But a bit of it is saying we should be the ones setting the table.” RELATED ARTICLEThe scale of local news destruction in Gannett’s markets is astonishingJoshua BentonMarch 9, 2023Some of these corporate owners have gutted local newsrooms, Rispoli noted, and yet they’re “the ones at the front of the line with their hand out, saying, ‘we should be getting money from the government.'” The agenda attempts to address some of the biggest questions in local news policy, including how to protect editorial independence; which local news orgs should qualify for assistance; and, given finite public funding, which communities should be prioritized. Limiting public funds to legacy news organizations does not address their history of underserving communities of color as well as rural and low-income groups. It seems more likely to reinforce existing news deserts and information gaps. Candice Fortman, a John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford and former executive director of Outlier Media, was one of the 10 members that met over the course of 2024 to craft the public policy agenda. “Many minds are working to build the agenda for the future of local news and how we will protect and fund reporting,” Fortman said. “This initiative, however, is about more than just saving local news; it’s about rebuilding it in a way that is equitable, sustainable, and deeply rooted in community needs.” The Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda calls for “a transformed media system” that is “backed by robust public funding with sturdy firewalls in place to preserve editorial independence.” Some of the specific proposals include: The full agenda is here. No one is saying any of this will be easy. Those estimates for closing the local news gap are enormous and it’s unlikely public funding alone is the answer. There are also important and fair questions about editorial independence and giving anyone — never mind the government — the power to decide which journalists and news organizations will receive taxpayer dollars. Perhaps more pressingly, though, is that although majorities of both Democrats and Republicans approve of local media, the political polarization and harsh rhetoric at the national level has trickled down to state and local policy conversations. Funding for public media — already lower in the U.S. than in many other democracies — is under threat. Even paid news subscriptions for government workers have been criticized and exploited for political purposes in recent weeks. Federal legislation seems off the table for now, and we’ll have to see how many states and cities will see proposals to support local news become law. I noted one other ominous sign. The Media Power Collaborative’s policy agenda mentions that research tells us low-income communities, communities of color, immigrant communities, and rural communities are the most underserved by our current local media system. The report includes a link to research published by the FCC. The report, which was live in late December, now shows a “page not found” error message.

Title: Early economic evaluation of chelation therapy in kidney transplant recipients with high-normal lead

Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) with high-normal lead have a higher risk of graft failure (GF). Clinically, chelation therapy using meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) removes lead. Despite the proposal that chelation therapy can prevent GF through lead removal, evidence is lacking. To guide research efforts, we conducted an early economic evaluation, aiming to explore the economic feasibility of screening for and implementing chelation therapy with oral DMSA for high-normal plasma lead concentrations in KTR (i.e., the intervention) compared to standard of care. A Markov model simulated the life course of 10,000 KTR in the Netherlands from a societal perspective. Transition probabilities were estimated using the data from TransplantLines Food and Nutrition Biobank and Cohort study. Costs and utilities were sourced from publications and public data. Model robustness was investigated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Various administration strategies were tested. Five-year costs were calculated from a healthcare payer’s perspective. Value of information was assessed. The intervention was cost-saving and improved health, leading to a dominant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The result was most sensitive to transition probabilities (led by GF, followed by death with functioning graft and after graft failure). The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 60%. Chelation strategies did not affect the result. The intervention applied to the Dutch KTR population could save €27 million in the initial five years. Further research is desirable if the cost of obtaining perfect information on GF survival is approximately below €4,000/KTR (all uncertainties under €5,000/KTR). The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is robust in KTR, except when considering the uncertainties around (graft) survival probabilities. Applying chelation therapy in the new setting we studied holds significant potential. However, trials that systematically assess the efficacy, administration strategies, and impacts on survival are crucial in updating the current evaluation and informing policies.

Lead is a toxic heavy metal predominantly found in environmental exposures, including ambient air, soil, dust, and various consumer products [1–3]. In the Netherlands, primary lead exposure originates from food and tap water supplied through ageing lead pipes [3–6], with additional contributions from legacy industrial lead and imported goods such as cosmetics [3]. Different from acute poisoning, where lead concentration surges over a dangerously high threshold, chronic exposure—from lifestyle factors, occupational settings and living conditions—poses a widespread public health concern [3,7]. Extensive evidence has indicated that even low-level chronic lead exposures can cause lead accumulation first in bones and then in kidneys [7,8], further contributing to nephrotoxicity and kidney damage [7]. As one of the risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) among obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus [7,9], lead exposure and its harms have been overlooked. A recent observational study from Sotomayor et al. (2022), in which a cohort of kidney transplant recipients (KTR) was trichotomized based on plasma lead concentrations, demonstrated that higher plasma lead concentrations at a non-toxic level (high-normal plasma concentrations, i.e., high group), are independently and consistently associated with an increased risk of long-term graft failure [10,11]. Recognizing the detrimental impact of lead on kidney function, proposals as early as the 2000s recommended screening CKD patients for acute toxic and chronic high-normal heavy metal levels, including lead [12,13]. CKD is a gradual decline in kidney function that persists for over three months. It has five stages based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) foundation guidelines, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) occurs when the kidneys can no longer effectively filter waste products from the blood for survival (i.e., eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2) [14]. Treatment for ESKD is limited to kidney replacement therapy—dialysis and/or kidney transplantation. Dialysis, a medical procedure that mimics normal kidney functions to filter waste products, can be performed either externally through machines (haemodialysis [HD]) or internally through the body (peritoneal dialysis [PD]). Modalities vary the costs of €95–€129 thousand annually per patient in the Netherlands [15]. Kidney transplantation, a surgical transfer of a healthy kidney from a donor into a patient, incurs initial costs of €56–€152 thousand; when successful, its subsequent annual upkeep expenses are substantially lowered [15]. Regardless, sustaining kidney function is essential at every stage. In addition to improving quality of life and patient experience, this is critical because kidney replacement therapy is expensive, and transplant failure would require dialysis or re-transplantation, placing further strain on resource-scarce healthcare system [16]. Acute lead poisoning is treated by chelation therapy [17], which uses chelating agents to bind metals and facilitate their removal through urine or feces. However, the efficacy of chelation therapy in reducing high-normal lead and its potential to prolong graft function through lead removal in CKD are mostly unknown. Earlier trials have shown that repeated low-dose chelation therapy with chelator calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaEDTA) effectively slows kidney function decline in CKD patients with low-level lead exposure measured by blood [18–21], which is effective over four years [22]. Despite positive results, these efforts have not been followed up or updated with technologies. For instance, compared to blood, lead measurement from plasma has a lower detection limit, higher sensitivity and better precision [23]. A newer chelator, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), is currently preferred and commonly used due to reduced disruption of essential minerals, including calcium, copper, and zinc, and fewer side effects [24–27]. Its potential efficacies and possible oral capsule administration, relative to kidney replacement therapy, could theoretically delay the progression to graft failure and thus intuitively reduce healthcare costs in CKD. This may be particularly true for KTR. As the transplanted kidneys of KTR, compared to functioning native kidneys, face a heavier functional burden and demonstrate a greater susceptibility due to ischaemia-reperfusion injury during the transplantation procedure and intrinsically nephrotoxic immunosuppressants used post-transplantation, any means of reducing additional nephrotoxicity from these vulnerable transplanted kidneys could be essential to preserve graft function. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the economic feasibility and provide considerations for using oral DMSA to prevent graft failure in KTR with high-normal plasma lead concentrations compared to the standard of care. Given the early stage of the intervention (i.e., chelation therapy using DMSA) in a new setting (i.e., KTR) and a new treatment goal (i.e., maintaining graft functioning), we conducted an early economic evaluation aligned with guidance from The Early Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report drafted by the Dutch HTA consortium [28]. Using patient-level data from the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the Netherlands, we performed analyses on cost-effectiveness, budget impact and value of information. Particularly pivotal, the report also emphasizes the exploratory nature of early HTA [28]. While our findings are likely not definitive or policy-prescriptive, they provide a solid foundation and invaluable insights to guide and inform future research. An early economic evaluation was performed, which comprised cost-effectiveness, budget impact analyses and value of information. Incremental costs () and incremental effectiveness (, i.e., quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] calculated from utilities) for the intervention compared with the standard of care were calculated. The primary outcome is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER = ). The analyses were conducted in accordance with the Dutch guideline for economic evaluation in healthcare and reported in line with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist (S1 Table). Analyses were conducted in RStudio, version 2022.12.0 + 353 [29]. We used the data on adult KTR at the UMCG who participated in the TransplantLines Food and Nutrition Biobank and Cohort study (NCT03272841) [30], which is the same cohort in which it was found that elevated plasma lead concentrations were associated with an increased risk of graft failure [11]. The participants were recruited between November 21, 2008 and May 24, 2011. All participants provided written informed consent on enrollment. The study protocol received approval from the Medical Ethical Committee (Medisch Ethische Toetsingsingscommissie [METc]) of the UMCG (METc 2008/186) and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The baseline characteristics of the hypothetical cohort and lead-concentration-based (graft) survival curves were based on an actual cohort size of 670 subjects with available plasma lead measurements. The plasma lead concentration was measured at admission for kidney transplantation and 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-months post-transplantation. Due to the lead stability that was found over this two-year follow-up period [11], the values at the admission were used, with a median of 0.31 µg/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.22–0.45 µg/L, distribution shown in S1 Fig). The trichotomized low, medium, and high groups had a mean plasma lead concentration of 0.19, 0.31, and 0.65 µg/L (S2 Table). A Markov model was developed to simulate the life course of KTR. A lifetime horizon (40 years from the first kidney transplant) and a one-year cycle length were used. The model, structured similarly to the one from Coerts et al. (2021) [31], consists of three health states which are functioning graft (FG), graft failure (GF), and death (Fig 1). A hypothetical cohort of 10,000 KRT entered the model at the FG1 stage. Since these patients still have options for re-transplantation if the transplanted kidney fails (from FG1 to GF1), a second transplantation was incorporated into the model (from GF1 to FG2). We assumed a maximum of two transplantations as a third transplantation is rare [32]. Every transplantation has a chance of primary non-function, which refers to an immediate and persistent functioning failure of a transplanted kidney (from GF1 to GF2) [33]. Each state has a chance of death, which can be categorized into death with functioning graft (DWFG) and death with graft failure (DwGF). Trapezoidal half-cycle correction was applied to account for events occurring at any point within a cycle [34]. The dashed arrow indicates primary non-function. From each state, it is possible to transition to the death state. FG1, functioning graft 1; FG2, functioning graft 2; GF1, graft failure 1; GF2, graft failure 2.

There is no screening for heavy metals. The intended intervention—chelation therapy—includes 1) initial screening of all incident KRT through an additional order of plasma lead measurement from the blood sample taken at the first post-transplantation regular checkup, 2) providing oral DMSA to the eligible KTR, and 3) among these eligible KTR, conducting follow-up screening in case of lead re-exposure every five years, using the blood sample taken via the standard of care, and administering oral DMSA if re-exposed. The administration of DMSA can be oral or intravenous. Considering the minor elevation in plasma lead concentration among KTR, oral DMSA was more suitable for our study and is more convenient to be administered at home. Oral DMSA consists of one or multiple courses of treatment, with each course comprising five days of capsule intake and a one-month waiting period for lead redistribution in the body, followed by a blood test to assess the results and determine if an additional course is needed. Blood tests were used for screening and monitoring in the process of chelation therapy; thus, their timing is important. The initial screening was conducted upon inclusion in the Markov process, and the follow-up screenings were conducted after the re-exposure period. The the lead removal effect was monitored at the beginning of the second year of chelation therapy and chelation therapy may follow depending on the results. The timeline and procedure of the intervention in the base case (BC) are visualized in Fig 2. The assumptions were as follow: a1) only the KTR in the high group were eligible for chelation therapy to achieve interventional benefits while avoiding potential side effects (i.e., intervention threshold 0.38 µg/L); a2) chelation therapy would help the eligible KTR to have a lowered lead burden from high to medium group (i.e., stopping threshold 0.38 µg/L); a3) no adverse event; a4) the eligible KTR would not require chelation therapy for at least five years after the first course of repeated chelation therapy; and afterwards, a5) in the follow-up screening every five years, 10% of the initial eligible KTR, would have a plasma lead concentration exceeding the intervention threshold, and thus, require another chelation therapy. Additionally, a6) lead stability was assumed, meaning that all KTR would remain in the same group except for the KTR eligible for chelation therapy who would transition from the high (medium) to medium (high) group due to the intervention (re-exposure). S3 Table elaborates on the rationales behind these assumptions and their potential impacts on results. Overall, the assumptions were deliberately conservative to ensure study validity and alignment with the study aims.

To estimate and extrapolate the transition probabilities for GF, DWFG and DwGF, parametric survival modeling was applied in compliance with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline [35,36]. Models were fitted using the UMCG cohort with distributions including Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, Gamma, Log-normal, Log-logistic, and Generalized Gamma. Model selection was based on visual inspection, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and expert opinions (co-author L.A.J. and S.J.L.B.) to ensure both methodological rigor and clinical applicability. Parameters from the best-fit models (i.e., GF: Log-normal, DWFG: Gamma, and DwGF: Gamma) were then used to extrapolate the survival curves to the model’s time horizon (S4 Table and S2 Fig), from which transition probabilities were subsequently calculated (, where i denotes time in years). For the GF endpoint (transitions from FG1 to GF1, and from FG2 to GF2), the parametric survival analysis was performed separately for each of the three lead groups at low, medium and high levels, adjusting for age, sex, transplant vintage, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 24-hour urinary protein excretion, to approximate the efficacy of oral DMSA in prolonging graft functioning through reduced lead. For DWFG (from FG1 and FG2 to Death) and DwGF (from GF1 and GF2 to Death) endpoints, the analyses were conducted in all KTR without lead trichotomization. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.t001 The probability of re-transplantation (from GF1 to FG2) was based on literature [37], which was assumed to linearly decline from 0.15 after age 65 and reach zero at the age in the last cycle. The probability of non-primary (from GF1 to GF2) was assumed to be 0.7%, accounting for the patients with a third or fourth kidney in the UMCG cohort. The societal perspective requires both direct medical costs and indirect costs (Table 1). All costs were adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index (CPI) from Statistics Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek [CBS]) and presented in EUR 2022 [50]. Whenever possible, cost data were obtained from the Dutch costing manual for economic evaluations in healthcare [47]. Costs associated with chelation therapy were based on published price lists from the Dutch university medical centers and expert advice (co-author D.J.T.). Blood sampling costs, not available on the UMCG website and slightly varying across centers, were averaged. Given the lack of evidence on chelation therapy in KTR with high-normal lead concentrations, a low dose of 10 mg/kg/day was assumed [51,52]. According to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu [RIVM]) in the Netherlands, DMSA is an unlicensed drug with no domestic stock or suppliers. Hence, the capsules must be imported. The purchasing price of DMSA Succicaptal® 200 mg (15 capsules) for hospital pharmacists was €400.47, excluding 6% value-added tax (VAT) [42]. Blood tests for chelation therapy can be combined with regular outpatient visits every three months, meaning no additional costs concerning travel or outpatient services. Therefore, all procedures involved in chelation therapy can be considered an add-on to the standard of care. Costs per health state reflect those directly incurred by a patient being in a health state. For example, in the graft failure state (GF1, GF2), initial graft failure and ongoing dialysis costs were included. Dialysis costs depended on the chosen modality: Conventional center HD (CHD) requires hospital visits and trained professionals, while home HD (HHD) involves patients being trained to use a portable dialysis machine at home. Automated PD (APD) allows for automatic filling and draining of dialysate, while continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) requires manual dialysate change. Costs for transplantation and post-transplantation care were applied when a patient transitioned to or remained in the functioning graft state (FG1, FG2). One-off costs for death occurred when a patient transitioned to the death state. Following the Dutch guideline for economic evaluation in healthcare, productivity losses were estimated using the friction cost method. Annual costs were summed for each Markov trace and discounted at a 4% rate. Utility values for each health state were based on European Quality of Life, Five-dimension, Three-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) values reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis (Table 1). In the graft failure states (GF1, GF2), the utility value was calculated in proportion of patients on HD (84%) and PD (16%). The utility for death was assumed to be zero. For each Markov trace, the annual QALYs were summed up and discounted at a rate of 1.5%. To assess the robustness of the model and results, univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA), multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), and scenario analyses were performed. In DSA, one parameter was varied at a time to the lowest and highest value of the 95% confidence interval (CI), with unavailable CI assumed as a standard error of 25% of the parameter’s value. Additionally, considering the high uncertainty in the price of DMSA capsules, variations of 50% reduction and 200% increase were tested. The results of the DSA analysis were plotted in a tornado diagram. In PSA, all parameters were varied simultaneously by random draws from their corresponding distributions: beta distributions for the utilities and the percentages of the working population; a gamma distribution for all the costs; and a normal distribution for the number of courses, time spent in hospital, the probabilities of re-transplantation and non-primary function. The uncertainties in the transition probabilities for GF, DWFG, and DwGF were incorporated by random draws from normal distributions defined by parameter estimates and 95% CIs of the chosen best-fit models (S4 Table and S2 Fig). Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 10,000 iterations and plotted in a cost-effectiveness plane with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €50,000/QALY, as recommended by the Dutch National Healthcare Institute considering the burden of disease (proportional shortfall: 0.63) [53,54]. To assess the probability of being cost-effective at different WTP thresholds, the simulation results were plotted in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). Scenario analyses were conducted to overcome the uncertainties surrounding chelation therapy. Key assumptions, such as transplant vintage, time horizon, discounting, and inflation rates, were examined. The exploratory nature of the study prompted scenario analyses to investigate the intervention strategies, including the number of courses, effect waning and frequency of conducting follow-up screenings, and subsequent intervention (Table 2). Adverse events, although from the previous evidence unlikely to occur [52,55], mainly include e1) impact on other metals, e2) transaminase activities, and e3) skin reactions [51]. These adverse events are either inconclusive (e1) or naturally dissolved after treatment discontinuation (e2-3), with no significant impacts on patients, especially given the low DMSA dosage in our study. However, considering the vulnerability of KTR, two safety measures, checking for iron deficiency (e1) and liver dysfunction (e2), were added to the scenarios so that any adverse effects could be detected and acted on in time, ensuring patient safety. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.t002 Budget impact analysis (BIA) assessed the short-term costs or savings of implementing chelation therapy in KTR in the Netherlands. The Dutch KTR population has a prevalence of 12,068 and an incidence of 957, according to the Dutch Renal Registry (Renine) [44]. It was assumed that all KTR would undergo a screening blood test and a third of KTR would be eligible for chelation therapy. A dynamic cohort and five-year time horizon were used with a healthcare payer’s perspective. The budget impact was calculated by the total number of patients multiplied by the discounted cost of the intervention at each cycle per patient. Value of information (VOI) evaluates whether further research to gather new data is justified by weighing the benefit of reducing uncertainties against its cost. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI), expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI), and expected value of sample information were calculated in €/KTR across WTP and visualized in plots. Screening for and implementing chelation therapy with oral DMSA in KTR with a high-normal plasma lead concentration (referred to as “the intervention” below), compared to standard of care, yields cost savings of €57.56 million and QALY gains of 351.88 per 10,000 KTR, thereby a dominant ICER (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.t003 The 15 most influential parameters are illustrated in Fig 3 (all parameters see S3 and S4 Figs). Among all, the means of logarithm (i.e., meanlog) from lognormal distribution, used to calculate the transition probabilities for GF in the medium and high groups, has the greatest impact on both and This is followed by the standard deviations (i.e., sdlog) of logarithm, similarly used for calculating the transition probabilities for GF in medium and high groups, and the rate from gamma distribution used to calculate the transition probability for DwGF.

The probability of being cost-effective is 84.27%. When applying a WTP threshold of €50,000/QALY, the CEAC shows that 59.55% of the outcomes are cost-effective. Alternatively, when all parameters vary except for the parameters used to calculate transition probabilities for GF, DWFG and DwGF, the intervention is suggested to be 100% cost-effective (Fig 4B-C, results of varying one TP parameter at a time see S5 Fig).

An increased time horizon results in higher incremental QALYs and higher savings (i.e., 10, 20 and 40 years), with an observed small gap of between 20 and 40 years, indicating that most QALY gains and savings occur in the first 20 years of the model. Overall, the strategy variations in chelation therapy did not influence the dominance. incremental effectiveness; QALY, quality adjusted life year; incremental costs; BC, base case. incremental effectiveness; QALY, quality adjusted life year; incremental costs; BC, base case. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.g005 Initial costs for the intervention amount to €3.22 million, decreasing drastically to €1.92 million in the second year and further down to about €0.10 million from the third year onward (Table 4). In the first year, the health state-related costs match the ones with the standard of care but rise more gradually in the intervention arm. Generally, the intervention can incur €2.36 million additional expenses in the first year, transitioning to cost savings and increased savings from the second year onwards. In the first five years, €27.12 million can be saved. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.t004 Under the WTP of €50,000/QALY, the expected value of obtaining perfect information is €5,081/KTR (Fig 6, EVPI). To eliminate the uncertainties around the transition probabilities for all endpoints (i.e., GF, DwGF and DWFG), €4,542/KTR are required, when €4,095/KTR and €4,069/KTR are respectively needed to reduce the uncertainties in transition probabilities for GF among all KTR and KTR in medium and high groups (Fig 6, EVPPI). Across a sample size of zero to 1,000, gathering new information on the meanlogs—the parameter used to calculate transition probabilities for GF in medium and high groups—is estimated to provide an added benefit of €2,261–€2,521/KTR and €1,745–€1,950/KTR correspondingly (S6 Fig).

Our results suggest potential cost savings and health gains from the intervention, which is estimated to save around €27.12 million in the first five years of its launch compared to standard of care. A cap of about €5,000/KTR could eliminate all uncertainties, encouraging further research on the efficacy and administration strategy of oral DMSA. In the base case, the intervention is dominant compared to the standard of care. However, the DSA reveals uncertainties around the transition probabilities, substantially influencing the cost-effectiveness results. This uncertainty could be partially attributed to the limited number of KTR observations in the parametric survival analysis for the GF endpoint resulting from trichotomization. Additionally, the use of real-world data could cause variations across all endpoints due to clinical complexities. Nevertheless, other parameters, such as costs of center haemodialysis, discounting rate of costs, and utility at the state of functioning graft, while contributing some variations, have moderate impacts on the cost-effectiveness. The extreme variations in the price of DMSA capsules (50% reduction to 200% increase) introduce minimal uncertainties. PSA indicates that approximately 60% of iteration outcomes are cost-effective. To investigate the reason for the relatively low probability, we re-ran PSA by fixing the base-case values to the transition probabilities for all endpoints. The generated results, in line with DSA, show that whilevariations in other factors, such as direct and indirect costs, systematic considerations, and utility barely influence the intervention’s dominance, variations in transition probabilities are primary contributors to high ICER uncertainty. The transition probabilities for GF in the medium group and DwGF can expand the ICER cloud from the desirable () to the undesirable quadrants (), when the transition probability for DWFG mainly affects and potentially drives the ICER cloud towards the first quadrant (), thereby affecting the probability of the intervention being cost-effective. Additionally, scenario analyses suggest that the varying strategies of chelation therapy have limited impacts on the cost-effectiveness. Although the time horizon can modify and , the intervention remains dominant possibly due to declining marginal costs and effectiveness—as follow-up time extends, ageing KTR may experience reduced utilities, which were not accounted for in the current model. Our early economic evaluation presents a plausible probability of the intervention being cost-effective. BIA suggests €27.12 million in savings in the first five years from the intervention compared to standard of care. The initial investment is estimated at around €3 million, primarily due to the first scaled screening, which is moderate compared to the health state-related costs. In the following years, the intervention costs plummet. Synthesizing all available data and our results, the extreme price of DMSA capsules, seemingly flat CEAC curve and additional PSA inspections confirm the neglectable costs surrounding the intervention, offset by the potential savings from delayed dialysis and avoided transplantation. However, uncertain survival rates for all endpoints, particularly GF, are the main concerns, as they could substantially diminish the probability of the intervention’s cost-effectiveness, which currently still hovers around 60%. The desirability of further research to eliminate the aforesaid uncertainties depends on whether study costs remain below the thresholds revealed by VOI: approximately €4,000/KTR to gain perfect information on GF survival (€6,000/KTR if only in medium and high groups, i.e., = 4,000/2 × 3), €4,500/KTR on GF, DWFG and DwGF (€6,750/KTR), and €5,000/KTR (€7,500/KTR) for all uncertainties. Besides, added benefits vary mildly with sample sizes, suggesting a trial, at a small scale, with a preferably long follow-up period, and examining survivals at all endpoints—specifically, the efficacy of oral DMSA in preserving graft function through lowered lead—could already address key uncertainties exhibited in this study and improve decision-making. Grounded in the study explorations and results, future trials might consider or test the following aspects: Given the intricacies and uncertainties of the intervention, dependent on available infrastructures and resources, future trials might benefit from additional preclinical studies. Leveraging existing cohorts and registry data across regions, supplemented by measurement of plasma lead concentration, in-depth and large-scale investigations into the lead threshold and corresponding survival rates would be possible, thus refining the range for further trial exploration. In short, gathering empirical evidence, especially through (long-term) clinical studies, is indispensable for validating the model’s hypotheses and assumptions and updating follow-up evaluations on the intervention. Only with such dedicated endeavors can the likelihood of shaping policies, updating guidelines, and realizing the intervention in clinical practices be enhanced. To our knowledge, we are the first to systematically explore the economic feasibility of screening for and implementing chelation therapy using oral DMSA in KTR with high-normal plasma lead concentrations. We utilized real-world data from a large cohort spanning 2011 to 2020 and representative of the Dutch KTR population. We applied NICE guidance to calculate and extrapolate survival probabilities in different health states [36]. We explored various scenarios to address the uncertainties surrounding the administration strategies. Our early economic evaluation, a meticulous and rigorous assessment drawing upon the existing body of evidence, highlights the potential value of integrating chelation therapy into post-kidney transplantation routines and emphasizes the need for research to substantiate the true benefits of DMSA capsules among individuals with an elevated but normal level of lead in maintaining graft function. Importantly, we outlined key considerations to guide future endeavors. Despite its strengths, the study has several limitations. Firstly, utilities calculated from EQ-5D-3L were used, deviating slightly from the Dutch guidelines, and were not age-adjusted due to insufficient evidence. Nonetheless, delaying progression to graft failure remains preferable from a patient’s perspective. Secondly, including blood tests as separate costs may overestimate expenses, as chelation therapy could coincide with routine post-transplantation check-ups [62]. This decision, however, accounts for possible variations in the time of routine checks and flexibility in each step of chelation therapy. Thirdly, Markov models cannot track individual patients, meaning that KTR in the high group who surpass the treatment threshold at certain time points are unidentifiable, and transition probabilities thus could not be adjusted. This could cause a slight overestimation of effectiveness and explain the constant incremental effectiveness in scenario analyses. Fourthly, alternative DMSA access was unexplored (i.e., pharmacies purchasing raw materials from manufacturers to compound DMSA capsules) owing to data unavailability, though our results were insensitive to DMSA prices. Furthermore, our conservative approach—targeting KTR, applying a 0.38 µg/L threshold, lowering lead from high to medium group and excluding cadmium removal—has yielded modest QALY gains (0.106 QALY gains per KTR eligible for chelation therapy, i.e., = 351.88/10,000 × 3). This approach potentially underestimates overall effectiveness but ensures the study validity and is thereby preferred given the study aims. Lastly, due to the limited research on the intended intervention in this new setting, our assumptions were informed by expert opinions, current guidelines and publications. Although the number of assumptions implies that our study is primarily rooted in theoretical exploration, our study offers a robust foundation for subsequent empirical investigations, aligned with the objectives of early HTA to guide future research and support the development of the intervention. Preserving kidney function is paramount. In this context, our early economic evaluation suggests that screening for and implementing chelation therapy with oral DMSA in KTR exhibiting high-normal plasma lead concentrations is likely cost-effective compared to the standard of care, saving costs and improving health. The cost-effectiveness is primarily driven by (graft) survival probabilities while remaining robust against other uncertainties. The proposal of applying chelation therapy to individuals with normal-high lead to prevent graft failure is at an early stage but demonstrates substantial potential. Therefore, there is an imperative need for trials that systematically evaluate the efficacy and administration protocol of chelation therapy, including the optimal treatment threshold, addressing current gaps in evidence. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s004 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s005 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s006 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s007 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s008 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s009 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s010 (DOCX) We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the participants of the TransplantLines study for generously sharing their data and dedicating their time and efforts to research purposes.

Hello there! Feeling nostalgic about those old Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo restaurants? Well, there's a new dynamic duo in the neighborhood: Applebee's and IHOP. We got to try out their first hybrid restaurant in the US, which is hoping to appeal to young diners. In today's big story, the economy is showing signs of slowing down and some are saying DOGE isn't helping things. What's on deck Markets: An inside look at what life is like at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office. Tech: Nvidia posted another big earnings beat. Business: Jeff Bezos has a new rule for The Washington Post. But first, we're taking it slow. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The economic growth spurt some were hoping for with the new administration is coming up short. President Donald Trump's second term promised tax cuts, deregulation, and an environment that would get an economy firing on all cylinders. But investors and economic experts are raising concerns about a slowdown this year. Neil Dutta, the head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, outlined how the US economy is starting to look sluggish. The market is also indicating something's amiss, as the 10-year US Treasury yield has dipped recently. That's a key benchmark of DOGE's success — lower yield means lower lending costs for consumers — but it's not dropping for the reasons DOGE wants, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. The group's cost-cutting efforts are actually further muddying the economic outlook, according to some, leading yields to drop as investors look for a safe haven. Dutta highlighted two things that have kept the economy humming — consumer and government spending — showing signs of strain. To Dutta's point, a trio of economic data released last Friday on consumer sentiment and housing indicated all was not well, which led stocks to have their worst day of the year. He's not alone in his concerns. Last week, hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen listed several factors — tariffs, less immigration, and cuts to government spending — for why he was "actually pretty negative for the first time in a while" on the economy's growth potential and where the markets are headed. The Point72 founder said he expects a "significant correction." Truist chief market strategist Keith Lerner is also treading carefully. Just six weeks after talking about a buy-the-dip opportunity, Lerner downgraded US equities for the first time in years from attractive to neutral. Predictions of an economic dropoff predated DOGE and the administration. Before the election, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the US economy's growth would ease up in 2025. And as we're less than two months into Trump's second term, a lot is subject to change. But in the short term, DOGE's intent to clean up government waste could be speeding up the economy's slowdown. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer highlighted DOGE (in addition to tariffs and immigration) as "potential growth headwinds." All this might sound counterintuitive. Wouldn't reducing the government's massive deficit be good for the economy? Billionaire Ray Dalio said rising debt could lead to a financial "heart attack" if not addressed. But Cohen said the cost cutting is like a shock to the system. ​​"When that money's been coursing through the economy over many years and now potentially it will be reduced or stopped in many ways, it has to be negative for the economy," he said. 1. Bitcoin turns bearish. The crypto token has taken a tumble — down as much as 13% from its January high — and has officially entered bear territory. Tuesday was a real drag, with bitcoin ETF investors pulling over $1.1 billion. Between policy promises falling short and last week's $1.5 billion hack of crypto-exchange Bybit, confidence in bitcoins and altcoins has faltered. The volatility takes its toll, with crypto addiction becoming a growing concern. 2. Goldman takes the Lone Star state. Southern hospitality, an open-door culture, box seats at Mavericks games — these are just some of the highlights of working at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office, according to five employees who spoke to BI. And more perks are on the horizon with Goldman planning a new Dallas campus with rooftop gardens, childcare, and more. 3. Elliott Management founder Paul Singer doesn't have fun at work. The man behind the $72 billion fund knows how to have a good time: He likes skiing, snowmobiling, and playing the keyboard. At the office, though, Singer is all work and no play, preparing for risks at every turn. In a recent interview, Singer spoke about the stresses of running a firm and his concerns about the market, but he's in it for the long haul. 1. Nvidia shrugs off DeepSeek concerns with a strong earnings beat. The chip giant reported revenue of $39.33 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates by more than $1 billion. On the earnings call, Nvidia's CFO said that demand for Blackwell chips also exceeded expectations — and the stock rose in after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang said that AI models like DeepSeek's R1 need 100 times more compute, on the call. 2. Is having Palantir on your résumé the golden ticket for tech hires? CEO Alex Karp seems to think so. BI spoke with six technical recruiting specialists to find out if this was the case. Some weren't so sure, saying the industry prefers strong results over credentials. Palantir may also still struggle with brand recognition, and its culture could be a turn-off for those hiring. 3. Amazon's AI-powered Alexa+ is finally here. After slow progress, the tech giant unveiled its long-awaited voice assistant on Wednesday. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said the upgraded Alexa can invent bedtime stories, offer recipes, and book reservations through partner companies. Here's what to expect — and how much it'll cost. 1. Model Karolina Kurkova and her husband are at war with an exclusive private island club. In a lawsuit, the model and her real-estate broker husband are alleging Fisher Island Club's board of directors threatened them and wrongfully expelled them from the club, harming their reputation and causing them millions of dollars in damages. The private island that's just south of Miami Beach is home to multiple billionaires and high-profile celebrities. The Fisher Island Club denies the lawsuit's allegations as baseless and believes the complaint "is nothing more than disgruntled former members." 2. Jeff Bezos has an opinion on the opinion page. The Washington Post owner announced sweeping changes to the paper's opinion section in a note to staff and shared on X. The paper's op-eds must support "free markets" and "personal liberties," he said. As part of the overhaul, the opinions editor, David Shipley, has stepped down. While newspaper ownership often sets the tone for op-eds, the note is Bezos' latest controversial move after over a year of internal turmoil. 3. There will be winners and losers as the new Trump administration rewrites how business is regulated. Crypto firms including Coinbase and Robinhood have already benefited. Meanwhile, some legal experts predict an uptick in traditional securities cases and a continuation of the Biden DOJ's aggressive antitrust enforcement in cases against Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Ticketmaster.

Bitcoin’s recent tumble has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to its lowest level in over two years, signaling extreme fear among investors. Macroeconomic uncertainties, fueled by threats of trade tariffs from US President Donald Trump, have only added to the unease. However, amid this bleak backdrop, a new project dubbed Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a potential alternative for crypto enthusiasts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently hit a score of 10, its lowest since June 2022. That period saw major crypto collapses like Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs, sparking widespread panic. Today, the sentiment echoes that fear, even without similar crashes. Bitcoin’s price has dropped nearly 16% in the past 30 days, hovering around $86,304. Analysts pin this on macroeconomic pressures, including Trump’s reaffirmed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with threats aimed at the European Union stoking fears of a trade war. Bitcoin investment products, particularly US spot Bitcoin ETFs, are bleeding cash. Over seven days, $3 billion flowed out, including a record $420 million single-day exit from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Funds like Ark 21Shares and Grayscale saw heavy withdrawals too. However, some analysts remain hopeful. Ben Simpson of Collective Shift says buying during extreme fear often pays off historically. But Arthur Hayes warns of a drop to $70,000. Ki Young Ju notes 30% corrections are normal in bull cycles, citing a 53% dip in 2021 that Bitcoin overcame. Amid the volatile crypto market, Bitcoin Pepe is stepping up as a fresh option in the stormy market with its ongoing presale. With the “World’s Only Bitcoin Meme ICO,” the project aims to bring Solana-like perks of speed and low fees to Bitcoin’s sturdy network. It’s a Layer-2 solution built for meme coins. The PEP-20 standard is its backbone. It lets anyone launch meme coins on Bitcoin, tapping into the blockchain’s unmatched resilience. Bitcoin’s staying power makes this a big deal. Bitcoin Pepe’s presale is rolling along in Stage 5 of 30, having raised $3,632,454 at press time, with the BPEP token priced at $0.0255 and set to rise to $0.0268 in the next stage. This tiered pricing shows a deliberate rollout plan aimed to incentivize early investors. As Bitcoin Pepe rides the meme coin wave, blending it with Bitcoin’s strength with instant transactions and tiny fees to draw users tired of Bitcoin’s usual costs, its presale offers a compelling haven for those who want to hedge against the current market turmoil. Looking ahead, the project’s roadmap hints at future growth with talk of partnerships and integrations.

Share this article BlackRock moved 5,100 Bitcoin worth approximately $441 million and 30,000 Ether valued at about $71 million to Coinbase Prime within the last hour, as tracked by Arkham Intelligence. The transfer follows BlackRock’s Tuesday movement of $160 million in Bitcoin and $44 million in Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, amid mounting pressure on BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT has experienced negative performance for three consecutive days, with approximately $741 million in net outflows so far this week, based on Farside Investors data. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day outflows of over $1 billion on Tuesday, with IBIT accounting for $164 million of the withdrawals. Given the recent Bitcoin ETF sell-off, with IBIT posting negative performance for three consecutive days, the deposit raises concerns about further liquidations. The latest transfers come as Bitcoin recovered slightly above $86,000 after dropping to $83,000 on Tuesday, its lowest level since November 2024. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes previously warned that hedge funds employing an arbitrage strategy—long IBIT and short CME futures for enhanced yield—pose a potential risk to Bitcoin’s price. He cautioned that if the basis spread narrows during a Bitcoin decline, these funds might sell IBIT and buy back futures, potentially driving the price towards $70,000.

Title: This Is the Biggest Trump-Musk Scandal That No One’s Talking About
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/192008/trump-musk-scandal-corruption-crypto
Time Published: 2025-02-27T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
In the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election, political ethics watchers, an endangered breed, worried about the increasing number of ways in which Donald Trump seemed to be for sale. “Trump keeps creating avenues for people to quietly give him money,” ran a Washington Post opinion headline, referring to the glitzy, $100,000 watches that Trump had recently presented for sale—purchasable with bitcoin. Steve Benen, an MSNBC columnist, suggested a dark scenario: “A hypothetical wealthy donor wants to give the former president a $100,000 donation—far in excess of the legal limit—so he or she buys an expensive watch. At that point, the nominee could take his cut and write a comparable check in support of his candidacy, since there is no legal limit on what candidates can spend on their own campaigns.” In the era of unlimited super PAC giving—when Elon Musk could throw hundreds of millions of dollars; the influence of X, the social media platform he owns; and his personal celebrity behind Team Trump with barely a regulatory hiccup—these concerns seemed practically quaint. Trump-themed nonfungible tokens, golden sneakers, gaudy watches, and other branded tchotchkes were small-time stuff, new incarnations of the steaks, the university, the airline, and many other failed products that Trump hawked as a private citizen. Compared to the $2 billion that his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s private equity firm received from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund—along with a nine-figure bailout from the Qatari government for his deeply indebted Manhattan office tower at 666 Fifth Avenue—it seemed that Trump had failed to fully monetize the power of his office. But Trump was already going after bigger prizes, pursuing potentially huge paydays while his donors and advisers developed plans to eliminate any legal, regulatory, and judicial obstacles still standing in the way of the ascendant American oligarchy. The new Trump administration wouldn’t just be open for business. With the aid of Musk’s DOGE wrecking ball, the administration would create the perfect environment for graft, self-dealing, and lucrative influence-peddling. And it would be legal, at least some of it. For now. One of Trump’s biggest business deals in recent history took a couple of years of waiting and some financial engineering, but it was worth it. In March 2024, after surviving a Biden administration investigation involving the Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security into the financing of its special purpose acquisition company merger, Trump Media & Technology Group, or TMTG, the parent of Truth Social, became a publicly traded company. It did so with an assist from Jeff Yass, the options king, ByteDance investor, and richest man in Pennsylvania. After helping Trump find religion on ByteDance’s mega-popular app TikTok, Yass’s firm became the largest shareholder of the holding company Trump Media was merging with, helping the venture survive a lean financial period when two Truth Social investors pleaded guilty to securities fraud as part of an insider trading investigation. Yass sold his TMTG shares soon after the company went public; Susquehanna, his investment firm, also sold its TMTG shares, but later bought back in. Trump held onto his TMTG stock, which represented more than half of all issued shares. As of mid-February, his holdings were worth more than $3 billion, making them his most valuable asset—at least on paper. If Trump were to sell any of his shares, the already volatile Trump Media stock price would likely plummet. It’s possible that, like Musk and many other billionaires, Trump uses his holdings as collateral for large loans or other deals. Like much that underwrites Trump’s empire, the value of this collateral is pretty specious, a fiction of financial engineering. In 2024, Trump Media brought in only $3.6 million in revenue—a 12 percent decline from the previous year. Overall, the company reported $400.9 million in losses. Even so, Trump Media handed its employees $107 million in stock compensation while also instituting an executive stock buyback program. TMTG’s market capitalization was a nonsensical $6.59 billion. For someone who has long been a highly leveraged pauper-billionaire, in arrears on his bills, the stock offering must have been a revelation. Without doing much at all, beyond posting on Truth Social, Trump had a multibillion-dollar asset. There was potential for so much more. In mid-October, weeks before Election Day, Trump released his first cryptocurrency token under the auspices of World Liberty Financial, or WLFI, a new venture with which Trump and his sons had partnered. (Its founders include Alex and Zach Witkoff, sons of Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.) While it got off to a slow start, WLFI eventually sold tens of millions of dollars’ worth of tokens—with $30 million worth going to Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto entrepreneur with an exceedingly checkered career history and a taste for less regulated offshore markets. Sun is currently being sued—at least for the moment—by the SEC for fraud. He has every interest in becoming a business partner with the president who will appoint the next SEC chair. “Excited to have you part of the @worldlibertyfi team and our future working together,” wrote Steve Witkoff after Sun announced his investment. By Election Day, it seemed that Trump was not just open for business but establishing new avenues of payment and possible bribery unavailable to past presidents. Gone are the days of political operatives like Robert Maheu handing over suitcases of cash to Nixon administration officials. The payoffs travel on crypto rails now, in the relative open. Or they come as hundreds of millions of dollars in super PAC donations. President Jimmy Carter putting his peanut farm in a blind trust seemed like the sort of accountability gesture that belonged to a far more naïve, less debauched era. After Trump handily won the election, the proverbial “For Sale” sign went up. Justin Sun, whose business interests include the TRON blockchain that is a favored money-laundering tool for global cybercrime, announced another $45 million purchase of WLFI tokens and began publicly advising Trump’s sons on crypto purchases. While Trump put his TMTG shares in a trust, there was little talk about his getting out of the crypto business or swearing off milking his voter base with fraudulent memecoin offerings. President Jimmy Carter putting his peanut farm in a blind trust seemed like the sort of accountability gesture that belonged to a far more naïve, less debauched era. A few days before the inauguration, Trump crossed a Rubicon of grifting that seemed absurd even for him, releasing an official “memecoin”—more accurately called a shitcoin—an essentially worthless cryptocurrency token branded with the ticker symbol $TRUMP. The token had all the hallmarks of a pump-and-dump operation—dropped without warning and hyped by Trump’s social media accounts, with about 80 percent of supply reserved for insiders who would “dump” the tokens on retail traders after they surged toward a multibillion-dollar market cap. And that’s exactly what happened, with large holders quickly selling, while one company behind the coin reaped $100 million in trading fees. Most regular folks who bought and sold $TRUMP lost money. Back in the White House, on January 29, Trump Media announced a new DeFi, or decentralized finance, venture called Truth.­Fi. The new company would put $250 million into crypto tokens while offering crypto investment products to customers. It was at least his third distinct crypto company—not counting the $MELANIA shitcoin, which Trump also promoted. As Trump throws himself into one of the world’s shadiest industries, his government is smashing the regulatory and legal apparatus that once might have kept him and his donors in check. While Musk and DOGE take aim at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—a major enemy of the crypto and banking industries—Trump is installing crypto executives, venture capitalists, and tech entrepreneurs in positions of authority across the government. A number of them come from Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm that poured billions into the crypto bubble, and whose eponymous founders emerged as major Trump backers. The SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other financial regulators will soon be heavily staffed by crypto lawyers, fintech executives, and former government employees who passed through the revolving door into the private sector and are now returning, bearing the interests of their erstwhile private-sector employers. Against this backdrop, financial crimes and political corruption seem destined to receive minimal scrutiny under the second Trump administration. His Department of Justice has already tried to scrap criminal charges in the corruption investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The decision was announced as part of a brazen quid pro quo in which Adams, his legal fate held hostage to Trump’s goodwill, promised to devote more city resources to deporting migrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi has made a point of halting anti-corruption work, while Trump signed an executive order stating that the administration would “pause” enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans bribery of foreign officials and has been a useful check on wrongdoing by both U.S. and foreign companies (that can face prosecution in the United States for bribes paid abroad). The administration said that the FCPA “actively harms American economic competitiveness,” since multinational execs couldn’t pay the bribes needed to secure deals in competitive markets. We’re witnessing a monumental and sudden transformation of U.S. legal and regulatory systems. Even white-collar defense attorneys seemed rattled, wondering if this newly permissive legal landscape will cut into their caseloads. “Abolishing globally focused investigative teams and restricting the scope of overseas bribery and foreign lobbying transparency probes will have a significant impact on what’s been a boon for the defense bar this century,” wrote Bloomberg Law. With Musk and DOGE leading the push for austerity and privatization, Trump has established a form of corporate and political governance where financial crimes are tolerated, and even legal, if they redound to his benefit or that of his allies in tech and finance. At the same time, tech companies and their CEOs have offered more direct payments, giving millions to Trump’s inauguration committee. Amazon offered Melania Trump a $40 million documentary deal, which she negotiated with Jeff Bezos over dinner at Mar-a-Lago. That deal was part of an unprecedented postelection flood of cash moving from private industry directly to the president and his family—some $80 million, according to The Wall Street Journal, “as defendants settle lawsuits the president previously filed against them and corporations enter into new business ventures.” And rather than prepare to cover Trump critically, or to fend off the lawfare and intimidation he has long employed, large media companies seem in a rush to pay him off. After the election, Disney settled a lawsuit with Trump involving ABC News for $15 million. Meta shelled out $25 million in another settlement. CBS is reportedly considering negotiating a settlement with Trump over a 60 Minutes preelection interview with Vice President Kamala Harris that Trump falsely claimed was heavily edited in her favor, but executives at CBS’s parent company worry about the legal liability that might come with such a payoff. The Trump administration is duly applying pressure: Brendan Carr, the fiercely pro-MAGA, pro-Musk Federal Communications Commission chair, has been investigating the news program. On February 12, X agreed to pay Trump $10 million to settle a Twitter-era lawsuit relating to his suspension from the platform over his role in the January 6 Capitol riot. While some of these settlement payments went to a future Trump presidential library, that $10 million allegedly went directly to Trump, who now employs Musk as an adviser and special government employee. It seemed less like a typical legal settlement than a gift. Trump is, after all, the boss, and the boss needs to be paid.

Title: CEO Alex Karp says having Palantir on your résumé is gold. We asked tech recruiters if they agreed.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp talks a big game when it comes to his employees. He's boasted on several occasions that Palantirians, as the company refers to employees, are the crème de la crème of tech workers. "If you work for Palantir, everyone knows you're good," Karp said on CNBC's Squawk Box on February 18. "No credible institution in commercial life can really be built without Palantir or an ex-Palantirian," Karp has also said. The company, which reported just under 4,000 full-time employees as of December 2024, recently hit an all-time high in its stock and brought in $2.87 billion in revenue in 2024. Following its most recent earnings report, Palantir hit a $240 billion market cap, surpassing companies like McDonald's and Disney. It hasn't only been clear skies, however, as Palantir's share price is down nearly 30% from its all-time closing high earlier this month. So do the people hiring from the tech talent pool buy Karp's glowing view of Palantirians? Business Insider spoke to half a dozen tech recruiting professionals to find out if having Palantir on your résumé is as powerful as Karp has made it sound. Deepali Vyas, a senior Partner and global head of data, AI, and FinTech at global consulting firm Korn Ferry told BI she can "absolutely say that he's right," and she considers Palantir the Goldman Sachs of the tech industry. "I've pulled people from Palantir," Vyas said. "They are a home run every single time." While she said Palantir employees tend to work long hours, the company has a "very hands-on culture" that allows even junior employees to work alongside the "brightest minds" at the company. Vyas said having that proximity helps create a certain level of training. Vyas said another factor that makes Palantir stand out is its ability to recruit people who are passionate about their work. "There's something in the sauce there," Vyas said. "They want to work on the complex problems because that's what excites them." Jason Saltzman, Director of Growth at Live Data Technologies, a company that tracks employment changes, told BI that "Palantir seems to be the stop on people's career journey that accelerates them the most." Almost a quarter of former product managers at Palantir have since become founders, he said. Ex-Palantir employees also tend to end up at a big tech company or "one of the hottest startups," Saltzman said. Google and Meta as well as Anduril and OpenAI employ many former Palantir workers, he told BI. "Not only is Palantir a rubber stamp on someone's résumé that allows them to go onto whatever they do next, but also many of them want to go solve the world's biggest problems that are shaping the future as we know it, either by joining a company or starting their own," Saltzman said. Aaron Sines, director of technical recruiting at global cloud consulting firm Edison & Black, told BI that there's some truth to Karp's statement, but overall he's seeing a "results revolution" among companies, where outcomes are placed above academic credentials and company names. "My team tells me all the time results are almost always coming over academic credentials," Sines told BI. Natan Fisher, the cofounder and co-CEO of tech and legal recruiting firm SingleSprout, similarly told BI that companies want to know how employees "operated under constraints, and whether they can drive impact in their environments." "No doubt, Palantir is a strong hiring signal, but the idea of a golden ticket in tech is outdated," Fisher said, adding that "the real hiring market doesn't reward brand names alone, it rewards execution and adaptability — who built what and scaled systems at speed." Fisher said that tech companies often seek to hire from "multiple high-caliber" talent pools such as Ramp, Stripe, Linear, and Notion, adding that they aren't clients of his. Sines said that Palantir has a reputation for seeking out top talent and having a "rigorous" and "results-oriented" hiring strategy. However, he said that while it carries a "badge of honor," for some clients, it may signal too much intensity for others. It depends on how companies perceive culture, Sines said. Farah Sharghi, a job search coach and former recruiter at tech companies including Google, Lyft, Uber, and TikTok, said that while Palantir's hiring process is "very stringent," a good employee at Palantir may not be a good employee everywhere else because "there might be some nuances to some companies versus others in terms of cultural fit." "A Palantir engineer who's used to working on some particular type of technology might not thrive in another different size company or different cultural company," Sharghi said. "So it's really subjective relative to what the company does, what their needs are, and so on." While culture may vary across tech companies, Sharghi says the guiding philosophy when it comes to hiring is largely the same across the board. "They're not looking for breadth of experience," she said. "They're looking for technical depth of experience." Alan Stein, the CEO of career-accelerating service Kadima Careers, told BI that "Palantir is a good brand name," but although it was considered, it didn't make his list of the top 100 companies that will accelerate your career. "I don't think that's as impressive as some of the other companies," he said. Stein, who has worked at several Big Tech companies, including Google and Meta, said that while Palantir candidates can definitely leverage their experience into data, engineering, or government roles, it doesn't have the same brand recognition as some other bigger companies, or Ivy League institutions like Harvard. "My hunch is more people would prefer four years of Harvard on their résumé," Stein said. Jump to

Title: Musk, DOGE, and the AI-fueled Plot to Fire Everybody

What is DOGE? Officially, it’s the “Department of Government Efficiency,” intended to find and eliminate government fraud and waste; officially, it’s also a joke, named after an old meme. DOGE doesn’t just emit mixed signals — the incoherent messaging is right there in the name. It’s part of the plan and, for supporters, part of the fun. When necessary, the government argues that what DOGE is doing is just common sense, that Elon Musk is spearheading a “comprehensive forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government,” and that the administration has a “commitment to an efficient and accountable federal workforce.” Nearly as often, though, the mask slips or gets pulled off and thrown on the ground: This isn’t true, not that we’re engaged in any meaningful sort of collective debate over facts here: According to polling, a majority of Americans think that Musk has too much power in government and share a negative view of DOGE. It’s not pure MAGA polarization, either — the public views Musk less favorably than it views President Trump. You may grant, if you insist, a genuine desire to find and eliminate inefficiencies in the federal government, but Musk and his supporters are barely trying to hide other animating impulses here. The immense contempt they have for federal workers; the immense contempt they feel for the courts or anyone else who might slow their efforts to fire said federal workers; the zealous energy they bring to cutting as many people as possible; and the willingness to make things up, or to refuse to correct falsehoods, in pursuit of a nakedly ideological project and of power more generally. Musk, who is arguably the second-most-powerful person in government, and the most successful capitalist in America, officially has “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” according to White House lawyers, but his constant (and constantly heeded) posts betray both his functional position and the minimum bound of his ambitions. Specifically, he wants to fire as many people as possible. Punishing workers is a cause and a purpose unto itself, inseparable from a grandiose conflation of personal desires and successes with the fate of humanity. It’s an ecstatic project with an accelerationist character. “I am become meme,” he declares, as his team of private-sector loyalists harasses federal employees with spiteful emails threatening to get rid of them. The message from the largest employer in the country to its disfavored employees could not be much clearer: You are waste, you are fraud. We want to make a spectacle of your misfortune. We cannot wait to fire you. DOGE is certainly helping to achieve — to quote the words of Project 2025 author and new director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought — the goal of putting federal workers “in trauma” and casting them as “the villains.” But Musk is more than a willing mercenary for someone else’s project, and his stature and influence within and outside the government imbues his slash-and-burn campaign with greater significance. Within the scope of DOGE, Musk is playing the role of government auditor and contractor, which is conflict enough. But he’s also a singular industrialist with multiple companies devoted to automation, a history of executing brutal and punitive firings, and a proudly hostile stance toward organized labor and regulation. Most relevant, however, is his longtime obsession with what he sees as the mother of all technologies. He’s an AI guy. This might explain why DOGE’s flamboyant and unprecedented performance feels both familiar and unsettling beyond the government workforce. We’re committing all of our time and resources to eliminating your job, and by the way, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. We’re chasing inconceivable power, and you might end up as collateral damage. We’re making a new world, and this is our only chance to get it right. We’re trying to fire you. This is how MAGA Republicans talk about the political moment. It’s also how America’s premier industry sounds when it’s talking about AI. Most other tech executives aren’t openly fantasizing about detaching employee “parasites” from their hosts, but some get closer than others. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg recently announced layoffs explicitly targeting “low performers,” which many at the company saw as a pointed and unnecessarily damaging way to cut costs, adding insult to injury and damaging prospects for former employees. The layoffs came in the context of a larger attempt at an ideological pivot for the company, marked by Zuckerberg’s interview with Joe Rogan (and following Musk’s mass-layoff trial run at Twitter, about which Zuckerberg, and other corporate leaders, had publicly expressed envy). They also came in the context of the company’s massive planned investment in AI, which Zuckerberg talked about on the show. “Probably, in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code,” he told Rogan. (He softened the implication by suggesting that AI would simply free people up to work on more interesting problems, but the comments reverberated, as intended, through the tech industry.) More commonly, AI executives talk about work and labor in general. In a recent blog post, OpenAI founder Sam Altman made his case for mass automation. “Imagine AI as a real-but-relatively-junior virtual co-worker. Now imagine 1,000 of them. Or 1 million of them. Now imagine such agents in every field of knowledge work,” he wrote. He suggested, with an optimistic gloss, that “huge” changes are coming: “We will find new things to do, new ways to be useful to each other, and new ways to compete, but they may not look very much like the jobs of today.” In AI, we’re getting some mixed messages too — the people working on this stuff are excited but worried. Founders and CEOs talk about glorious abundance with the public and tease concentrated returns to investors. They muse about automation and the future of work, raise alarms, fund alignment research, and talk about existential risk. Altman, for his part, has commissioned research into the plausibility and effects of UBI for a post-AI world. A bit like DOGE, however, OpenAI’s conflicted identity is embodied in its name and concept. The company was a nonprofit with the mission to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” By 2019, it was teaming up with Microsoft to raise tens of billions of dollars. Now, it’s in the process of converting into a for-profit company. Just as DOGE is pursuing something more than simple increases in efficiency, AI firms are pitching something more than simple increases in productivity. The gap between the industry’s coy, delicate rhetoric around automation in some contexts — oh, maybe we’ll need UBI, ha-ha, er, well, it’ll be a lot of change very fast, but it’ll work out maybe, eh, maybe regulate us? — and its far less conflicted pitch to investors is not lost on people whose jobs might be defined as “knowledge work,” nor is its fervor as expressed in sheer dollar amounts. “Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft intend to spend as much as $320 billion combined on AI technologies and data-center build-outs in 2025,” reports CNBC, a level of investment for which observers have struggled to find comparison (although here’s one from The Information: “Big Tech’s Capex Gusher Tops Last Oil Spree,” a.k.a. the shale boom). Many of the largest and most visible companies in the economy, in other words, are working toward the same goal, collectively marshaling a level of resources otherwise associated with national infrastructure projects or wars. You can characterize their goals and corresponding long-term outcomes in a wide range of ways, but if you live anywhere downstream from their project, the message, again, is pretty clear, albeit with a few more apologies and caveats appended as necessary, delivered with polite contrition rather than foaming zeal: We’re sorry, but we have no choice but to do everything in our power to replace you with machines. New polling from Pew suggests that this message is being heard, and the Zuckerbergian appeals to the history of automation — that maybe it will create more, better jobs in the long term, after periods of transitional pain — aren’t resonating. According to a Pew survey of American workers, 52 percent are “worried about the future impact of AI use in the workplace,” while 32 percent “think it will lead to fewer job opportunities for them in the long run.” Though 36 percent “feel hopeful” about how AI might be used at work, 33 percent are “overwhelmed,” while just 6 percent believe it will lead to more job opportunities in the long run. The parallels between DOGE’s all-or-nothing bet that it can purge the federal government and the AI industry’s promise to purge humans from wide swaths of the existing private workforce are united in the figure of Musk, a former partner in OpenAI who now runs his own AI firms; to him, the projects are clearly connected, synergistic, and mutually necessary. He’s making this fairly explicit! DOGE is claiming, with few details, to use AI to further its missions, however you might interpret them: AI to replace government work; AI to arbitrarily fire people with a sheen of analysis; “AI” wielded as a broader demoralizing force or conveniently summoned threat to workers. There are intentional and unintentional aspects of his leadership at DOGE that, if nothing else, clarify the beliefs he’s enacting and seem to hold. Perhaps most of the government shouldn’t exist, and someone like Musk should run what’s left of it. Perhaps most jobs shouldn’t exist, or at least inevitably won’t, so why wait around? Perhaps employees who wish to have jobs should be reminded to do as they’re told. It can be hard to call a moment or define an era without the benefit of hindsight, and tipping points tend to reveal themselves in retrospect. As top-down attempts to impose and manifest a different world go, though, this is almost parodically blunt stuff. The president is a guy who rose to national fame firing people from fake jobs on a TV show. His publicly unhinged billionaire quasi-co-president is a man who appears to believe that most government jobs are fake, and who has been deputized to eliminate as many of them as possible. Like many of his peers in private industry, this same guy talks in urgent and increasingly dire terms about winning the race to build human-level and maybe superhuman AI, a project into which the tech giants are sinking the hundreds of billions of dollars in cash they’ve harvested from their users over the last decade. Whatever you think of its chances of succeeding, and whatever you think would come out of the other side in the long term, their fundraising resembles a bet on, at minimum, short-to-medium-term mass displacement in segments of the economy that were until recently understood as relatively safe. In fuller expression, it’s not just a post-worker vision, it verges on post-human. To anyone who isn’t invested in these outcomes, either literally or ideologically, it’s an unsettling wager. In Trump, Musk, and Silicon Valley’s speculative CEOs — whose musings and strategies are certainly being heard and nervously interpreted by leaders across various potentially disruptable industries — America is living under a nightmare boss trifecta, each potentially familiar to different workers in their own way. There’s the one who wants to fire you for disloyalty, the one who wants to fire you because he thinks you’re undeserving and less than, and the one who grimaces through the PIPs and the RIFs but lights up during the earnings calls. The news can, at times, resemble a Zoom call from hell, with Americans on mute as management talks through plans for getting rid of them. It’s layoff morning in America. These parallels also extend into an unknown future. It’s increasingly clear that Musk and Trump have ambitions for DOGE that extend beyond cuts and into meta-governmental control. It represents, in other words, an all-or-nothing bet on remaking, destroying, or perhaps controlling the government, with a massive potential upside for those involved and correspondingly large risk if they fail. Big tech’s push into AI is similarly high stakes, with firms both excited about possible returns but also fearful of getting stuck on the wrong side of a massive reallocation of power. A superpower freed of its opposition and a superintelligence freed of its labor force are versions of the same fantasy in which absolute power is seized, or obtained, through different means. These expressions of absolute self-belief shouldn’t be confused with inevitability, of course, nor, should they come up short of counterrevolution and post-human superintelligence, respectively, will their almost unbelievable nakedness be forgotten. (A pressing question about both is whether they’re accelerating toward a lasting new status quo, ramping like a manic episode, or a little bit of each. Either way, they have the potential to be widely galvanizing.) Given overlapping once-in-a-generation opportunities, America’s most empowered and resentful bosses have converged on the same simple plan: laying everyone off.

Title: Fidelity Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios (Meant for Advisors)

Time Published: 2025-02-27T08:12:21Z

My Money Blog One of my older relatives used Fidelity to manage their investments, and it was a hodgepodge of over 10 different mutual funds with a total expense ratio nearing 1%. The last time I measured its long-term performance, it lagged the benchmark indexes by… roughly 1%. Since then, I’ve always viewed that as a big part of Fidelity’s business model. They will sell you a portfolio that looks complex and smart, with fancy-sounding names and lots of moving parts. In the end, your performance will be okay because it will capture most of the stock market return, and most folks won’t even notice the chunk that was missing from fees. From a certain perspective, you paid a fee and got what you wanted: a stamp of approval from a respectable name. If you’re wondering how Fidelity can offer their excellent customer service and products at such a competitive prices, this is why. There are many people paying additional fees for their various advisory services. I’m okay with that – as a DIY investor I am comfortable turning down their upsell pitches for additional assistance. So when I saw the ETF.com article Fidelity Debuts All-ETF Model Portfolios for Advisors, I admit that I had my preconceived notions. Would they surprise me? You can view all of model portfolios here. Here is a screenshot with just their moderate risk 60% stock/40% bond portfolio. The hodgepodge of fancy names is still going strong. It’s like a checklist of industry buzz words: Dynamic Growth, Enhanced, High Dividend, Momentum, Inflation, Multifactor. I find it amusing that Dividend tends to equate to “Value”, which is the opposite of “Growth”. If you own this many different things, how different is it really from just owning the entire stock market? There still appears to be added complexity just for the sake of looking complex. Is it really helpful to have 2% in the iShares Core Dividend ETF? Or 2% in Cash Sweep? SIX to EIGHT different US bond ETFs??? With a weighted expense ratio of 0.25%, the overall cost is much lower than their active mutual fund portfolios from 10+ years ago. Competition from Vanguard and Blackrock have forced the expense ratios lower across the industry. So while the Fidelity model seems to pretty much the same, it does now come potentially at a lower price. So that’s a good thing. Some of these Fidelity ETFs are barely a year old, so we can’t do a backtest. I will have to remember to run another comparison 10 years from now between this 60/40 Fidelity ETF portfolio and a simple 3-ETF low-cost index portfolio from Vanguard (42% VTI/18% VXUS/40% BND) or iShares (42% ITOT/18% IXUS/40% IUSB). The low-cost index portfolio have a weighted expense ratio of about 0.04%. Can the Fidelity outperform and justify their higher fees? Complexity breeds dependency. If the advisor placed the funds in 3 or 4 ETFs, or a single Target Retirement Fund, the customer would soon question why they are paying for advisory services. We can’t have that! 🎯 😁 I imagine there’s also at least some overlap between some of these ETFs. Is there a tool that can take a number of ETFs/mutual funds and go through their holdings to determine how much you’re holding of each company? That could also be used to immediately determine how this fares against the Vanguard and iShares since the underlying holdings have been around for long enough.

Title: Bitcoin Post-Election Rally Crushed: Prices Dip Below $84,000 As Tariff Tensions Rise

On Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) prices plummeted to a four-month low, reaching as low as $81,000, as the anticipated “Trump bump” in the markets faded. This has prompted investors and traders to hedge against further decreases, with Bitcoin options indicating a notable interest in put options with a strike price of $70,000. According to data from Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, this strike price represents the second-highest open interest among all contracts set to expire on February 28, with a total of $4.9 billion in open interest poised to expire by Friday. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, Bitcoin has experienced a substantial decline of roughly 20% from its record highs. Market analysts attribute this downturn to a combination of factors, including Trump’s “aggressive geopolitical” stance and ongoing concerns about elevated inflation. Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, noted, “Tariff policies are further dampening the outlook, and stubbornly high short-term inflation expectations add to the overall caution.” Newhouse also highlighted that the Bybit Ethereum (ETH) hack has not only exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price but has also negatively impacted overall market sentiment. The market has also witnessed a significant liquidation of bullish bets, with around $2 billion wiped out over the past three days, according to data from Coinglass. Bitcoin perpetual futures—a popular method for offshore investors to leverage their positions—saw a sharp decline in long positions during this timeframe. Adding to the bearish sentiment, demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has waned, with the group experiencing approximately $2.1 billion in outflows over the past six days. This reflects a broader trend of investors pulling back, with more than $1 billion withdrawn from spot Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday alone, marking the largest outflow since these funds debuted in January of the previous year. The Fidelity Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) were among the hardest hit. Bohan Jiang, head of over-the-counter options trading at Abra, commented, “This is a mix of spot selling and basis unwind. In my view, nearly all of this is from ETF spot outflows from directional traders.” Ethereum has also felt the impact of the Bybit incident, amplifying its volatility, while Solana (SOL) has surrendered gains achieved in recent months amid declining interest in memecoins. The market’s search for a new catalyst to reverse its bearish sentiment has led many investors to remain on the sidelines, rotating out of cryptocurrencies in a risk-off environment. Ravi Doshi, co-head of markets at crypto prime broker FalconX, stated, “The crypto market is still in search of a new catalyst to reverse bearish sentiment.” Currently, BTC is attempting to find support at $84,578, but has fallen another 4.5% in the 24-hour time frame.

Title: Irelandâs electricity crisis: AI data centers to consume one third of national grid by 2026
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-02-27-irelands-electricity-crisis-ai-data-centers-one-third-national-grid-by-2026.html
Time Published: 2025-02-27T06:00:00Z

While the Irish government, through the Irish Development Authority (IDA), champions these developments as critical to the nationâs digital economy, critics argue that the benefits disproportionately serve transnational corporations rather than Irish citizens. This raises urgent questions about energy equity, national infrastructure, and the long-term sustainability of Irelandâs energy policies. The rise of data centers and the AI boom The rapid expansion of data centers in Ireland is inextricably linked to the global rise of AI technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Irish data centers will consume a staggering 33% of the countryâs electricity grid by 2026. Currently, Ireland hosts between 82 and 95 data centers, with dozens more under construction or in the planning stages. By 2026, this number is expected to reach 130, cementing Irelandâs status as a European hub for data storage and processing. While the Irish government and the IDA frame this growth as essential for economic development, the reality is more complex. A report by international law firm Mason, Hayes & Curran highlights that âAI has significantly driven the demand for data center capacity,â noting that the scale and power requirements of these facilities have grown exponentially as AI technologies expand globally. Yet, public discourse often glosses over the role of AI, instead emphasizing the role of data centers in supporting everyday digital activities like streaming or online shopping. âWhether you realize it or not, every streaming show you watch, every match you make on Tinder, and every flight you book is facilitated by a data center,â wrote RTE Brainstorm in April 2024. While technically accurate, this framing obscures the larger truth: Irelandâs data centers primarily serve the profit-driven needs of transnational corporations, not the Irish public. Who owns Irelandâs data centers? The ownership of Irelandâs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two. These companies have sought to offset their energy consumption by investing in Irish wind farms, entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy without directly owning the infrastructure. For example, Amazon has invested in wind farms in County Cork (23 MW), County Galway (115 MW), and County Donegal (pending review). However, critics argue that this creates a circular problem: transnational corporations drive the need for more electricity, then invest in renewable energy projects to meet that demand, effectively privatizing Irelandâs energy resources. Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role. Equinix, which operates six data centers in Ireland and plans to build a seventh, is largely owned by institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These facilities host a wide range of clients, from software giants like Adobe and Microsoft to telecom providers like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom. The construction boom and its beneficiaries The construction of data centers has become a lucrative sector in Ireland, with companies like Winthrop Technologies leading the charge. Founded in 1995, Winthrop has grown into one of Europeâs largest data center construction firms, with projected 2024 revenues of â¬2 billion. In April 2024, private equity firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in the company for over â¬800 million, signaling the growing value of data center infrastructure. Winthropâs projects include a 96 MW data center in Dublin and multiple other facilities across the capital. While the construction sector benefits from this boom, the long-term economic value of data centers to Ireland remains questionable. As the IDA itself acknowledges, data centers should be assessed âin the context of the total economic value they bring,â including their role in supporting the broader data economy. However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Irelandâs data center boom raises profound questions about the nationâs energy future. As electricity prices rise and the grid struggles to meet demand, ordinary households face increasing strain. Recent storms, such as Storm Ãowyn, exposed the fragility of Irelandâs infrastructure, leaving many without power for weeks. Yet, data centersâmassive consumers of electricityâremained largely unaffected, highlighting a stark disparity in energy access. The Irish governmentâs support for data centers reflects a broader trend of prioritizing corporate interests over public needs. By 2026, the nationâs electricity grid will be stretched to its limits, with one-third of its capacity dedicated to powering data centers owned by international tech giants. This raises the specter of a tech-induced electricity famine, where Irish households and businesses bear the brunt of an overburdened grid while transnational corporations enjoy guaranteed supply. In the end, Irelandâs data center policies may represent a Faustian bargain: trading land, energy, and infrastructure for the promise of economic growth, only to see the benefits flow overwhelmingly to absentee corporate landlords. As the nation grapples with this imbalance, the question remains: who will power Irelandâs futureâits people or its data centers? Sources include: Expose-News.com DataCenterMap.com Enoch, Brighteon.ai While the Irish government, through the Irish Development Authority (IDA), champions these developments as critical to the nationâs digital economy, critics argue that the benefits disproportionately serve transnational corporations rather than Irish citizens. This raises urgent questions about energy equity, national infrastructure, and the long-term sustainability of Irelandâs energy policies. The rise of data centers and the AI boom The rapid expansion of data centers in Ireland is inextricably linked to the global rise of AI technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Irish data centers will consume a staggering 33% of the countryâs electricity grid by 2026. Currently, Ireland hosts between 82 and 95 data centers, with dozens more under construction or in the planning stages. By 2026, this number is expected to reach 130, cementing Irelandâs status as a European hub for data storage and processing. While the Irish government and the IDA frame this growth as essential for economic development, the reality is more complex. A report by international law firm Mason, Hayes & Curran highlights that âAI has significantly driven the demand for data center capacity,â noting that the scale and power requirements of these facilities have grown exponentially as AI technologies expand globally. Yet, public discourse often glosses over the role of AI, instead emphasizing the role of data centers in supporting everyday digital activities like streaming or online shopping. âWhether you realize it or not, every streaming show you watch, every match you make on Tinder, and every flight you book is facilitated by a data center,â wrote RTE Brainstorm in April 2024. While technically accurate, this framing obscures the larger truth: Irelandâs data centers primarily serve the profit-driven needs of transnational corporations, not the Irish public. Who owns Irelandâs data centers? The ownership of Irelandâs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two.

This raises the specter of a tech-induced electricity famine, where Irish households and businesses bear the brunt of an overburdened grid while transnational corporations enjoy guaranteed supply. In the end, Irelandâs data center policies may represent a Faustian bargain: trading land, energy, and infrastructure for the promise of economic growth, only to see the benefits flow overwhelmingly to absentee corporate landlords. As the nation grapples with this imbalance, the question remains: who will power Irelandâs futureâits people or its data centers? Sources include: Expose-News.com DataCenterMap.com Enoch, Brighteon.ai Who owns Irelandâs data centers? The ownership of Irelandâs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two. These companies have sought to offset their energy consumption by investing in Irish wind farms, entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy without directly owning the infrastructure. For example, Amazon has invested in wind farms in County Cork (23 MW), County Galway (115 MW), and County Donegal (pending review). However, critics argue that this creates a circular problem: transnational corporations drive the need for more electricity, then invest in renewable energy projects to meet that demand, effectively privatizing Irelandâs energy resources. Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role. Equinix, which operates six data centers in Ireland and plans to build a seventh, is largely owned by institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These facilities host a wide range of clients, from software giants like Adobe and Microsoft to telecom providers like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom. The construction boom and its beneficiaries The construction of data centers has become a lucrative sector in Ireland, with companies like Winthrop Technologies leading the charge. Founded in 1995, Winthrop has grown into one of Europeâs largest data center construction firms, with projected 2024 revenues of â¬2 billion. In April 2024, private equity firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in the company for over â¬800 million, signaling the growing value of data center infrastructure. Winthropâs projects include a 96 MW data center in Dublin and multiple other facilities across the capital. While the construction sector benefits from this boom, the long-term economic value of data centers to Ireland remains questionable. As the IDA itself acknowledges, data centers should be assessed âin the context of the total economic value they bring,â including their role in supporting the broader data economy. However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Irelandâs data center boom raises profound questions about the nationâs energy future. As electricity prices rise and the grid struggles to meet demand, ordinary households face increasing strain. Recent storms, such as Storm Ãowyn, exposed the fragility of Irelandâs infrastructure, leaving many without power for weeks. Yet, data centersâmassive consumers of electricityâremained largely unaffected, highlighting a stark disparity in energy access.

Forex traders react to US tariff news, boosting dollar; rupee closes at 87.21 against USD amid market volatility. TVS Motor Company has partnered with the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), AMU Leasing, and Natural Resources Défense Council (NRDC) to launch the ‘Wheels of Empowerment’ initiative. Nvidia has once again delivered a stellar Q4 earnings update, posting $39.3 billion in revenue, which represents a 78% YoY increase from $22.1 billion in the same quarter last year, comfortably beating the market estimate of $38.1 billion. The real star of the quarter? Blackwell AI chips, which recorded a staggering $11 billion in first-quarter sales alone—the fastest in the company’s history. Net income also reached $22.1 billion (80% YoY growth), surpassing analysts’ expectations of $19.8 billion, suggesting investors might rethink their current strategy of investing in China and coming back to the US. Despite these impressive numbers, the market reaction has been rangebound due to the following reasons: A slight dip in gross profit margins (QoQ) Heightened competition Persisting customer concentration Stratospheric expectations Gross margins fell to 71%, barely meeting estimates but down from 73.5% last quarter, as the California-based company ramps up production of its cutting-edge Blackwell chips. The adjusted gross margins aren’t going to improve soon, with the management expecting it to remain in the low 70s due to “a significant ramp of Blackwell production”. The new-gen chips will have added complexities and involve higher costs as its CEO Jensen Huang admitted that the AI market is transitioning from generative AI to reasoning. Winner’s curse While a slight dip in margins is expected at this scale, Nvidia’s near-flawless track record has set exceptionally high investor expectations where even minor setbacks get magnified. Adding to the challenge is The potential upending of the chip market, as more players seek to replicate China’s DeepSeek, which has pulled the run from underneath the feel of US AI exceptionalism and created doubts about future AI linked chips volume and value growth. However, this time, the Nvidia brass was keen on stamping its products’ superiority, saying their chips are more advanced and have better use cases in the AI ecosystem. 57 of 63 of Wall Street analysts indicated a Buy rating for Nvidia since the earnings call, suggesting an emerging bullish sentiment despite the recent weakness of US tech stocks. Meanwhile, customer concentration risk remains, with major clients like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet (Google)’s current AI war continuing to dominate Nvidia’s revenue stream. In all, the world’s leading chipmaker, based in Santa Clara, California, has once again delivered strong results, but with the AI sector evolving rapidly and macroeconomic uncertainties looming, the margin for error is razor-thin. Investor sentiment remains cautious, as any perceived weakness—be it in financials, competition, or macro conditions—could weigh on the stock. In conclusion Nvidia’s numbers remain robust, shrinking gross margins notwithstanding. From an investment perspective, it remains a buy on dip, particularly with its next-gen Blackwell chips posting amazing numbers and protect Nvidia’s medium-term runway. In the short term, the upcoming Nvidia GTC conference, billed as the AI Woodstock, penned in for March 12 to 17 next month, will likely be another propeller.

Similarly, clarity on risk weights for MFI exposure for banks releases capital for growth. We refrain from concluding that the RBI is now satisfied with credit discipline in these segments. However, this would be sentimentally positive for the MFI segment. Basis the impact of these regulations, Bandhan Bank and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank would be most benefited. Amongst NBFCs, positive impact on cost of borrowings is expected to be under 0.1%, with Five-Star Business Finance and L&T Finance expected to see highest improvement. Welspun Investments and Commercials Ltd (constituent of Welspun Promoter Group and person acting in concert with them) has acquired 40,000 (0.03%), equity shares of Welspun Enterprises Ltd from the open market. Welspun Investments stock traded at ₹662.50 on the NSE, gaining 3.30%. Benchmark indices opened flat on Thursday morning as traders remained cautious ahead of the monthly futures and options (F&O) expiry, with ongoing concerns about potential US tariffs and continued foreign institutional investor (FII) selling weighing on market sentiment. Benchmark indices open flat ahead of F&O expiry, with concerns over US tariffs and FII selling impacting market sentiment. Crude oil futures traded higher on Thursday morning following the US decision to revoke Chevron Corporation’s licence to operate in Venezuela. Crude oil futures rise after US revokes Chevron's Venezuela licence, impacting Brent, WTI, and MCX prices. RBI’s recent move to restore the Risk Weights on bank loans to NBFCs to its 2023 levels will enhance liquidity for the NBFC sector.

Moody’s Ratings said India has a lower overall exposure to the US relative to others in the APAC region, although certain sectors such as food, textiles and pharmaceutical products face risks. Moody’s said most companies in its rated portfolio are domestic-focused with limited exposure to the US market. To mitigate pressure from reciprocal tariffs, the US and India are reportedly engaged in talks to lower import tariffs on select US products, increase market access for US farm products and increase US energy purchases, while seeking to initiate a trade deal by the fall of 2025. Across APAC, developing countries like India, Vietnam and Thailand have among the widest rate differentials relative to the US, Moody’s said. It said electronics, motor vehicles, food and textiles are the most exposed sectors. In addition to the hit from lower export demand, a key risk facing emerging economies in the region is that those aiming to nurture an export-led growth model similar to China and other advanced APAC economies will find it difficult to compete in an increasingly interventionist trade environment. US President Donald Trump has announced he will impose reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners, including India. The new US administration has already enacted additional 10 per cent tariffs on imports from China and 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium. Moody’s said while the US is an overall net exporter of food, feeds and industrial supplies to APAC, it is a net importer of capital goods, automotive vehicles and parts and consumer goods. Reciprocal tariffs will have an impact on a number of key sectors in APAC with exposure to US final demand, such as computer and electronic products, chemicals, motor vehicles, as well as food, textiles and wood products. “India has a lower overall exposure relative to most others in the region, although certain sectors such as food and textiles as well as pharmaceutical products face risks,” Moody’s Ratings said. The rating agency said APAC’s overall policy response will be crucial in determining the full impact on credit strength. “We expect governments will likely act pragmatically, aiming to avoid escalation with the US, preferring to negotiate on a bilateral basis, as shown by recent developments,” Moody’s said. Given a more restrictive trading environment, currencies of targeted APAC economies could face continued downward pressure given potentially higher capital outflows and a likely stronger US dollar, with regional central banks having a much narrower window for easing domestic monetary policies to support economic growth. Most of these economies have adequate macroprudential buffers and sound monetary policy frameworks in place that will mitigate the impact of external shocks. Moreover, domestic demand in most parts of the region remains strong, bolstered by a modest easing of global and regional financial conditions, Moody’s said. Given the disruptions that lie ahead for the world trading system as result of US trade policies, governments in the region may also be further incentivized to achieve an enhanced degree of cooperation with one another, Moody’s said. ● Round also saw participation from Dewang Neralla’s family office and Jupiter Metaverse LLP along with other well known angels Dr. Ritesh Malik, Mr. Mitesh Shah, and Mr. Nilesh Doshi ● HiWiPay is a cross border payment platform revolutionizing international remittances for students, parents, and businesses ● Over the past 12 months, the company has partnered with over 500 consultants and expanded its operations across multiple cities in India, strengthening workforce in these regions to drive sales growth ● The Company plans to touch $100 million in transaction volume over the next 12 – 18 months ● Funds raised to be used to expand and enhance the trade remittance business, as well as to scale up operations in the education remittances sector ● The Company has built a portal that enables exporters to seamlessly collect payments with all necessary documentation in place Key highlights by DMI Finance Private Limited The global economy could undergo significant changes as the U.S., under President Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” framework, seeks to renegotiate trade deals with major economies. This framework could potentially raise U.S. import tariffs significantly by factoring in tariffs, VAT, and non-tariff policies, and could disrupt decades of trade policy and challenge the post-WWII global order that has favoured free trade. India, with a high tariff differential with the U.S., may face headwinds from potential U.S. tariffs, but its relatively lower export dependence limits the economic impact. Further, India and the U.S. are actively negotiating a bilateral trade agreement, expected to be finalized by Sep - Dec ’25. This could potentially shorten the duration of any reciprocal tariffs, should they be implemented. With trade policy uncertainty, India is focusing on boosting domestic demand through fiscal and monetary policy measures to support growth. The FY26 Union Budget shifts focus from government CAPEX to boosting private consumption while maintaining fiscal consolidation. Aligning with fiscal efforts to boost demand, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the policy rate by 25-bps in February to 6.25%—its first cut in nearly five years. India’s economic growth showed signs of moderate recovery in Q3, driven by continued robust agricultural growth, improved industrial activity, and resilient services. Recognising the moderate recovery and lower-than-expected GDP print in Q2, we revise our real GDP growth forecast for FY25 from 6.7% to 6.1%. For FY26, we project economic growth to show a moderate pick to 6.4%, factoring in policy support. Headline CPI inflation dropped to 4.3% in January, driven by a sharp decline in food inflation. It is expected to stay around 4% in February and March. This sets the stage for a potential 25-bps policy rate cut in April, though uncertainties from U.S. trade and tariffs persist. Economic Research Team The RBI’s measures to ease cost of and access to funding for borrowers and intermediaries (NBFCs) continue. This should further boost investor sentiment and help most NBFCs’ earnings over time. Among the biggest beneficiaries, we rate ABCL OW. PNBHF, SHFL, and BAF (all OW) are most preferred. Preferred stocks in view of this positive development: ABCL (OW) screens well on benefit to earnings, cheap valuation, and YTD underperformance; it is also a play on improving unsecured credit. Given the positive impact on overall group sentiment, we reiterate plays with stronger risk-reward: i.e., PNBHF (OW), Shriram Finance (OW) and Bajaj Finance (OW) – our preferred NBFC picks. The RBI notification on reversed the 16-Nov-23 notification of the additional 25% Risk Weight applied on the earlier rating wise risk-weight on a bank loan. However, the risk-weight increase to 125% from 100% on personal loans and credit card outstandings by NBFCs has been kept unchanged. Overall, we see this move (in addition to the 25bps repo rate cut earlier) as an important signaling from the RBI that it is getting comfortable with growth in the NBFC sector after the moderation achieved as a result of its Nov-23 actions. In terms of tangible impact, flow of funds to NBFCs from banks should improve hereon; notably, the fund-flow saw a considerable decline from Dec-23 to Dec-24. But the cost of funds (CoFs) for NBFCs will not see material improvement from this move, as CoFs had not risen too meaningfully following the RBI’s Nov-23 actions. Overall, outlook for the NBFC sector will continue to be driven by stable-to-slightly moderating AUM growth and stable NIMs, with sticky operating expenses and credit costs leading to slight moderation in RoAs in FY25 and H1FY26 vs FY24. Based on the risk-reward proposition, we prefer SHFL and MMFS. “India’s GDP growth in Q3FY2025 is expected to show an upward bias and is expected to be in the range of about 6.3-6.4%, primarily driven by increased government spending and improved household consumption during the festive season. Government capital expenditure surged to ₹2.7 trillion, marking about a 30% increase compared to the average of the first two quarters which was a bit muted due to general elections. This boost was aimed at stimulating economic growth amid uneven household consumption trends. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), which constitutes ~58% of GDP, is expected to rise to 6.4% in Q3, following moderation in Q2 (5.4%), benefiting from festive season demand. Agricultural output remained strong, supported by favorable monsoons and higher Kharif crop yields, positively impacting rural consumption. The higher consumption (due to the festive season), higher government capital expenditure, and better agri-produce also helped the services sector in Q3FY2025. Besides, services exports have also shown upward trend in Q3FY2025 While long-term GDP sustainability depends on income growth, job creation, and private sector investment, the Q3FY2025 growth outlook remains positive, largely supported by public expenditure, conducive monsoon conditions leading to higher output in major Kharif crops, strong performance of the services sector, and services export.” “The restoration of risk weights to once again being based on external rating, for Bank lending to NBFCs, is a welcome move benefiting both banks and NBFCs. Lending to NBFCs constitutes ~9% of overall banking system credit. Revision in risk weights to the pre-Nov’23 levels will free-up capital for banks and provide additional headroom for credit growth to them. On the other hand, for NBFCs, banks have been a significant source of funding which was seeing a secular uptrend till the Nov’23 circular, which had increased risk weights on bank lending to higher rated NBFCs. Post implementation of the circular, bank lending to NBFCs stood almost flat at ~Rs.13 lakh crore for three quarters till Sep’24 seeing some revival only in the recent Dec’24 quarter. Restoring risk weights to the pre-Nov’23 levels could lead to additional credit flow from banks to NBFCs and thus increase funding availability for the NBFC sector”.

Title: Goldman Sachs poised to roll back DEI practices in annual report: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/business/goldman-sachs-poised-to-roll-back-dei-practices-sources/

Goldman Sachs is set to scale back some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies amid a White House-backed crackdown on so-called “woke” capitalism, The Post has learned. CEO David Solomon will change course under the threat of possible lawsuits after President Donald Trump ordered US Attorney General Pam Bondi to stamp out so-called DEI practices in the private sector, sources familiar with the matter said. The Wall Street giant’s move, slated to be formally confirmed this week, comes as a string of its Wall Street rivals scrubbed DEI language from their annual reports to shareholders, known as 10-Ks. Those include BlackRock and Bank of America, according to 10-Ks filed Tuesday night by both companies reviewed by The Post Larry Fink’s BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.4 trillion under management, and the Brian Moynihan-led lender axed language that promoted the representation and participation of different minority groups. The finer details of Goldman’s reversal are still being thrashed out by the bank’s top brass, the sources said, but it is expected the firm will dramatically soften any DEI terms that featured in last year’s report. The issue was discussed by Solomon and the bank’s partners at their annual meeting in Miami earlier this month, multiple sources told The Post. It follows the bank’s decision to scrap a policy that banned doing IPOs for companies with all-white, all-male boards. “Our focus has been and will continue to be on attracting the best talent, which has long been the basis for our commercial success,” a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to comment on any upcoming securities filings. Solomon, who raked in $39 million last year, was one of the banking industry’s most vocal champions of the policies aimed at encouraging more representation from minority groups. The 63-year-old wrote to Goldmanites on the topic in March 2019, one year before the worldwide Black Lives Matter movement forced the issue to the top of the agenda of boardrooms across corporate America. “Diversity and inclusion is a top priority at Goldman Sachs. We know that the strength of our culture, the execution of our strategy, and our relevance to our clients depend on a truly diverse workforce and inclusive work environment,” Solomon wrote in the memo six years ago. The company’s website currently pledges that Goldman is “committed to making progress toward racial equity, advancing gender equality, and increasing representation at every level of our firm.” The bank’s 2023 annual report, posted in February of last year, added: “We believe that diversity at all levels of our organization, from entry-level analysts to senior management … is essential to our sustainability.” The Post has also reviewed a series of job openings with the firm at its lower Manhattan headquarters that ask candidates to state their preferred pronouns and their gender identity. Insiders at the bank said the answers are only supplied voluntarily. “A lot of people don’t bother with all this stuff anyway,” said one banker, who asked for their name to be withheld because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The bank’s 2023 ‘People Strategy’ Report stated Goldman wanted to achieve gender parity worldwide amongst its staff while setting targets in the US to ensure the payroll is 11% Black American and 14% Hispanic. The sea change on Wall Street comes after pressure from the White House as well as some activist investors who have filed motions urging shareholders to demand that the measures be rolled back. Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley have also scaled back their DEI commitments, while other major American corporate titans such as Ford and Disney have followed the same path. Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was secretly recorded earlier this month lashing out at policies such as “bias training.” Advertisement

SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. Technology company Nvidia will report fourth-quarter earnings today after the closing bell. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia, the chipmaker that fueled 22% of the S&P 500’s total returns in 2024 with a 171.25% stock surge, continues to ride the AI wave into 2025. Its latest quarterly earnings, released after market close Wednesday, showcase a company still firing on all cylinders—yet the market’s response hints at a maturing narrative. With the stock down 2.24% year-to-date entering earnings, investors are wrestling with whether Nvidia’s meteoric rise can sustain its momentum amid economic uncertainty and shifting tech priorities. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, covering the period ending January 26, 2025, smashed expectations. The company reported revenue of $39.3 billion, a 78% leap from $22.1 billion a year ago and a 12% increase from the prior quarter’s $35.1 billion, according to a press release issued by Nvidia. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share hit $0.89, up 82% year-over-year, while non-GAAP earnings per share matched at $0.89, a 71% annual gain. The data center segment, Nvidia’s AI powerhouse, soared to $35.6 billion, up 93% from last year, driven by booming demand for its Blackwell and Hopper GPU platforms. CEO Jensen Huang touted the results on the Q4 earnings call, saying, “Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law—increasing compute makes models smarter.” The Blackwell platform, ramping up to “massive-scale production,” contributed billions in sales this quarter alone, per Huang’s remarks. Since November 2024, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple have traded sideways, with all three posting negative year-to-date returns. The S&P 500, tethered to these giants, has stalled alongside them as the U.S. economy faces turbulence with incoming policy shifts—tariffs, tax changes, and deregulation—under a new administration. NVDA, AAPL, MSFT 12-Month Returns The two-year rally in Big Tech, propelled by artificial intelligence hype, could be hitting a ceiling as firms pivot from raw compute power to efficiency. Innovations like DeepSeek’s compute-light AI models suggest a future where Nvidia’s dominance might face pressure. Competitors such as AMD and Intel are developing alternatives to Nvidia’s AI offerings. AMD’s Instinct MI300 series has secured adoption in cloud computing environments. However, Nvidia’s ecosystem, supported by its CUDA software platform and established partnerships with major hyperscalers, continues to hold a leading position in the AI chip market. Optimists eyeing AI’s secular growth might see Nvidia’s dip as a buy signal, but broader exposure could be wiser. The Nasdaq and S&P 500—down 3.1% and 1.8% year-to-date, respectively, per today’s close, are laden with AI-adjacent firms, offering upside with less single-stock risk. Nvidia’s Q4 2024 earnings cement its AI supremacy—$130.5 billion in fiscal-year revenue, up 114%, speaks for itself. But as the market digests its maturity and braces for economic twists, the era of unchecked gains may be cooling. Investors should weigh diversification and patience in this volatile new chapter.

February 26, 2025 17:58 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Breitbart Business Digest: DEI Was Built on Fear; Now It’s Collapsing Under Reality

Bye, Bye American DEI The reckonings have been swift and dizzying. A dramatic and decisive shift is sweeping through corporate America, as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives crumble in the face of legal scrutiny, economic reality, and shifting public sentiment. What was once considered the inevitable march of corporate progressivism is now being reversed with stunning speed. Citigroup has eliminated race-based hiring quotas. Bank of America has followed suit. Goldman Sachs has abandoned its diversity mandate for IPOs. BlackRock, once a champion of DEI, has quietly stripped references to its diversity programs from corporate filings. Deloitte U.S. has told employees working on government contracts to remove gender pronouns from email signatures. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are rolling back DEI commitments as federal contractors. Even Amazon and Google, longtime standard-bearers of corporate progressivism, have purged DEI language from their reports and workforce policies. PBS has shuttered its DEI office entirely. What happened? Reality asserted itself. DEI programs, long protected by corporate inertia and the threat of activist pressure, have now run up against two immovable forces: the law and the bottom line. The Supreme Court’s ruling against affirmative action in college admissions made it clear that race-based decision-making in hiring was legally questionable at best. President Donald Trump’s executive order banning race and gender discrimination in federal contracting turned that into a direct threat to corporate balance sheets. Suddenly, compliance departments and general counsels had to take a hard look at policies that had long been implemented with little concern for legal exposure. Meanwhile, DEI’s economic toll was becoming harder to ignore. Despite years of corporate executives insisting that diversity initiatives boosted the bottom line, those claims never quite added up. Shareholders were left wondering why companies were prioritizing ideological agendas over maximizing returns. Employees grew resentful as hiring and promotions were increasingly dictated by identity rather than merit. Consumers, once silent, became vocal opponents of activist-driven corporate policies. The backlash was inevitable. This isn’t just a political correction. It’s a preference cascade—a moment when people and institutions rapidly abandon an ideology they once publicly supported but never truly believed in. History is full of such moments, where dominant narratives, long maintained through social pressure and enforced consensus, suddenly disintegrate. The medieval kings of Europe, for centuries, paid lip service to pagan gods while privately considering the growing influence of Christianity. Then, as soon as a key ruler—such as Clovis I of the Franks—converted, others quickly followed, exposing how fragile the old order had really been. Corporate America’s embrace of DEI functioned the same way: upheld not by deep conviction but by the fear of reputational ruin. Once a few key institutions abandoned it, the illusion of universal commitment crumbled overnight. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe followed a similar trajectory. The regimes of Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia seemed invincible—right up until the moment they weren’t. When Poland broke free in 1989, the chain reaction toppled East Germany, then the Soviet Union itself. The institutions of corporate DEI operated on the same model—an ideology enforced through intimidation and groupthink, rather than genuine consensus. The moment legal and economic incentives changed, corporations fled from it just as quickly as Eastern European states abandoned Marxism. Perhaps the most striking parallel, however, is with the rapid collapse of the eugenics movement. In the early 20th century, eugenics was considered the height of scientific progress, endorsed by leading intellectuals, politicians, and business leaders. Then came the horrors of World War II, and suddenly eugenics became a discredited ideology. Its former champions rewrote history, distancing themselves from the cause they had once fervently supported. The same pattern is emerging now with DEI. Companies that once prided themselves on their diversity pledges are quietly deleting the language from their websites, erasing references in annual reports, and pretending they were never all that invested in the first place. LGBTQ flag and Black Lives Matter banner on gym doors, Manhattan, New York. (Joan Slatkin/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) The media, predictably, is still catching up. The same outlets that once insisted the corporate DEI revolution was irreversible now publish cautious stories about companies “re-evaluating” their commitments. But the scale of this shift goes far beyond a temporary recalibration. This is not a pause. It is a full-scale retreat, a regime collapse. And it’s not just DEI that is falling. On Tuesday, Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and founder of Amazon, announced that the paper’s opinion pages will now be dedicated to defending “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos declared that opposing viewpoints can be “published elsewhere.” The left’s hold on our cultural institutions is being broken just as its hold on corporate America and Washington, D.C. has fallen. Of course, no entrenched ideology surrenders overnight. DEI has spent years embedding itself into corporate HR departments, government agencies, and university bureaucracies. The activists, consultants, and executives who built their careers around it will fight to preserve it. They will litigate, regulate, and pressure corporations to reverse course. They will frame this retreat as a “temporary setback” rather than a lasting correction. But the problem for DEI’s defenders is that preference cascades, once set in motion, do not reverse themselves easily. The same companies that once feared activist outrage now fear consumer backlash and shareholder scrutiny. The political winds have changed, the legal landscape has shifted, and the economic incentives are no longer in DEI’s favor. And this retreat from DEI and related left-wing policies is not just a political reaction. It is a structural correction. The same forces that fueled the rise of these policies—activist pressure, legal blind spots, and corporate groupthink—have now collapsed under the weight of scrutiny. Which means this shift is unlikely to be reversed. Unlike the left-wing ideological wave of 2020—which was fueled by emotion, activism, and media hype—this movement is driven by lawsuits, economic reality, and consumer behavior. DEI was an imposed orthodoxy, sustained by the fear of bad PR and the inertia of corporate groupthink. Once that spell is broken, there’s no putting it back together.

Title: Aftering waiting with bated breath, Wall Street absorbs Nvidia's latest earnings

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Rarely has a single company's earnings report been so closely watched by Wall Street as a make-or-break moment for the broader market. Nvidia, the chipmaker whose central role in the global artificial intelligence arms race has turned it into one of the world's most valuable companies, reported its much-anticipated quarterly results Wednesday. It posted $39.3 billion in revenue, up a hefty 78% for the quarter that ended in January and ahead of analysts' expectations. But for many investors and analysts, the wildly profitable company's financials reveal more than just the state of Nvidia's own operations. And many are likely to take notice of the chipmaker's forward-looking statements Wednesday, which signaled slowing profit-margin growth. The chip giant's importance is due to two major factors: its sizable valuation (meaning that its stock price can weigh heavily on the market as a whole, including the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average) and its role in the AI sector (which now factors heavily into broader U.S. economic growth). Ahead of the earnings, Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said it would be a "massive day" for global markets looking to "gauge the demand trajectory of the AI Revolution." Among X's more finance- and tech-focused crowd, the earnings had caused enough anticipation to spark some tongue-in-cheek jokes. As if to underscore just how on edge traders were, Nvidia's stock price swung higher and then lower and then higher again in the minutes right after the report came out. As of about 5 p.m. ET, the shares were up about 2% from where they closed Wednesday afternoon. Brand-name tech firms looking to build out their AI capabilities have purchased Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) chips by the heap — a buying spree that has turbocharged the company's share price. Between the start of 2023 and the end of 2024, Nvidia's stock climbed some 880%, making it at the time the most valuable publicly traded U.S. firm, with a market capitalization over $3 trillion. Thanks to that surge, Nvidia is now the second-most-important component of the S&P 500 index, behind only Apple. Nvidia's earnings are heavily scrutinized as a barometer for the economy at large, the growth of which during the past two years has been powered in large part by investments in AI and data center capacity. Yet so far this year, Nvidia shares were down 5% heading into its earnings report amid growing doubts about whether the breakneck pace of global AI investment could be sustained. This week, a report emerged that Microsoft, one of Nvidia's largest customers, was pulling back on its data-center spending. Microsoft has since denied that — and many of Nvidia's other key customers, including Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and Amazon, all plan to make significant investments. Nvidia, and the AI landscape in general, has also been shaken by the seemingly sudden rise of DeepSeek, a China-backed AI platform that reportedly requires far fewer computing resources — and mostly taps chips made by Nvidia rival Intel. More broadly, the U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown amid questions about the strength of consumers and the prospect of higher inflation tied to President Donald Trump's plans to impose tariffs.

Title: SCB offers more overseas wealth options

Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) is increasing access to international wealth products for Thai investors, aiming to expand assets under management (AUM) in foreign currencies to 180 billion baht by 2026. Under its wealth management division, SCB Wealth, the bank collaborates with subsidiaries of parent SCB X and global partners to drive business growth. According to chief executive Kris Chantanotoke, the bank offers a diverse range of global asset classes to facilitate Thai investors entering international markets. SCB's plan to expand its AUM in foreign currencies to 180 billion baht by 2026 aligns with projections that Thai wealth will grow to roughly US$1 trillion in the interim. The bank declined to disclose its current AUM and the total wealth of its Thai investors. According to Mr Kris, SCB X's subsidiaries and the bank's global partners supporting this business segment comprise SCB Asset Management, Innovest X, SCB Economic Intelligence Center, SCB Julius Baer, and its latest partner BlackRock. SCB Wealth serves three market segments: SCB Private, SCB First and SCB Prime. SCB Wealth offers a comprehensive suite of investment products and services, including deposits, lending, investments, estate planning, protection and tax planning. In addition to its existing wealth clients, the bank extends its services to "mass affluent" clients interested in portfolio investments, granting them access to global asset classes. Investment access is tailored to client needs, with options available through relationship managers or digital platforms. SCB wants to double AUM under its customer-centric investment theme by 2026 from 70 billion baht at present. The bank also plans to double the proportion of active wealth management clients investing through its digital platform, increasing their share to 30% of the total customer portfolio. "We aim to position SCB Wealth as the industry leader in terms of assets under advisory," said Mr Kris. SCB Wealth also introduced a unique investment model called "No Gain, No Pay" for select investment themes. Under this approach, if clients fail to achieve their targeted returns, the bank will waive the investment fees.

Title: Nvidia beats fiscal fourth quarter expectations on Blackwell demand

Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) revenue and outlook topped analysts’ expectations, driven by demand for its new Blackwell chips. The stock fluctuated in after-hours trading after closing up 3.7%. The chipmaker reported revenue of $39.3 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter — a 78% increase from the previous year and an all-time high. Consensus had been for $38.1 billion. Net income was $22 billion for earnings per share of 89 cents, also beats. Nvidia’s full-year revenue more than doubled year over year to $130.5 billion. Revenue guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal year was set at $43 billion, plus or minus 2% — also above Wall Street’s expectations of $42 billion. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. He called demand for the new chips “amazing” as companies roll out reasoning AI models. The company’s gross margins will be in the low 70s, but is expected to return to the mid-70s later in the fiscal year as Blackwell fully ramps up, CFO Colette Kress said on Nvidia’s earnings call. Nvidia’s data center revenue rose 93% year on year to a record $35.6 billion last quarter. However, data center sales in China remain low due to restrictions, Kress said, adding that the company will continue complying with chip export controls. Ahead of the earnings, analysts were optimistic that the chipmaker would beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up production of its Blackwell chips — despite shockwaves from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. In December, Hangzhou-based DeepSeek released a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. The startup’s powerful reasoning model, R1, spooked investors in January, causing Nvidia’s stock to plunge 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told Quartz ahead of the results. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet.” Encouraging updates on production and shipments of the Blackwell platform will probably move the stock, Kunjan Sobhani, lead semiconductor analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Quartz ahead of earnings. Investors are wary of a potential “air pocket” in growth between the first and second quarters of the current fiscal year as customers move to Blackwell from Hopper, he said. “That is the spot when the Hopper shipments could really come down, and the Blackwell ramp — from a quarter to quarter perspective — might not be enough to show significant sequential growth,” Sobhani said, adding that Blackwell could “catch up in the second half.” For Nvidia’s reputation and valuation, “the sequential expectations matter,” Sobhani said. “If they say something which agitates this sort of concern further, that could imply temporary volatility in the sentiment and the stock.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported revenue for the fourth quarter ended January 26, 2025, of $39.3 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and up 78% from a year ago. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.89, up 14% from the previous quarter and up 82% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.89, up 10% from the previous quarter and up 71% from a year ago. For fiscal 2025, revenue was $130.5 billion, up 114% from a year ago. GAAP earnings per diluted share was $2.94, up 147% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $2.99, up 130% from a year ago. “Demand for Blackwell is amazing as reasoning AI adds another scaling law — increasing compute for training makes models smarter and increasing compute for long thinking makes the answer smarter,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter. AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.” NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share on April 2, 2025, to all shareholders of record on March 12, 2025. Q4 Fiscal 2025 Summary Fiscal 2025 Summary *All per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the ten-for-one stock split, which was effective June 7, 2024. Outlook NVIDIA’s outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows: Highlights NVIDIA achieved progress since its previous earnings announcement in these areas: Data Center Gaming and AI PC Professional Visualization Automotive and Robotics CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2026. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The price of Bitcoin dropped more than 6% in 24 hours to break below $84,000 on Wednesday. Notably, Bitcoin price has touched its lowest levels since November 2024, when it rose amid election momentum. According to crypto and stocks trader IncomeSharks, the market is bearish. BTC sold-off as the crypto market reacted to trade war sentiment, with this coming on the heels of the latest tariffs announcement by President Donald Trump. Having announced that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China will go into effect in April, Trump said he would slap 25% tariffs on the European Union. The news saw the S&P 500 fall, with over $500 billion in market cap wiped off. As equities reacted to the potential trade war, Bitcoin crashed below $84,000. Per data from CoinMarketCap, the price of BTC hit lows of $82,131. BTC price also dumped amid massive selling pressure from ETFs. Major issuers Fidelity, Ark and Grayscale all sold. BlackRock, which sent millions of dollars worth of BTC and ETH to an exchange on Tuesday, also offloaded $150 million of the flagship coin.

U.S. stocks gave up their early gains to close mixed on Wednesday as U.S. bond yields fell again amid confusing comments from Donald Trump about tariffs on Canada and Mexico and after more lackluster economic data. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) stock ended up 3.67% ahead of its earnings later today. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes were little changed and the Dow Jones Industrial average lost about 188 points. Apple (AAPL+0.89%) stock fell 2.7% and Tesla (TSLA+3.07%) closed about 4% lower at $290.80, giving up earlier gains. The president pushed back the deadline for tariffs on the U.S.’s neighbors to April 2 from March 4. While this buoyed the Mexican peso and the loonie, it left investors uncertain and skeptical about Trump’s actual plans for duties, and may have reduced the issue’s importance for traders going forward. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock surged after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year. Shares of AppLovin (APP+1.17%), the top-performing technology stock of 2024, plunged after an attack by two short-sellers. Data released in the morning showed sales of new single-family homes in January 2025 were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000, missing the consensus for 680,000 and down 10.5% from December’s upwardly revised 734,000.

Many big American companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's pushback on DEI, but none of their steps carry more symbolic weight than a retreat by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. An early advocate of diversity, equity, and inclusion, BlackRock has removed all mention of the strategy from its latest annual report. The asset manager and its CEO, Larry Fink, have over the years become targets for Republicans who claim the firm is too "woke." What was the DEI section in the asset manager's last report has now been reframed as "connectivity and inclusivity" in the Tuesday filing. Last year, it said that it believed "a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture is a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success." This year it avoided mentioning the acronym or a diverse workforce, just "diverse perspectives." When reached for comment, a BlackRock spokesman referred to the new paragraph in its annual report that said the firm's approach to "building a connected and inclusive culture is aligned with the firm's business priorities and long-term objectives. Delivering for the firm's clients requires attracting the best people from across the world. "BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink." BlackRock has also removed references to a three-pillar strategy, which included phrasing around cultivating a work environment where employees felt "seen, heard, valued, and respected." The firm left out a section that previously broke down its US employees by gender and ethnicity. In its 2023 annual review, it introduced the statistics with a line saying that "BlackRock views transparency and measurement as critical to its strategy." Companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's executive order on "radical and wasteful" DEI programs, though a few big names such as JPMorgan Chase and Costco have reaffirmed their commitment to diversity initiatives. Through his annual investor letters, Fink promoted stakeholder capitalism and environmental, social, and governance investing, becoming the unofficial corporate poster child for the movements. In the last few years, however, Fink has had to tone down his support for ESG and defend against the idea that the firm has an ideological agenda it's forcing on the many companies it invests in through its mutual funds and ETFs. The firm also has critics on the political left. Climate activists have previously protested outside Fink's home and BlackRock's New York headquarters, calling for a divestment from fossil fuels. "The only agenda we have is delivering for our clients," he said in 2023 LinkedIn post, which he drafted as a response to being called the "king of the woke industrial complex" in a Republican Party presidential candidate debate. October 2017: Former Obama aide (and future Biden administration member) Brian Deese is named head of sustainable investments. November 2017: As part of a panel at the New York Times DealBook conference, Fink was asked about how diversity and inclusion are becoming investment criteria. He responded by saying that hiring behaviors will have to change, and they're talking to companies about it. (The clip, where he said, "You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors," went viral among conservative circles in 2023.) November 2018: The world's largest asset manager asks Russell 1000 companies with less than two female board members to improve their gender diversity. January 2020: Fink's annual letter, coming out just months before the COVID-19 pandemic reached New York, stated the company's focus is now on "putting sustainability at the center of how we invest." Fink wrote that "ultimately, purpose is the engine of long-term profitability." June 2020: Gavin Lewis, a managing director at BlackRock in the UK, starts the #IAM campaign after George Floyd's murder in Minnesota, and Lewis, a Black man, becomes one of the most well-known advocates for people of color in finance. January 2021: Fink lays out the firm's DEI strategy in his annual letter, which includes more inclusive hiring practices as well as a focus on "racial equity and social justice in our investment and stewardship activities. April 2021: After a Minneapolis jury convicted police officer Derek Chauvin of murder in the death of George Floyd, Fink wrote on LinkedIn that he hoped the country could begin to heal. "At BlackRock, we are committed to driving diversity, equity and inclusion through every aspect of our business. While we have made progress, we still have a great deal of work to do," he wrote. "This is a somber day and one for deep reflection. As I look to the future, I am committed to ensuring that BlackRock does its part to contribute to a more just and inclusive society." January 2022: Larry says that stakeholder capitalism is "not woke" in response to conservative politicians' criticism that the company is pushing its politics on companies through its heft. June 2023: Fink officially stopped using the acronym ESG because it was being politically "weaponized." Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, he said he was ashamed to be part of the conversation and that ESG has been "misused by the far left and the far right." December 2023: In a debate for the GOP nomination for president, Vivek Ramaswamy called Fink "king of the woke industrial complex, the ESG movement, and the CEO of BlackRock, the most powerful company in the world." Fink responded in a LinkedIn post saying "We make decisions based on our clients' best interests, not political or ideological agendas." December 2024: Following Trump's election, BlackRock tones down the language on its board diversity policy. The updated policy removes a numerical target for gender diversity — which had previously been 30% of members being diverse, with at least two female directors and one director from an underrepresented group. A footnote suggests that BlackRock thinks 30% is still the expectation, but the updated policy also removed the need for companies to explain why their board is not more diverse. January 2025: The firm told clients it had withdrawn from the United Nations coalition Net Zero Asset Managers weeks before Trump's second inauguration. The firm's vice chair, Philipp Hildebrand, told clients that the coalition and other climate-related entanglements had "subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials" — a reference to lawsuits state attorneys general from oil-producing areas of the US such as Texas had filed against BlackRock over its stance on sustainable investing. These states though appear to be interested in more than just BlackRock's energy policies; Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a letter to the asset manager, as well as other big-name financial firms, to understand their DEI policies.

Choose your location By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Dear MAGA voters: President Donald Trump thanks you for your service, but he has determined you are now expendable. Please enjoy your Denny’s omelet surcharge and keep buying MAGA merchandise and Trump family cryptocurrency! If Trump was capable of honesty, that’s the note his supporters would be getting. It would be better than the “So long, suckers” message the president is sending via his administration’s priorities and reckless actions. Outside of some draconian actions on immigration and transgender rights , the kind of cruelty he promised his base, consider where we’re at since Trump has taken office. An unelected billionaire – Elon Musk – is ripping though the federal government like he owns the place, firing workers right and left, including thousands of veterans while the Republican Congress just watches. Trump has been musing about taking over Gaza and Greenland and the Panama Canal and Canada while siding with Russia and alienating America’s strongest allies in Europe. His scattershot tariffs have created economic uncertainty, rattling the stock market and leading to economic reports like this, from Reuters: “The Conference Board said consumer confidence deteriorated in February at its fastest pace in three-and-a-half years, with estimates for 12-month domestic inflation surging amid worries that U.S. tariffs on imports would raise prices for households.” Opinion: Musk email requires federal employees to list 5 things they did last week. Allow me. On Tuesday, the head of Alcoa, a Pittsburgh-based aluminum company, said Trump’s tariffs on aluminum imports could result in 100,000 job losses in the industry. CEO William Oplinger said: “It’s bad for American workers.” I’m sorry, but I was told electing Trump would be good for American workers. In fact, I was told specifically that food prices would swiftly go down and that the country would waltz into a new Golden Age . Well, it’s looking increasingly like that was – GASP! – a lie, and once Trump won the election and was able to do away with his myriad legal issues, he immediately abandoned the “ forgotten men and women ” he so sincerely promised to champion and went straight to helping himself and his fellow billionaires. Your Turn: Trump shows how many Americans are racist. Even when they don't think they are. | Opinion Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts summed it up on the House floor Tuesday while speaking out about a GOP budget that will, among other things, gut the Medicaid program many Trump voters rely on: “We all saw this coming. ... Last month, Trump’s inauguration, who was in the front row? It wasn't people on Medicaid. It wasn't factory workers. It wasn't nurses or teachers or firefighters. It wasn't even his own Cabinet. It was the richest people in the world.” For any forgotten men and women of America, that should have been a red flag. Trump had won on the backs of Americans who bought into his dishonest populist message. And since he got what he wanted, since he saved his own hide, the people who matter are clearly the ones with money. So in comes Musk, deemed brilliant by virtue of wealth. His smug talk of “wokeness” and diversity, equity and inclusion might trigger the pleasure centers of MAGA supporters. But they’re learning Musk’s ax is swinging for necks that include their own. Consider what Fox News’ Jesse Watters , a Trump toady if there ever was one, said after realizing that a friend of his – “a guy I met at a shooting event in New Jersey” – who is a 20-year military veteran about to get laid off from the Pentagon by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE: “He texted me and he said, ’Jesse, you know, this isn't good. I’m upset. This is really sad.’ And this guy is not a DEI consultant. This guy is not a climate consultant. This guy is a veteran. So when you’re talking about DOGE-ing people, veterans should get priority. Because if you’re going to go out there and kill enemies, put your life on the line for this country, you shouldn't be in the same category as people that are doing DEI.” Previously on Fox News, Watters had squawked excitedly about the DOGE firings , saying things like “DOGE is dishing out spankings like ‘Daddy Daycare’ ”; “There was a huge exodus over at the National Archives, persnickety librarians were getting DOGE’d silly”; and “DOGE is a blessing from the heavens above.” You see how that works? It’s all good when it somehow relates to Watters’ definition of “others,” but not when it involves someone he knows – one of those “real Americans,” I suppose. And of course he overlooks the fact that veterans have long been considered a part of the “diversity” in DEI . As the tens of thousands of federal layoffs continue , Trump voters are going to feel the impact more acutely in their own communities and social circles. We’re talking about an enormous number of people about to be out of work, and there will be veterans and MAGA supporters among them, cast off from their jobs and forced to reckon with food prices that haven’t gone down and federal services – like Medicaid – that may well dry up.

And assuredly, he’ll still do his best to fleece the diehards with dodgy crypto investments and any other thing he can slap his name on and sell. But for all intents and purposes, he’s done with you all. He cares only about the billionaires who line his Cabinet and his own personal fortune.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Companies around America have started cutting DEI programs and eliminating DEI commitments from public documents in response to legal and political threats from the Trump administration. Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds. Trump has signed an executive order banning DEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI. The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASA has started to scrub mention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBS had to shutter its DEI office. In corporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it would ditch its requirement for corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color. Other companies are trying to strike a balance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorgan have indicated a commitment to sticking with their diversity efforts. Last year, companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforce started scrubbing mentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025. We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment. Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removed a post from 2021 that expressed a focus on DEI and removed some mentions of diversity from its latest annual 10-K report. In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.” Apple’s website still says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.” Shareholders at Apple’s latest meeting rejected a proposal from a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal. Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it’s done since 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI. Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared to the eight times it was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year, it removed many cultural events from the default Google Calendar. IBM still has its inclusion page up. Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation requested the company drop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal. Intel cut back some of the language about DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, the company still states that “diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.” Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported by Axios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment. Microsoft released its 2024 inclusion report in October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according to a memo leaked to Business Insider. Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.” OpenAI quietly changed its “Commitment to Diversity” website to now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page. Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration. Although Salesforce swabbed mention of its diversity targets in its 2023 10-K filing, it still released a 2024 “equality update.” In that update, the company reiterated its commitment to diverse representation and how much more it still needs to achieve. In a conversation with Axios recently, CEO Marc Benioff said he would stand by his employees amid the Trump administration’s anti-DEI orders. Tesla scrubbed mention of diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only released one diversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020. Although Workday erased mention of diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a 2024 Global Impact Report and it still has a chief diversity officer. Zoom laid off its DEI team during a round of layoffs last year, telling staff it would work with external consultants who will engage “all of our employees,” while focusing on “inclusion,” according to a memo leaked to Bloomberg. It doesn’t appear to have released a diversity report since 2022, the first of which came out in 2020, according to its website.

Posted on 02/26/2025 11:27:04 AM PST by RandFan Keir Starmer has announced that Britain will “fight for peace in Europe” with a generational increase in defence spending paid for by slashing the foreign aid budget. The move, just two days before the prime minister is due to meet Donald Trump, raised immediate concerns that he was pandering to the US president, and fury from aid groups that say it could cost lives in countries that rely on UK support. In a surprise announcement, Starmer announced the biggest increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war, with the budget rising to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 – three years earlier than planned – and an ambition to reach 3%. Cabinet ministers are among those who voiced concern over plans to cut aid spending by 40%, after Trump’s own drastic cuts to the US aid budget. Several warned in a cabinet meeting of the risk of unintended consequences. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said earlier this month that the US plan could be a “big strategic mistake” that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence.

By Trump getting in there with his own deal, even if the minerals Z still has to bargain worth arent really all that much, he not only blocks other foreign nations but also snubs the spark the British are trying to light and helps to cut off the banks from dragging us into future wars there.

Let them burn, we should have NEVER bailed them out of “The Great War”, or WW II if it would have even happened. If BritAID is as pernicious as USAID, the world will be a better place without it.

Title: Owners of McSorley’s in Ranelagh finalising deal to take over Wild Goose restaurant

The new owners of well-known McSorley’s pub in Ranelagh are finalising a deal to take over the Wild Goose restaurant space above the pub, with a view to making it a seven-days-a-week food and drinks business. In an interview with Inside Business, a podcast by The Irish Times, publican Noel Anderson, the managing director of Grand Slam Bars, said: “Our plan would be to grow it more as a seven day a week business. We’ve just done a deal with the guy who runs a restaurant upstairs. We’re taking that back, the deal is just being finalised. “We plan on putting our own food into it, growing the food trade there, growing the cocktail trade and having a super events space upstairs. We’re excited about that.” He said the fit-out would cost hundreds of thousands of euro. “But I think it will be worth it. We own the building, it’s a long-term investment and we’re excited about what the future holds in Ranelagh.” The restaurant is currently occupied by the Wild Goose Grill, which is run by proprietor Kevin McMahon and is slated to close at the end of March. McSorley’s was purchased for €5.5 million in the middle of last year by Grand Slam Bars, which is owned by Mr Anderson and former Irish rugby internationals, Rob Kearney, Dave Kearney, Jamie Heaslip and Sean O’Brien. They also own The Bridge 1859 in Ballsbridge, the Blackrock pub, and the Lemon & Duke and Little Lemon venues in the city centre. The group employs more than 200 staff with combined revenues of about €11 million, Mr Andseron said. Food makes up about €4m million a year of its turnover. “Food is a big part of what we do now and that’s probably a lot of where the future lies,” he said. Mr Anderson is also a shareholder in the Changing Times Brewery, which is making local stout and lager. Mr Anderson said McSorleys would continue be a “late focused” bar but having the space upstairs. “What’s exciting for us is that on big rugby days you will get business all day and all night as well,” he said.

February 26, 2025 13:33 ET | Source: The Gross Law Firm The Gross Law Firm NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Gross Law Firm issues the following notice to shareholders of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). Shareholders who purchased shares of MRK during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/merck-co-inc-loss-submission-form/?id=132052&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study.

Euro zone government bond yields held near their lowest in over a week as traders eyed hurdles to an expected increase in European defence spending. Dublin Shares at Glanbia dropped over 23 per cent on a day when the Irish food group flagged an anticipated fall in earnings of up to 11 per cent due to the rising cost of a key ingredient in its protein powder products. It closed at €11.20. In the banking sector, AIB and Bank of Ireland both gained, the former closing up 1.7 per cent at €6.56, and the latter by 1.26 per cent to finish at €11.23.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 rose 0.7 per cent to its highest since February 19th. Banks were the biggest boost to the index, with mortgage lender Lloyds gaining 4.6 per cent after at least two brokerages raised their price target on the stock. Metro Bank rose 4.3 per cent after the lender said it had signed an agreement to sell a portfolio of about £584 million (€706 million) of unsecured personal loans. Glencore gained 2 per cent, Anglo American rose 3.5 per cent and Antofagasta was up 3.6 per cent. The midcap FTSE 250 also gained 0.7 per cent.

Europe European shares closed at a record high as corporate earnings took centre stage and investors assessed the impact of a critical US-Ukraine minerals agreement. “Trump is creating a lot of uncertainty with tariffs and the politics he is doing. So people are just trying to position and be invested on the right side if a trade war should come,” said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 1 per cent, boosted by banks for a second consecutive session. Insurers followed with a 2.4 per cent gain after Germany’s Munich Re posted an annual operating profit that beat estimates. Germany’s mid-cap stocks hit their highest level in over six months, boosted by optimism around pro-growth policies and higher defence spending from the next government. The European aerospace and defence index was up 1.5 per cent. Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) jumped 8.9% after it reported fourth-quarter operating profit above analysts' forecasts.

AI chip leader Nvidia gained 4.4 per cent, while peers Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices also rose, driving the broader semiconductor index 2.6 per cent higher. Nvidia’s quarterly results and forecasts, expected after markets close, are likely to set the tone for artificial intelligence stocks that have dominated Wall Street. Megacaps were mixed, with Meta Platforms up 3 per cent and Apple down 2 per cent. Tesla rose 1.2 per cent a day after the electric-vehicle maker’s market value fell below $1 trillion.

Title: BlackRock, Bank of America drop DEI policies amid White House’s war on ‘woke’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/business/blackrock-bank-of-america-drop-dei-policies-amid-white-houses-war-on-woke/
Time Published: 2025-02-26T18:01:21Z
Full Content:
BlackRock and Bank of America dropped their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies — becoming the latest Wall Street giants to scrap the controversial initiative after the White House declared war on woke in corporate America. Regulatory filings reviewed by The Post show that Larry Fink’s BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.4 trillion under management, and the Brian Moynihan-led lender have axed language that promoted the representation and participation of different minority groups. The moves follow a crackdown led by President Donald Trump on DEI in the workplace, tasking Attorney General Pam Bondi in a Jan. 21 executive order that asked her to stamp out the practice. Bondi then vowed in a Feb. 5 memo that her DOJ would “investigate, eliminate, and penalize” such policies in the private sector. BlackRock, in its latest annual report filed late Tuesday, said that the company’s business “requires attracting the best people from across the world.” “BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink,” the report added. That represents a huge climbdown for the Democrat-donating CEO, who joined the chorus of Wall Street executives backing DEI in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020 and the Black Lives Matter movement. In a letter to shareholders in 2021, Fink claimed: “To truly drive change, we must embed DEI into everything we do.” The Post has reached out to Blackrock for comment. BofA also backed off the much-criticized DEI policies in its annual report filed on Tuesday evening, formally ending the requirements for hiring and interviewing bankers. “We are deliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone hasthe opportunity to achieve their career goals,” the Charlotte-based firm wrote. A rep for Bank of America confirmed that was no longer company policy. “We evaluate and adjust our programs in light of new laws, court decisions, and, more recently, executive orders from the new administration,” a bank spokesperson said. “Our goal has been and continues to be to make opportunities available for all of our clients, shareholders, teammates, and the communities we serve.” The rollback of DEI by the two giants of American finance echoes what some of their rivals have been doing since Trump trounced Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 in the race for the White House. Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley have also scaled back their DEI commitments, while Goldman Sachs recently canceled a requirement to only take companies public if they had two diverse board members. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon seemingly remains an outlier, insisting on Monday that nation’s largest bank would stand by its diversity policies, despite lashing out at DEI initiatives in a leaked recording of a town hall meeting with Chase employees. Dimon told the audience that he “was never a firm believer in bias training” and blasted how the company was “spending money on some of this stupid shit.” The Wall Street giant also scrubbed much of its DEI language in its recent annual report to investors, further confirming the shift in mood at America’s major banks. “Everyone in my industry wants diversity in their teams and a workplace that reflects society at large, but everybody on Wall Street privately agrees that the DEI doctrine had started to actually go too far. People have been afraid to speak up,” said Dan McCarthy, a veteran Wall Street headhunter and CEO of the specialist global search firm, One Search. “My clients are still hiring diversity and they are telling us that they want to continue to hire diversity,” McCarthy, the head of the Young Women Into Finance non-profit, added. “But some DEI policies became toxic to the point where they became discriminatory. It feels like we are starting to see more common sense around it.” Advertisement

Title: Wall Street’s DEI Retreat: Where Major Banks and Asset Managers Stand

Time Published: 2025-02-26T17:44:25Z

As Wall Street navigates the shifting landscape of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), some firms quietly retreat while others make just enough adjustments to sidestep political backlash. Bank of America (BAC), BlackRock (BLK) and Citigroup (C) have publicly scaled back DEI commitments, while Capital One (COF) appears to be walking a fine line, paring down efforts without making headlines. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), on the other hand, remains committed to broad DEI goals but is cutting back on certain spending. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Much like Big Tech companies, the financial sector embraced DEI in 2020 amid national protests over racial justice, pledging to address systemic disparities through hiring initiatives and investment strategies. However, with shifting political climates, banks are reassessing those commitments. The pressure is mounting as the Trump administration signals its intent to dismantle DEI initiatives across industries, from finance to education. Here’s how recent filings and statements from major U.S. banks and asset managers reveal a broader industry shift away from DEI: In its annual report filed yesterday (Feb. 25), the world’s largest asset manager deleted references to its “three pillar DEI strategy,” which included diversity commitments in talent and culture, client and business partnerships, and social impact and policy. Instead, the report included a statement, under a new section called “connectivity and inclusivity,” saying the firm is “committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink.” Bank of America, which also filed its annual report yesterday, removed all references to “diversity and inclusion” mentioned in its 2023 report. In a few places, the bank replaced the word “diversity” with “opportunity.” For example, the “diversity and inclusion group” under the bank’s human resources department has been renamed “opportunity and inclusion group.” “We have diversity and inclusion at our company. But, step back: We’ve always been the bank of opportunity,” CEO Brian Moynihan said at an event in Washington D.C. yesterday when asked about the bank’s DEI policy. In its latest annual report, U.S. Bank’s parent company, U.S. Bancorp, quietly removed the previous year’s overview of its DEI efforts, including the mention of its business resource groups, which supported minority employees. It also removed a pledge that the bank would include at least one woman or person of color on interview slates for all roles. The bank also scrubbed its staff diversity data. The previous year, the document specified that 57 percent of its U.S. employees were women and 39 percent were people of color. The latest filing had no such mention. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that U.S. Bancorp is about to have its first woman of color CEO. The bank’s president, Gunjan Kedia, who is Indian American, is set to take over as CEO in April. In a “Colleague Engagement Update” published Feb. 20, Citigroup announced it “will no longer have aspirational representation goals except as required by local law.” The bank also said it will no longer require diverse slates of candidates and interviewers. The move is a direct result of recent changes in U.S. federal government policy, Citigroup said. Morgan Stanley (MS)’s latest annual report didn’t include the “Diversity and Inclusion” section that was featured in previous years’ filings. However, the report retains a link to the company’s “Diversity & Inclusion” landing page, which is still live. The bank’s only DEI-related statements are nested under a section dubbed “Human Capital,” which contains the stated value of committing to “diversity and inclusion” but now also mentions “meritocracy”—a call to President Trump’s advocacy for “merit-based opportunities” across industries. Similarly, Capital One’s latest annual report also no longer features the previous year’s “Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging” (DIB) section. While a brief mention of “pay equity” remains, the bank’s promise to pay women and employees of color “100 percent” what men and White employees are paid is notably absent. Capital One’s website still features a “Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging” statement and a “Supplier Diversity Program,” whose goal is “to include qualified diverse businesses in every sourcing opportunity based on commodity need wherever these suppliers exist.” JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., firmly sticks to its DEI commitments despite political pressure. In its latest annual report, the bank said it “has been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning business practices or positions taken by JPMorgan Chase with respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives).” However, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that some DEI programs are wasteful and said the bank would scale back spending on them while maintaining its broader DEI commitments. Similarly, Goldman Sachs (GS) states on its website that it remains “committed to making progress toward racial equity, advancing gender equality, and increasing representation at every level of our firm.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Apple said the 250,000-square foot Texas factory will support its Apple Intelligence AI model and will open in 2026. Apple said the $500 billion investment plan marks its largest-ever spend commitment, and includes creating a manufacturing academy and doubling the size of its US advanced manufacturing fund. Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday plans to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years on a swath of investments, including hiring 20,000 new workers to make artificial intelligence servers in a new Texas-based factory. Apple called the investment plan its "largest-ever spend committment." It announced plans to open—with partners—a new factory in Houston, Texas, that will build AI servers previously made outside the U.S. and create a manufacturing academy in Michigan. The iPhone maker said the investment would also fund the acceleration of investments in AI and research & development into silicon engineering as well as double the size of its U.S. advanced manufacturing fund—which supports "innovation and high-skilled manufacturing" jobs in the country—to $10 billion. The plan by the iPhone maker comes as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and hiked those on Chinese products to incentivise companies to produce goods domestically. Apple said it plans to hire around 20,000 people in the next four years for the Houston facility, most of whom will be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development, and AI and machine learning.

Thanks to Sarah Lamont and Jaylen Darling for their contributions Everyone talks about the $84.4T great wealth transfer in the context of liquid assets expected to be passed down over the next 20 years. However, fewer people are addressing the $15.5T in private business wealth that is much more operationally complex and obviously harder to inherit. SBA Office of Advocacy, Cerulli Associates, Federal Reserve, F-Prime Analysis Despite retirement-aged owners (boomers and older) owning 63.1 percent ($9.78T) of the private business wealth — $4.25T of which we estimate is distributed amongst small business owners with less than 500 employees — the inherent problems of transferring this portion of wealth creates ample market opportunity for startups in this space to address. For instance, only about 52 percent of heirs claim to actually want the family business which is exacerbated by the fact that the smaller the business, the less likely owners are to engage in exit planning. Stats like these suggest that many retiring SMB owners will need to consider alternative exit strategies outside of passing down their business to their children. More and more retiring owners will likely be selling their business to external buyers, which comes with a vast amount of challenges and pain points for both sellers and buyers. The challenges and pain points that SMB sellers and buyers face are vast: F-Prime Analysis Numerous players are adding value along the process of business ownership transfer from document preparation to deal execution. Acquisition marketplaces like Beacon, Get Acquired, and Tresle are aggregating demand and providing value through free valuation estimation calculators, access to advisors that facilitate deal transactions, and an anonymous listings platform that allows sellers to “match” with and approve prospective buyer inquiries. Companies like Boom are supporting companies in the early selling phase, helping owners with key management issues and valuation services to get businesses ready for the marketplace. Baton which just raised $10M in Series A funding and Tresle’s Plus product offers custom marketing assets for sellers; Beacon vets their buyers even going so far as to conduct background checks in specific cases; and Baton and Acquire.com provide a virtual “data room” to standardize document review and initial due diligence. Buyer-focused acquisition marketplaces are also providing unique value-adds. Companies like Private Market Labs leverage AI to gather a database of on-market small business deals for buyers. OffDeal leverages AI to match and connect buyers with the best off-market acquisition targets. Village Wellth boasts a financing solutions product, Aquirewell, that links buyers with advisors to review financials and structure deals as well as assess their lending readiness and find the best lending options by connecting them with multiple lenders. Boopos offers acquisition financing loans for recurring revenue businesses. Alternatively, business owners who don’t want to sell their business to external buyers can consider employee ownership transfer as an alternative exit strategy. Employee ownership as an exit strategy refers to an owner selling their majority stake in the business to the employees either directly or indirectly. There are multiple types of employee ownership structures with the most common model in the US being Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), with over 6,000 companies and favorable tax incentives. While each employee ownership type has its own tax and governance incentives, across the board employee ownership has shown to be a viable and compelling exit strategy that results in a preserved legacy and company culture and potential for ongoing involvement or gradual transition for the selling owner going through an already emotional process of selling their business. Common Trust is one startup that is taking advantage of the market opportunity by helping owners design and execute an employee ownership buyout using a customized purpose trust — an Employee Ownership Trust (EOT) — that is cheaper than its more regulated ESOP counterpart. Startups in the space have the opportunity to get in front of selling owners who value company legacy preservation, tax benefits, and the flexibility of selling internally vs to external buyers. F-Prime Analysis On the other hand, the not-so-pretty side of business ownership transfer is that not all of them succeed. Companies like SimpleClosure and Sunset are addressing the clean up process for a sliver of the 80 percent of businesses that don’t survive by efficiently managing the dissolution process for owners. Traditional expectations of business owners to pass down their companies beyond generations are insufficient to deal with the impending demand of millions of business owners seeking retirement over the next decade. While the private business wealth transfer is well over trillions of dollars, numerous startups are adding value for selling owners and prospective buyers that are cheaper and more efficient than a traditional broker and go beyond a standard classified ad posting. The business wealth transfer space has never been more exciting, yet it needs serious investment in new infrastructure to scale and improve the investor experience. For entrepreneurs who’ve also spotted this opportunity, now is an opportune time to build category-defining companies. At F-Prime, we have been partnering with the builders of fintech infrastructure for more than 50 years, including early investments in Alibaba, Flywire, Toast, Quove/Plaid, Vestwell, and FutureAdvisor/BlackRock. We could not be more excited by the opportunity we see in business ownership transfer, and the chance to partner with the founders who will define this category. Here, we’ve outlined one view of how this industry is shaping up.

Title: Nvidia earnings live updates: Wall Street watching chip demand and guidance around DeepSeek

Nvidia did it again. The AI chipmaker reported its earnings for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' revenue expectations with year-over-year growth of 78%. The results were highly anticipated by Wall Street as questions swirled about potential softening demand for Nvidia's high-end chips following Chinese AI company DeepSeek's lower-cost AI model, which burst onto the scene and sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. But the chipmaker stuck the landing, reporting $39.33 billion in revenue for the quarter compared to estimates of $38.25 billion. Nvidia also beat Wall Street analysts' "whisper number" — the unofficial reach target some analysts hope to see. According to Synovus's Dan Morgan, that target was $39 billion in total revenue for Nvidia's fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.89, compared to expectations of $0.84. In its key data center segment, Nvidia reported revenue of $35.6 billion compared to estimates of $34.06 billion. The company also gave upbeat guidance for the current quarter, telling investors it expects $43 billion in first-quarter revenue compared to expectations of $41.78 billion. However, Nvidia's gross margin is under pressure as it ramps up production of its Blackwell GPU, and Wall Street analysts asked multiple questions on the earnings call about Nvidia's guidance and any potential impact from President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown" and she expects gross margin to improve later in the year. Nvidia's stock saw volatile after-hours trading immediately following the earnings release, dipping as much as 2% before leveling out as Nvidia's CFO said demand for Blackwell "exceeded" expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Blackwell demand "extraordinary" and said the company anticipated the transition to the next-generation Blackwell Ultra to go smoother after a "hiccup" in early Blackwell production. The CEO also shouted out DeepSeek, saying the Chinese AI model had "ignited global enthusiasm." "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he told analysts. Nvidia stock was down 2.2% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, lagging the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. You can catch up on the highlights from Nvidia's earnings call with investors below. "DeepSeek R1 has ignited global enthusiasm," he says. "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he adds. Nvidia will talk more about Blackwell Ultra and Rubin at the company's GTC AI developer conference, which kicks off on March 17. Nvidia's stock price dipped into the red as the analyst call concluded. Wall Street has clearly zeroed in on Nvidia's gross margin pressure amid Blackwell's production ramp and the question of potential tariff impact. CFO Kress says gross margins are "quite complex in terms of the material." She says once Blackwell ramping is complete, the company can work on improving its margins. Speaking about tariffs and their potential impact, Kress says the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown." "It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is," Kress says. Kress says the company will "always follow export controls and or tariffs." Nvidia's CEO says older generation models are still being used today, thanks in part to the company's CUDA infrastructure. Older chips are great for less intensive workloads, he says. Referencing Nvidia's guidance, "China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters," Huang says. "It's about half of what it was before the export control, but it's approximately the same percentage with respect to with respect to geographies." AI chips are best thought of as software, he adds — everywhere and in every country. "Every student will have used AI as a tutor," Nvidia's CEO says. "No fintech company will not use AI," he adds, rattling off more examples of what he envisions for AI's growth across all industries. "Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed," Huang says. He says other factors go into making a business decision. Huang says there are a lot of reasons Nvidia does well and continues to generate strong demand, including the chipmaker's "ability to deploy is lighting fast" and create more advanced technology. Huang talks about the "hiccup" that happened during Nvidia's early production of Blackwell "that probably cost us a couple months." The company recovered "at the speed of light," he added and learned from the experience ahead of production of Blackwell Ultra. He says the "next train" is on an "annual rhythm." "We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out, they have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everyone to do the proper transition," he adds. "This was a very challenging transition," Huang says of Blackwell, but he expects the eventual transition to Blackwell Ultra to go smoother. He says the transition to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother because the chip architecture is the same. He says it was a lot more challenging to go from Hopper to Blackwell than it will be to go from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra. Ramping up production of a new product is expensive, and CFO Kress says the focus is on meeting demand. She reiterates that the company expects gross margins to increase to the mid-70s percent in the future. Blackwell is going to be "incredible across the board," Huang said. We haven't heard from CEO Jensen Huang yet. When Blackwell is fully ramped, Kress says there will be the opportunity to raise Nvidia's gross margin to the mid-70s percent later this fiscal year. Nvidia's gross margin expectations are currently in the low-70s percent. Kress says that revenue level is prior to any change in regulations and said China shipments are expected to stay "roughly at the current percentage." The CFO says data center revenue was strongest in the US due to Blackwell's ramp. Wall Street may be reacting to the CFO's comments that Blackwell's demand is strong. "The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI o3, DeepSeek R1, and Grok 3," Kress says. Blackwell sales "exceeded" expectations, Kress says. Blackwell production is in "full gear," she adds, calling it the company's fastest ramp ever for a product. Nvidia executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, are making their opening remarks. "Investments from hyperscalers demonstrate sustained demand for Nvidia's hardware," EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI. "Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides." Bourne added that Nvidia secured its position at the top by generating "billions" in Blackwell sales. While short-term market volatility is still to be expected, Nvidia "remains unmatched," he added. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock gained 2.3% to $129.54 heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. The stock was up as much as 6% in morning trades, hitting an intraday high of $133.73. As of Wednesday afternoon, the options market is pricing in an implied move of about 10% in either direction. Analysts at Mizuho said that while they expect Nvidia to report an "in-line" earnings report, they also expect some "growing pains." "Our checks indicate that while JanQ DC is expected in-line, AprilQ could be more flattish as near-term ramps remain modest given GB200 power/cooling requirements," Mizuho said in a note last week. DC refers to Nvidia's data center revenue, which encompasses its GPU chip sales. For Mizuho, the focus is on the second half of the year, as it expects a "strong" Blackwell ramp to make up for any lost revenues in the first half of the year. "We continue to see NVDA driving strong industry leadership with its CUDA ecosystem, on top of its integrated HW platform where it has strong customer relationships," Mizuho said, adding that it expects key customers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to turbocharger their Blackwell GPU purchases later this year. Mizuho rates Nvidia at "Outperform" with a $175 price target. Analysts at Wedbush said the big question going into earnings is whether it will be another "$2 billion beat and $2 billion raise" quarter. The firm thinks they can pull it off. "We expect another robust performance and 'clear beat and raise special' from Nvidia that should calm the nerves of investors as Jensen lays out the massive demand drivers from Blackwell and AI Capex in the field fueling this 4th Industrial Revolution," Wedbush said. Wedbush said that based on its channel checks, a single AI enterprise deployment has not slowed or changed because of DeepSeek. "No customer wants to 'lose their place in line' as it is described to us for Nvidia's next gen chips," Wedbush said. Analysts at Bank of America expect Nvidia to beat earnings estimates and said they see the company's calendar year 2025 data center revenue surging 60% year-over-year. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed "revolutionary" optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note earlier this month. Arya said that optimizations in hardware and software are "key parts of computing," so he doesn't expect DeepSeek efficiencies to lead to a reduction in sales for the company. Looking past earnings, Arya said Nvidia's GTC conference in March is the next big catalyst. That's where the investor focus for Nvidia could shift away from Blackwell and toward its next-generation products, including the Rubin GPU and solutions for autonomous robots. Bank of America rates Nvidia at a "Buy" with a $190 price target. Nvidia is likely to meet fourth-quarter revenue expectations and raise its first-quarter guidance "amid a significant ramp-up in its Blackwell GPUs," Kunjan Sobhani, tech analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Sobhani said Nvidia has overcome some recent supply-chain delays and concerns about hyperscaler demand, as evidenced by its stock price fully recovering the DeepSeek losses. "Initial shipments to key customers began in 4Q and will increase through 1Q26," Sobhani said. "Increased capital-spending guidance from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google aids our confidence in near-term sales." Encouragingly, Sobhani said Nivida's profit margins could "return to the mid-70s" in the second half of the year after declining due to the Blackwell production ramp. 4th quarter Data center revenue estimate: $34.06 billion 1st quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

U.S. stocks erased early gains on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia’s highly anticipated earnings report. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up 0.2% and 0.01%. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial index shed 0.4%. Data released in the morning showed sales of new single-family homes in January 2025 were recorded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 657,000, missing the consensus for 680,000 and down 10.5% from December’s upwardly revised 734,000. Here are stocks to watch today: AppLovin (APP+1.17%), the top-performing technology stock of 2024, plunged in New York trading on Wednesday after two short-seller reports that questioned the integrity of its AI-driven AXON advertising software. Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research both issued reports that claimed the company, which offers marketing services to app developers, had misrepresented the advantages of its AI platform and was misleadingly “force-feeding” app installations to users’ phones to inflate revenue. Axon (AXON-0.38%) stock surged after the weapons and surveillance technology company reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and issued upbeat full-year guidance. Axon posted adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, topping the analysts’ average of $1.40. Revenue climbed to $575.1 million from $544.3 million a year earlier. Intuit (INTU+1.39%) stock rose sharply following a strong earnings report and mixed guidance for the current period. The tax preparation and accounting software provider posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.32 for its fiscal second quarter, well above the estimated $2.57. Revenue reached $4 billion, surpassing expectations of $3.8 billion. NRG (NRG-0.98%) Energy stock jumped after the power utility holding company posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66% stock gained as the AI chip powerhouse prepares to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company. Salesforce (CRM-0.05%), a leading customer relationship management technology provider, rose ahead of its earnings report, scheduled for release after the market closes. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock surged after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year. Tesla (TSLA+3.07%) shares gave up early gains on Wednesday, extending their recent decline The company’s market capitalization has dropped below $1 trillion.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock surged more than 16% Wednesday morning after the AI hardware maker filed its long-awaited financial reports, alleviating delisting concerns on the Nasdaq that had loomed since last year. The San Jose-based company filed its delayed annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, along with quarterly earnings for the periods ending Sept. 30 and Dec. 31, after the market closed on Tuesday. “Today’s filings represent an important milestone,” said CEO Charles Liang. He added that the company is heavily investing in talent and processes across key departments to drive its mission in DLC, Data Center Building Block Solution (Supermicro 4.0), and revenue goals. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+1.66%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro’s stock has been on the rise, especially following its latest earnings report filed earlier this month. The report showcased a strong outlook and an ambitious 2026 target, drawing investor interest. Currently, the stock is trading around $53 per share, marking a 76% gain this year. The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. However, Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence.

That department is one of many now hit by mass layoffs and cuts led by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The Post spoke to unnamed sources from inside the government to back up its story. Almost two-thirds of the cash came in the past five years, according to the report. Just last year, at least $6.3 billion was committed to Musk’s companies. They included cash to build a Tesla factory and NASA contracts to his company SpaceX to aid the moon program. ALSO READ: Elon Musk's DOGE boys think this is a video game as Trump plots his 2nd coup “The total amount is probably larger: This analysis includes only publicly available contracts , omitting classified defense and intelligence work for the federal government,” the Post reported. It went on, “The Post found nearly a dozen other local grants, reimbursements and tax credits where the specific amount of money is not public.” The report also found 52 contracts with seven government agencies that are set to pay another $111.8 billion over the next few years. All seven agencies have come under DOGE's microscope. While Musk is not a paid government employee, he was a massive funder of now-President Donald Trump’s election campaign and is now a central part of his advisory team. He also heads DOGE, which he claims will slash trillions of dollars in government waste. Musks’s part in the Trump administration has raised many red flags among onlookers about major conflicts of interest. “Not every entrepreneur at this scale has been this dependent on federal money — certainly not Nvidia, not Microsoft, nor Amazon, nor Meta,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. A new report from Rolling Stone claims that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is taking a wrecking ball to the Social Security Administration, which could seriously hurt beneficiaries' ability to collect the money they are owed. According to the report, DOGE has already "shuttered at least 10 Social Security field offices in as many states" and "has eliminated the SSA’s Office of Transformation, a department whose work included making it easier for Americans to apply for and access benefits online — the exact service many people will need now that offices are being closed across ...

Many SNAP recipients are already required to work, especially those who are able bodied and under the age of 54. “If you are age 16 to 54 and able to work, you will probably need to meet the general work requirements to get SNAP benefits,” according to the SNAP website. “The general work requirements include registering for work, participating in SNAP Employment and Training or workfare if assigned by your state SNAP agency, taking a suitable job if offered, and not voluntarily quitting a job or reducing your work hours below 30 a week without a good reason.” President Donald Trump's interference with the Veterans Health Administration is having real and dire consequences, despite the administration's claims to the contrary, Sen.

Mountain View By Adam Nichols, Amid Elon Musk’s whirlwind campaign to cut thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in government services in the name of efficiency, a bombshell report Wednesday revealed a staggering amount of taxpayer cash that goes directly to him. The richest man in the world is one of the biggest earners paid from public money, the Washington Post found . A deep dive into government contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits found the South African billionaire has reaped $38 billion dollars of government cash. Want more breaking political news?

Title: Starmer: “Selling Britain by the Pound”

Time Published: 2025-02-26T14:33:38Z
Full Content:
In 1973, the rock band Genesis titled their album ‘Selling England by the Pound’. They did so for various reasons. The phrase was taken from a Labour Party slogan of the time, reflecting the album’s critique of Britain’s changing identity and economic challenges in the early 1970s. The title symbolised the loss of traditional English culture due to ‘Americanisation’, such as increasing commercialism, consumerism and materialism. It also referred to the UK’s economic struggles, including inflation, industrial disputes and debates about joining the European Economic Community. And the title used a pun on ‘pound’ as both currency and weight, emphasising the commercialisation of British identity. Much has changed in the 52 years since that album was released. There is not much left of Britain to sell after decades of neoliberal globalisation. It has been a long journey since Thatcher’s privatisation-deindustrialisation-deregulation agenda of the 1980s. Successive governments have continued to push through that agenda, and Kier Starmer, current prime minister and handmaiden to elite interests, is no different. Image: Keir Starmer at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, 19 January. Congress Centre – Congress Hall. (Copyright: World Economic Forum / Benedikt von Loebell / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) In 2023, prior to coming to power, Kier Starmer attended the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual get-together in Davos. While there, with BlackRock in attendance, he declared that Britain was open for business. In a 2023 BBC interview, Starmer stated that he preferred Davos to parliament, explaining his preference by saying that Westminster is “too constrained” and “closed,” describing it as a “tribal shouting place”. Starmer said that at Davos he can “engage with people that you can see working with in the future”. Starmer prefers to engage with unaccountable, unelected global elites — the Davos crowd — rather than domestic parliamentary processes. At Davos, he stated that energy independence required an “active state”. But this does not mean nationalisation or public ownership. It involves using public money and leveraging the machinery of state to facilitate the needs of private capital. Starmer has a habit of saying all the things global capital wants to hear. In late 2024, Starmer posted on X: “I’m determined to deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people’s pockets. This can only be achieved by working in partnership with leading businesses, like BlackRock, to capitalize on the UK’s position as a world-leading hub for investment.” Starmer met with Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, and expressed enthusiasm about partnering with the company. Furthermore, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated in a letter that Labour looks forward to working with BlackRock to “change the face of our UK”. And how will the face of “our” UK be changed? Image: Official portrait of Claudia Webbe MP (Licensed under CC BY 3.0) In December 2024, writing in the UK’s Morning Star newspaper, Claudia Webbe, former Member of Parliament, noted that BlackRock’s $10 trillion portfolio is more than the GDP of every country in the world except for the US and China. In her piece, she quotes Labour Member of Parliament Clive Lewis’s response to Starmer’s meeting with BlackRock. Lewis stated that instead of explaining how — 40 years of atomising, neoliberal plunder, the selling-off of and destruction of public services, the undermining of democracy, the hollowing out and selling off of natural resources at the hands of companies like BlackRock and other price-gouging corporations, billionaires and financial institutions — has led us to this point, the Labour Party has become the defender of elite interests. Webbe notes that BlackRock regards the future of the UK in terms of further cuts to welfare, more austerity and the further driving-down of wages, pensions and social security benefits. She adds that Starmer’s gushing about the government’s “partnership” with BlackRock may have been the trigger for wider public awareness and anger, but it was only the tip that gives away the iceberg of mass privatisation and intensified austerity that the Labour government is planning. BlackRock is a publicly owned investment manager that primarily provides its services to institutional, intermediary and rich individual investors. The firm exists to put its assets to work to make money for its clients. And it must ensure the financial system functions to secure this goal. And this is exactly what it does (see Black Rock’s War on Humanity here). Take food and agriculture, for instance. Many farmers and rural communities are worried about the potential threat of large asset management firms buying up agricultural land, especially following the British government’s proposed changes to inheritance tax on farms, set to take effect in April 2026. The new policy will impose a 20% inheritance tax on farms valued at more than £1 million, where they were previously exempt. The concern is that family farms in particular will be forced to sell up and get out of farming. This would certainly suit financial investors that regard farmland as a lucrative asset class. In the last couple of decades, farmland has become a tradable commodity (see The Commodification of Farmland here). Agricultural commodity traders are speculating on farmland through their own private equity subsidiaries, while new financial derivatives are allowing speculators to accrue land parcels and lease them back to struggling farmers, driving steep and sustained land price inflation. The financialisation of farmland accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. Professor John Bellamy Foster, writing in 2010, stated: “Lacking an outlet in production, capital took refuge in speculation in debt-leveraged finance (a bewildering array of options, futures, derivatives, swaps etc.).” The neoliberal agenda was the political expression of capital’s response to stagnation. With the engine of capital accumulation via production no longer firing on all cylinders, the emergency backup of financial expansion took over. Bellamy says we have seen a shift from real capital formation in many Western economies, which increases overall economic output, towards the appreciation of financial assets, which increases wealth claims but not output. Farmland is being transformed from a resource that supports food production and rural stability to a financial asset and speculative commodity (once farmland is bought up, think of its role in the so-called BlackRock-driven ‘green transition’ — solar panels and wind farms throughout the countryside). An asset class where wealthy investors can park their capital to further profit from inflated land prices. Aside from profiting from war, death and destruction, BlackRock is also heavily invested in the success of the prevailing globalised system of food and agriculture and profits from an inherently predatory food regime that is responsible for a cascade of environmental, social and health catastrophes, including poor-quality food and widespread illness. . Environmental activists, including global interfaith organization GreenFaith and Extinction Rebellion, protest BlackRock’s shareholder meeting on May 31, 2022. (Licensed under CC BY 2.0) . But why should Larry Fink care about this? Poor health is good for business. Scroll through BlackRock’s website and it soon becomes clear that it sees the healthcare sector as a strong long-term bet. Morality or conscience doesn’t come into it. Ordinary people are regarded as collateral damage or as digits on a computer screen to be rinsed for profit or plundered for gain. Hard-nosed billionaire and businessman Larry Fink, with the help of facilitator-in-chief Starmer, sees a golden opportunity to further hollow out Britain for the benefit of global finance. The criticism that Keir Starmer lacks vision is too kind. His vision, if we can call it that, seems to be selling Britain by the pound — a metaphorical fire sale of remaining national assets and potential while struggling to articulate a compelling narrative for the future to ordinary people. Starmer’s leadership is more about managing decline than charting a new course, despite his talk of making Britain a global leader in AI, an area in which the US and China are already well ahead. After years of Conservative austerity and Brexit turmoil, Britain now has another unpopular prime minister who seems content to peddle its future piece by piece. When Starmer stated that he is determined to “deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people’s pockets”, do you think he was actually referring to ordinary people? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Open-Access Networks Explained: A New Way to Get Home Internet

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities across the US, but they don’t operate like typical internet service providers. It's not Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. Locating local internet providers An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Locating local internet providers Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Mountain View By Rex Huppke, USA TODAY, Dear MAGA voters: President Donald Trump thanks you for your service, but he has determined you are now expendable. Please enjoy your Denny’s omelet surcharge and keep buying MAGA merchandise and Trump family cryptocurrency! If Trump was capable of honesty, that’s the note his supporters would be getting. It would be better than the “So long, suckers” message the president is sending via his administration’s priorities and reckless actions. Outside of some draconian actions on immigration and transgender rights , the kind of cruelty he promised his base, consider where we’re at since Trump has taken office. An unelected billionaire – Elon Musk – is ripping though the federal government like he owns the place, firing workers right and left, including thousands of veterans while the Republican Congress just watches. Trump has been musing about taking over Gaza and Greenland and the Panama Canal and Canada while siding with Russia and alienating America’s strongest allies in Europe. His scattershot tariffs have created economic uncertainty, rattling the stock market and leading to economic reports like this, from Reuters: “The Conference Board said consumer confidence deteriorated in February at its fastest pace in three-and-a-half years, with estimates for 12-month domestic inflation surging amid worries that U.S. tariffs on imports would raise prices for households.” Opinion: Musk email requires federal employees to list 5 things they did last week. Allow me. On Tuesday, the head of Alcoa, a Pittsburgh-based aluminum company, said Trump’s tariffs on aluminum imports could result in 100,000 job losses in the industry. CEO William Oplinger said: “It’s bad for American workers.” I’m sorry, but I was told electing Trump would be good for American workers. In fact, I was told specifically that food prices would swiftly go down and that the country would waltz into a new Golden Age . Well, it’s looking increasingly like that was – GASP! – a lie, and once Trump won the election and was able to do away with his myriad legal issues, he immediately abandoned the “ forgotten men and women ” he so sincerely promised to champion and went straight to helping himself and his fellow billionaires. Your Turn: Trump shows how many Americans are racist. Even when they don't think they are. | Opinion Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts summed it up on the House floor Tuesday while speaking out about a GOP budget that will, among other things, gut the Medicaid program many Trump voters rely on: “We all saw this coming. ... Last month, Trump’s inauguration, who was in the front row? It wasn't people on Medicaid. It wasn't factory workers. It wasn't nurses or teachers or firefighters. It wasn't even his own Cabinet. It was the richest people in the world.” For any forgotten men and women of America, that should have been a red flag. Trump had won on the backs of Americans who bought into his dishonest populist message. And since he got what he wanted, since he saved his own hide, the people who matter are clearly the ones with money. So in comes Musk, deemed brilliant by virtue of wealth. His smug talk of “wokeness” and diversity, equity and inclusion might trigger the pleasure centers of MAGA supporters. But they’re learning Musk’s ax is swinging for necks that include their own. Consider what Fox News’ Jesse Watters , a Trump toady if there ever was one, said after realizing that a friend of his – “a guy I met at a shooting event in New Jersey” – who is a 20-year military veteran about to get laid off from the Pentagon by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE: “He texted me and he said, ’Jesse, you know, this isn't good. I’m upset. This is really sad.’ And this guy is not a DEI consultant. This guy is not a climate consultant. This guy is a veteran. So when you’re talking about DOGE-ing people, veterans should get priority. Because if you’re going to go out there and kill enemies, put your life on the line for this country, you shouldn't be in the same category as people that are doing DEI.” Previously on Fox News, Watters had squawked excitedly about the DOGE firings , saying things like “DOGE is dishing out spankings like ‘Daddy Daycare’ ”; “There was a huge exodus over at the National Archives, persnickety librarians were getting DOGE’d silly”; and “DOGE is a blessing from the heavens above.” You see how that works? It’s all good when it somehow relates to Watters’ definition of “others,” but not when it involves someone he knows – one of those “real Americans,” I suppose. And of course he overlooks the fact that veterans have long been considered a part of the “diversity” in DEI . As the tens of thousands of federal layoffs continue , Trump voters are going to feel the impact more acutely in their own communities and social circles. We’re talking about an enormous number of people about to be out of work, and there will be veterans and MAGA supporters among them, cast off from their jobs and forced to reckon with food prices that haven’t gone down and federal services – like Medicaid – that may well dry up.

And assuredly, he’ll still do his best to fleece the diehards with dodgy crypto investments and any other thing he can slap his name on and sell. But for all intents and purposes, he’s done with you all. He cares only about the billionaires who line his Cabinet and his own personal fortune.

Title: NASDAQ files for Grayscale’s Polkadot ETF – Is DOT’s public trading debut near?

Time Published: 2025-02-26T13:15:56Z
Full Content:
Grayscale’s single-asset focus diverges from BlackRock and Fidelity’s diversified index-based crypto approaches. Grayscale has officially submitted a Form 19b-4 filing with NASDAQ to launch the Grayscale Polkadot Trust. It is expanding its crypto investment offerings for institutional investors to gain exposure to the Polkadot [DOT] ecosystem. This application follows Grayscale’s expansion into altcoin ETFs, with similar filings for Solana [SOL], Litecoin [LTC], XRP, Dogecoin [DOGE], and Cardano [ADA]. The filing is now subject to review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has 45 days to decide whether to approve, deny, or extend its evaluation. If approved, the ETF would offer institutional and retail investors a regulated means of gaining exposure to Polkadot without directly purchasing or storing DOT tokens. Market reactions to the filing have been swift, with analysts and industry commentators debating its significance. On X (formerly Twitter), reactions have varied. A crypto market observer described the filing as “huge” for institutional liquidity and predicted it could expand Polkadot’s market reach. However, not everyone shared this enthusiasm. Source: X A user questioned the role of institutional capital in crypto, humorously suggesting that it felt like – “Someone’s trying to steal my lunch money.” Polkadot’s price has responded positively, despite broader market turbulence. As of 26th of February, DOT was trading at $4.74, a 0.90% increase over the last 24 hours. In contrast, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced sharp declines, with BTC down 6.25% and ETH losing 6.05% in the same period. Source: CoinMarketCap Polkadot’s ability to hold steady while other assets experience losses suggests growing investor confidence, potentially fueled by the ETF speculation. Over the past week, DOT has been on a rollercoaster ride. It peaked at $5.30 on 21st of February before plummeting to a support level of $4.22 by 25th of February. The subsequent rebound aligns closely with buzz surrounding Grayscale’s ETF filing. Trading volume surged to $492.94 million, hinting at heightened interest and the possibility of an approval-fueled rally. Still, caution remains as investors await the SEC’s decision. Quite recently, the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s Spot Cardano ETF filing, signaling growing regulatory interest in single-asset altcoin ETFs. While this acknowledgment is not an outright approval, it marks a critical first step. Grayscale’s strategy diverges from that of more traditional asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity, who typically pursue diversified index-style products. Instead, Grayscale concentrates on single-asset trusts, allowing investors targeted exposure to specific cryptocurrencies without the complexities of direct asset custody. Polkadot, much like Solana and Litecoin, benefits from both decentralization and an active developer ecosystem, factors that enhance its appeal to institutional investors. Bloomberg analysts, including Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, have long tracked regulatory sentiment toward altcoin ETFs. Their assessments give Litecoin a 90% approval probability, Dogecoin 75%, Solana 70%, and XRP 65%. Source: X Polkadot and Hedera still carry an uncertain “maybe” status, indicating that the SEC’s stance on these assets is less clear. The coming weeks will be a litmus test not just for Polkadot’s ETF proposal, but also for the broader trajectory of altcoin ETFs in the United States. For investors and analysts, all eyes are on the regulators. If Polkadot’s ETF application follows in Cardano’s footsteps of formal acknowledgment—and possibly, approval—it could shift the market’s focus toward altcoin-specific products.

Melly Barajas is known as the “queen of tequila.” The 60-year-old founder and head distiller of Leyenda de Mexico was an aspiring fashion designer when her father planted the idea of owning a tequila brand in her head. As she started learning everything she could about making tequila, she was often the only woman in the room. In the 25 years since Leyenda’s founding as one of the first female-owned tequila companies, it has expanded to produce 20,000 liters of tequila daily. Barajas, who was recently named to the Forbes 50 Over 50: Global list, runs an all-female operation. “I really think this industry needed the female touch,” she told Forbes’ Maria Gracia Santillana Linares. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images The House approved a budget resolution Tuesday that lays the framework for President Donald Trump's agenda, the first major test of the new Congress. The plan calls for $2 trillion in overall spending cuts over the next decade, extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boosts defense spending. Trump told reporters Tuesday his administration plans to sell a “gold card” for $5 million that will provide wealthy non-citizens U.S. residency and a route to citizenship, an announcement that comes as he spearheads a mass deportation initiative. He said the card will give buyers the same privileges as green card holders, who have permanent residency and work authorizations in the U.S. Sean Gallup/Getty Images Tesla’s share price fell more than 8% Tuesday following reports that the company’s sales across Europe dropped by about 45% over the last month—despite rival electric-vehicle companies seeing increased demand. The losses caused CEO Elon Musk’s net worth to plummet by almost $15 billion, as his role in the Trump Administration weighs on shares, according to one analyst. Investors are eagerly awaiting Nvidia’s Wednesday’s earnings report, which will provide early indications of how it will emerge following the release of the less tech-intensive DeepSeek AI model from China. Ahead of the report, the AI giant’s stock fell 2.8% Tuesday, amid a broader pullback of tech stocks. At least 21 former staffers of the U.S. Digital Service, which was renamed the Department of Government Efficiency in a takeover by President Donald Trump, resigned Tuesday. The anonymous staffers wrote in a letter that they would not “use our skills as technologists” to “compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.” Donald Trump Jr. made $813,000 in 2024 as a director of Trump Media & Technology Group—roughly a quarter of the company’s annual revenue—despite attending just two of the board’s five meetings, according to an SEC filing. Trump Jr. controls 52% of the outstanding shares of the parent company of Truth Social, as the sole trustee of his father’s revocable trust. AFP/Getty Images Ukraine reportedly agreed Tuesday to partner with the U.S. on a mineral development deal, possibly mending a contentious relationship between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as Trump seeks a ceasefire with Russia. The deal involves Ukraine and the U.S. jointly developing Ukrainian minerals, oil and gas, according to Bloomberg, which noted the agreement does not include security guarantees for Ukraine. A growing coalition of Republicans are starting to speak out against DOGE and its mass layoffs across the federal workforce, including Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, and Georgia Rep. Richard McCormick. Several Republicans have been confronted by constituents about DOGE at recent town halls, though President Donald Trump has insisted Americans “like the job that Elon is doing.” MORE: White House officials confirmed that Amy Gleason, a longtime healthcare technology executive, is now the acting administrator of DOGE, following weeks of speculation over whether Elon Musk was officially in charge. Gleason previously worked in the U.S. Digital Service during Trump’s first term. BondIt cofounders Matthew Helderman and Luke Taylor TOPLINE For decades, taking big swings on ambitious independent film projects has been a seductive and highly risky investment strategy in Hollywood. Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony will celebrate the best of these success stories, but each year there are many more fortunes lost than trophies won. BondIt has differentiated itself since its founding in 2013 by lowering the risk, attracting institutional money and providing more dependable returns with its low stakes, high volume approach on movies that will never score millions at the box office or contend for Oscars. The company does have one nomination, but the vast majority of the 500-plus films BondIt has financed are the types of low-budget genre flicks that skip theatres and go straight to streaming services and TV networks across the world. The company builds its loans against predictable, projectable returns, such as the money a production receives back in tax credits for filming in a certain state or country, or its pre-sales in international markets. Other factors are less black-and-white, like a filmmakers’ ability to deliver a movie on time, the quality of the project’s sales team and how much equity capital has already been raised. BondIt movies might be less glamorous, but they deliver consistent returns. In any given 12-month window, BondIt invests in 50 or more films and turns over more than $100 million in capital—a metric the company measures as its revenue—writing off less than 1% in bad loans and delivering 15-20% returns. WHY IT MATTERS “In a time where movie studios and streamers are contracting and looking to cut costs, it would seem like there's a place in the entertainment industry for more independents to break through,” says Forbes reporter Matt Craig. “The only problem—independent movies are historically a very risky business. If BondIt can prove otherwise, it may be able to attract big institutional money to the space, and fund the kinds of movies that the studios no longer make.” MORE Why Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television Starbucks has had its ups and downs, but lately, it’s been mostly downs, as the company reported basically flat 2024 revenues and announced 1,100 corporate job cuts Monday. The company’s brand reputation is also declining, data shows: 4%: Starbucks’ decline in comparable store sales in the first quarter of 2025 No. 45: The coffee chain’s ranking in a recent Brand Finance report of the most valuable global brands, plunging from No. 15 in 2024 57.7: The number of points Starbucks’ reputation had on a 100-point index, declining from 71.5 points in 2021, according to Reptrak If you’re networking but still not landing job offers, that could be because you’re not meeting with the right people. While it’s important to network with employees at all levels, be sure to focus on the gatekeepers who influence or make hiring decisions. Smart networking is also a numbers game: Companies aren’t always hiring, so try to keep in touch with hiring managers and you’ll be top of mind when an opportunity opens up. A consumer activist group is launching a grassroots campaign to boycott online and in-store spending Friday in an attempt to “take back control of our economy, government and future of our country.” It’s also planning specific protests against which of the following retailers? A. Nestlé B. Amazon C. Walmart D. All of the above Check your answer. Thanks for reading! This edition of Forbes Daily was edited by Sarah Whitmire and Chris Dobstaff.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The crypto market is looking to regain some poise after yesterday's tumble with on-chain indicators showing signs of capitulation in bitcoin. Some tokens, like MakerDAO's MKR, stand out with a 20% gain in 24 hours, thanks to the DAO's buyback and burn process. IP, the native token of decentralized intellectual property-focused blockchain Story Protocol, is also in the green, having risen nearly 40%. The token's price has doubled in two weeks after being listed on South Korean exchanges. Other notable outperformers include Celestia's TIA along with XDC, QNT and HYPE. Data tracked by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain shows whales have been buying the dip in the HYPE token. XRP, meanwhile, is hanging on to a key Fibonacci level, keeping bulls' hope for bigger gains alive. According to Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, the crypto market is digesting the end of the recent memecoin frenzy, which could be replaced by productive sectors such as stablecoins, real-world assets and DeFi. "But until they start making their presence felt, the loss of energy will create a drag on the market," Hougan said on X. On the macroeconomic front, the optimism seen after the Nov. 4 election is being replaced by caution, as evidenced by Tuesday's release of the U.S. consumer confidence. The gauge dropped to an eight-month low, and the one-year inflation expectations were highest for 1.5 years, with President Donald Trump's tariffs singled out as the primary concern in almost every household and business survey. The dour sentiment and a strengthening yen might keep the upside in risk assets restricted for some time. Earlier this week, Belgium's central bank's head, Pierre Wunsch, warned that the ECB risks sleep-walking into too many rate cuts. The Fed, for its part, is unlikely to do QE anytime soon. (Sure, the January meeting minutes discussed an end of quantitive tightening, but that does not mean quantitative easing.) Speaking of key events to watch out for, the Senate Banking Committee, led by Senator Cynthia Lummis, is set to revisit crypto regulations during Wednesday's scheduled hearing titled “Exploring Bipartisan Legislative Frameworks for Digital Assets."

Selected in April 2024 for the $32 million contract, Rocket Lab is collaborating with Space Safari and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to develop and operate a spacecraft with rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) capabilities. The mission will be executed using Rocket Lab's vertically integrated Pioneer spacecraft, which will be launched aboard an Electron rocket from Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand. VICTUS HAZE is designed to showcase responsive space capabilities, demonstrating the ability to achieve launch readiness within 24 hours, track and approach target objects, and assess on-orbit threats. Rocket Lab's comprehensive approach integrates spacecraft manufacturing, launch execution, and mission operations to provide rapid-response solutions for national security. The completion of CDR confirms that the spacecraft's design, assembly, integration, testing, and operational strategies align with the mission's stringent requirements and constraints. "The ability to build a spacecraft, launch it, and operate it all in-house, on a tactically responsive timeline, is incredibly rare, but with our extensive launch heritage and deep vertical integration across space systems, we're ideally suited to make this mission a success," said Brad Clevenger, President and CEO of Rocket Lab National Security. "VICTUS HAZE solidifies Rocket Lab as a trusted and highly capable, end-to-end space company that can enable complex missions to serve the needs of the nation." With the successful CDR, the program now moves into the production phase, which will focus on spacecraft and launch vehicle integration, as well as preparing ground systems in anticipation of launch later this year.

Title: 21 federal technology staffers resign rather than help Elon Musk and DOGE slash size of US government

Wednesday, 26 Feb 2025 A demonstrator holds a poster displaying a prohibited traffic sign reading 'Musk DOGE' during a rally to protest President Trump's policies on Presidents Day on Feb 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. — AP WASHINGTON: More than 20 civil service employees resigned on Feb 25 from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services”. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honour those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk – not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government's ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernise Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE's government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday in masse. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardise Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,“ they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimise DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer – an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,“ Kamens said. US Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalised. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the US Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to improve services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. – AP Thank you for your report!

Title: NVIDIA Insiders Sell $1.6 Billion Of Stock, Buy Nothing A Year Ahead Of Today’s Earnings

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. With NVIDIA due to report another highly crucial earnings results later today, data shows that insiders have sold as much as $1.6 billion in stock over the year heading into the results. Investor hype surrounding NVIDIA's shares and its ability to drive the AI revolution has meant that the stock become the most valuable in the world multiple times ahead of last month's DeepSeek selloff. However, since then, NVIDIA's shares have failed to regain their lost glory as investors remain on the sideline to gauge demand for its products before buying more stock. Since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT, NVIDIA's shares have been on a tear and have been among the top performers on Wall Street. Since November 2022, they have gained 678% and led to many of the firm's employees becoming millionaires. The richest NVIDIA employee is CEO and founder Jensen Huang who owns 3.5% of the shares of the company that he set up in 1993. Huang is the 13th richest person in the world and is currently worth $113 billion. NVIDIA, on the other hand, is worth $3.1 trillion and is the second most valuable company in the world. Ahead of it is Cupertino, California, consumer technology giant Apple Inc, which leads by $600 billion on the market capitalization pyramid and is worth $4.7 trillion. However, NVIDIA sat at the top of the pyramid in January before the DeepSeek selloff recalibrated the stock market. Its shares lost 17% during the day, and while they have gained 6.9% since the DeepSeek bottom, the stock is yet to reach its previous highs. The firm's upcoming earnings report is expected to set the tone for its GPU demand and Blackwell availability for the rest of the year. So far, the consensus among investors is that Blackwell deliveries have been pushed into the second half of the year. NVIDIA's shares reflect the unease, as they have lost 9.62% in the days heading into the earnings. NVIDIA insiders also appear to have sold billions of dollars of stock over the year heading into the earnings. As per data shared on X, they have sold $1.6 billion of stock heading into earnings. Some notable sales include those by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and chief financial officer Collette Kress. For instance, Huang sold $8.62 million of shares in mid-December when the stock was trading at $135 while Kress cumulatively unloaded $18.62 million worth of shares on the same day. Another notable insider that has sold the stock is NVIDIA's field operations lead Ajay Puri who has sold more than $40 million worth of shares. NVIDIA's less-than-stellar share price performance ahead of the earnings has made the stock quite cheap, according to investment advisory Evercore ISI. In a fresh investment note, the firm kept a $190 share price target and an Overweight rating on the shares as it shared that with a 30x forward-price-to-earnings multiple, NVIDIA's shares were the cheapest in its AI coverage universe. BREAKING: In the last year, Nvidia, $NVDA, insiders have only sold. They have sold up to $1,602,674,927.72 in stock. There have been zero buys. pic.twitter.com/W9wLfEAiu0 — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) February 26, 2025 Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Title: Apple to invest $500 billion, create 20,000 US jobs; joins Meta, SoftBank in $1 trillion push

Apple Inc. became the latest company in the list of tech giants who have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in US investments, which President Donald Trump claims credit for. The iPhone maker said that it will spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years, hire 20,000 new employees and produce AI serves domestically. An hour after Apple's announcement, Donald Trump said that the company was spending in the US because it has “faith in what we are doing.” However, Apple didn’t directly attribute its investments to the Trump administration. According to Bloomberg, the plan itself isn’t far off from what Apple had previously said it would spend. Since Trump came to the White House as the President eight years ago, corporate pledges have seen taking shape. Now, corporates are revisiting this tradition as the Republican returns to the Oval Office for a second time. Around the start of Trump’s first term eight years ago, Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group Corp. made a commitment to invest $50 billion in the US that, it said, would create 50,000 jobs. Foxconn Technology Group and Intel Corp. were among others that handed Trump spending plans to tout — despite the fact that some were clearly in the works long before he took office. Here are some of the major tech investments announced since Donald Trump returned as the US President: Announced: $500 billion domestically over the next four years Previously: Apple was already expected to spend $10.8 billion on capital expenditures this year. Its operating expenses totaled $57.5 billion in 2024. Jobs: 20,000 Location: Houston and Detroit On Monday, Apple announced what the company described as its biggest US commitment to date. The tech giant is planning to hire 20,000 new workers, produce AI servers in the US and altogether spend $500 billion domestically over the next four years. Investments will include the opening of a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, a supplier academy in Michigan and additional spending with its existing suppliers in the country. The announcement came days after Trump and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook met, after which Trump suggested that Cook planned to invest “hundreds of billions of dollars.” Announced: As much as $500 billion Previously: Stargate is a new JV, but OpenAI had been pitching a plan for a massive data center build-out in the US for months, initially to the Biden administration Jobs: “Hundreds of thousands” Location: Texas, initially On Jan. 21 — the day after Trump was inaugurated — ChatGPT developer OpenAI, SoftBank and software giant Oracle Corp., announced a joint venture to develop AI infrastructure across the US. The firms said they plan to invest as much as $500 billion over the next four years — but are focused on a $100 billion deployment initially — on projects that they estimated would create “hundreds of thousands of American jobs.” Stargate’s first project is a data center complex that spans about 875 acres in Abilene, Texas, that will eventually be used to power AI systems. The joint venture marketed the project as a means of supporting the “reindustrialization of the United States” and protecting “the national security of America and its allies.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had been pitching the Biden administration on a massive AI infrastructure build-out last year. Announced: $100 billion Previously: SoftBank had been laying out plans for months to invest further in AI semiconductors, data centers and robots. Its Vision Fund invested $500 million in the leading US AI startup OpenAI and launched a $1.5 billion tender to buy more stock from OpenAI employees last year. Jobs: 100,000 Location: Texas, for one, through Stargate JV In December, Trump announced that SoftBank planned to invest $100 billion in the US over the next four years during an event alongside CEO Masayoshi Son. The plan includes a pledge to create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure, including investments in data centers, semiconductors and energy, according to a person familiar with the plan. The announcement immediately prompted the question of where the company will get the capital for its latest pledge. During Trump’s last term, Son was raising his $100 billion Vision Fund with money from outside investors and poured the cash into startups such as WeWork, Uber Technologies Inc. and DoorDash Inc. SoftBank doesn’t have the cash on hand to deliver on Son’s pledge this time. Announced: $65 billion Previously: Meta’s capital spending was expected to total nearly $60 billion this year. Its operating expenses topped $64 billion last year. Jobs: N/A Location: Louisiana, for one Meta Platforms Inc. plans to invest as much as $65 billion on projects related to artificial intelligence in 2025, including building a data center “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a Facebook post on Jan. 24. Meta plans to bring around a gigawatt of computing power online in 2025 and is projected to end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, the kind of chips critical to running AI systems, Zuckerberg said. He also said the company will “significantly” expand its AI teams, without quantifying the number of jobs to be created. Meta was already heavily investing in AI. Less than three months earlier, Zuckerberg had warned investors that Meta planned to “significantly accelerate” its capital spending in 2025 to bet on AI and the metaverse. The company had announced a $10 billion data center in Louisiana. Announced: Reiterated plans to invest more than $40 billion on US data centers Previously: All plans had already been announced Jobs: Estimated that AI will broadly help create the next “billion AI-enabled jobs” Location: States including Texas and Arizona Microsoft has yet to hand Trump a flashy announcement that he can take credit for. But its president, Brad Smith, did write a blog post in January to welcome Trump into the White House — and lay out investments it had already been planning. Among the plans he mentioned: Microsoft is on track to invest about $80 billion to build data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications, with more than half of that investment located in the US. Last year, the company announced that it would invest more than $35 billion in 14 countries within three years to build “secure” AI and data center infrastructure. The company has previously disclosed plans to build data center capacity in states including Arizona and Texas. It’s also working with BlackRock Inc. and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX investment vehicle to create an international investment fund to add up to $100 billion of additional funding for AI infrastructure and the AI supply chain. Announced: At least $20 billion Previously: Damac had already been laying the groundwork for a larger foray into the data centers business. Edgnex Data Centers, a unit of the Dubai-based conglomerate, had plans to invest $3 billion over the next three to five years in data centers in Southeast Asia. Jobs: “Thousands” Location: Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana Since Trump was first elected in 2016, Hussain Sajwani, the head of Damac Group, wanted the world to know he was the US president’s man in the Middle East. The real estate billionaire thrust himself into the spotlight again in January, standing alongside Trump and promising an investment of at least $20 billion to build new US data centers from Arizona to Ohio. The details of how Sajwani — whose net worth has surged in recent years to about $13 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — will finance such an undertaking weren’t immediately apparent. Sajwani, who is likely to lean heavily on banks and other financial institutions for much of that investment, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that Damac’s balance sheet would allow it to fund about 30%. Trump said the first phase of Damac’s plan would span Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana. Damac has said the investment is expected to create “thousands of jobs” where the data centers are built. Announced: $11 billion Previously: Amazon had laid out plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on new data centers long before Trump was elected. The company was already expected to drop nearly $100 billion on capital expenditures this year and had $243 billion in operating expenses last year. Jobs: At least 550 Location: Georgia In January, Amazon Web Services pledged to invest an estimated $11 billion in Georgia to expand infrastructure to support AI and cloud technologies. The investment is expected to create at least 550 new high-skilled jobs, according to the company’s press release. As part of the investment plan, the company will build new data centers in Butts County, Russ Crumbley, chairman of the Butts County board of commissioners, said in the statement. Announced: Nearly $1 billion Previously: Anduril had already said in August 2024 that it was planning to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on a new facility. Jobs: 4,000 directly, and another 8,500 to sustain operations Location: Ohio Defense tech startup Anduril Industries Inc. announced in January that it had chosen Ohio as the location of a sprawling new manufacturing facility that will produce tens of thousands of autonomous systems and weapons annually. Co-founder Palmer Luckey had previously said he expected the California-based weapons technology startup to thrive under the Trump administration. Anduril aims to secure final approvals to begin modernizing an existing facility on-site in coming weeks, and expects to begin producing weapons by July 2026. Anduril expects to invest nearly $1 billion in the new facility, which it says will create 4,000 jobs directly, and another 8,500 jobs to sustain operations. The startup had been planning the new facility long before Trump was elected. In August 2024, after raising $1.5 billion in a new funding round, the company said it planned to spend hundreds of millions on the new site.

Title: Tuesday’s Tech Stock Tank: Super Micro, Tesla, Advanced Micro, Intel

Tech stocks The buy the dip crowd failed to make an appearance Tuesday and the tech stocks they’ve been pumping up suffered the damage. Some of the big names tanked lower and could not find the usual support. At some point the Wall Street algorithms will find the courage to move back in, but it wasn’t today. First, for an overall look at the entire sector, here’s the daily price chart for the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund: Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund daily price chart, 2 25 25. This exchange traded fund has 69 holdings that include hardware, software, semiconductor names among other types of technology stocks. The chart shows four straight sessions of selling with the last two below the 50-day moving average. The early January low of near $225 may be a likely support area. Super Micro Computer (NASD: SMCI) Super Micro Computer daily price chart, 2 25 25. The computer hardware maker looked promising again with the mid-February blast up to above $65 but that is now called into question. The stock’s slide since then has taken it back below the 200-day moving average. The fact that the 50-day moving average appears to be turning up is worth following. Super Micro has a market cap of $26.67 billion. Tesla (NASD: TSLA) Tesla daily price chart, 2 25 25. The drop of 8.39% comes with big volume. The price is nearing the level of the up trending 200-day moving average. The early November gap up may be a target for traders. The same thing goes for the late October gap up. Note how the 50-day moving average is turning downward. This price chart has the look of a head and shoulders pattern, not typically a good sign. Tesla’s market cap is $973 billion. Advanced Micro Devices (NASD: AMD) Advanced Micro Devices daily price chart, 2 25 25 The semiconductor stock dropped to a new low on Tuesday. The 50-day moving average in early August had crossed below the 200-day moving average and has remained below it since then. Advance Micro Devices has a market cap of $168 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 103. The new low and the unrelenting slide must be a disappointment to those who purchased the stock as an “AI” name. Intel (NASD: INTC) Intel daily price chart, 2 25 25. The semiconductor maker took off higher in mid-February and it looked like it might fill the huge early August 2024 gap down. Those hopes faded with Tuesday’s -5.27% slide back below the 200-day moving average. This is the second close below it. Intel’s market cap is $99.55 billion. The company pays a .50% dividend. This is another name involved in the AI craze but without great stock performance over the past few months. Stats courtesy of FinViz.com. Charts courtesy of Stockcharts.com.

February 25, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Edison International (NYSE:EIX), Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC), Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) Class Period: February 25, 2021 - February 6, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Edison's claim that Southern California Edison Company ("SCE") used its Public Safety Power Shutoffs ("PSPS") program to "proactively de-energize power lines to mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires during extreme weather events", was false; (2) this resulted in heightened fire risk in California and heightened legal exposure to the Company; and (3) as a result, Defendants' statements about Edison's business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Edison class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/EIX Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) Class Period: May 31, 2024 - August 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Elastic had implemented significant changes to its sales operations, particularly with respect to its customer segments in the Americas; (2) the foregoing changes were likely to, and did, disrupt Elastic's sales operations during the first quarter of its FY 2025; (3) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the stability of Elastic's sales operations; (4) as a result of all the foregoing, Elastic was unlikely to meet its own previously issued revenue guidance for its FY 2025; and (5) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Elastic class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ESTC Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - January 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Intellia's Phase 1/2 study evaluating NTLA-3001 for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated lung disease. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s timeline for the aforementioned study, specifically that Intellia expected to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024. Defendants failed to disclose inter alia that the demand for viral-based editing was rapidly dwindling as non-viral delivery methods became a main target of the scientific research community due to their cost-effectiveness and more efficient development, thus making NTLA-3001 an inefficient program for Intellia to maintain. The alleged truth emerged on January 9, 2025, when Intellia published a press release announcing Company reorganization. In pertinent part, defendants disclosed that Intellia would be halting all NTLA-3001 research and studies and that the Company would be reducing its workforce by 27% in 2025. Specifically, the Company announced that management decided to focus Intellia’s resources on other pharmaceutical development and would be implementing cost saving in the form of a major reduction in force. As a result, defendants pipeline priority readjustment resulted in the Company’s once-touted NTLA-3001’s discontinuation. Following this news, Intellia’s stock price fell from a closing market price of $12.02 per share on January 8, 2025 to $10.20 per share on January 10, 2025. For more information on the Intellia class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NTLA Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) Class Period: February 3, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

Title: Off-brand weight-loss drug makers are suing the FDA, again
URL: https://qz.com/ofa-fda-compounded-semaglutide-lawsuit-1851766464
Time Published: 2025-02-25T22:43:12Z
Full Content:
A group that represents pharmacies that have been producing off-brand versions of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs just filed another lawsuit against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This time, it’s over the health regulator’s decision to remove semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.01%) popular Ozempic and Wegovy treatments — from its drug shortage list. Semaglutide has been on the agency’s shortage list since March 2022. During this time, pharmacies, telehealth companies, and other healthcare providers have been able to make and sell what are known as compounded versions of the drug. In its lawsuit, the Outsourcing Facility Association (OFA) claims that the agency is “dismissing evidence that the shortage persists” and that its decision will “deprive patients of a vital treatment.” Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1s, which have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY+0.84%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price have made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Due to branded drug shortages, companies have been able to sell off-brand versions. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. However, drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be commercially available. Compounding means a pharmacy or physician customizes an approved drug to fit an individual patient’s needs. The FDA also said on Friday that it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide in the next 60 to 90 days. This is the second lawsuit the OFA has filed against the FDA over compounded weight-loss drugs. Last October, the group sued the agency over its decision to remove tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Zepbound — from its shortage list, making arguments similar to those in its latest lawsuit. The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision. Then, in a letter from December, the agency stated that its review found that Eli Lilly had sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. This case is still ongoing. However, not all compounders are looking to challenge the FDA on this. “Compounding pharmacists have long known that this shortage had a shelf life,” said Scott Brunner, CEO of the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, in a statement. Brunner also thanked the FDA for providing compounders with an “off-ramp” to stop production — something the agency didn’t initially offer with its tirzepatide decision. The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Readers told us that maybe DOGE's email request is a good idea

Time Published: 2025-02-25T22:40:30Z

Katie Notopoulos, Senior Correspondent covering technology and culture On Monday, Business Insider asked readers what they'd do if they were suddenly asked to make a list of five things they accomplished at work last week — like DOGE asked federal workers to do. Nearly 120 readers responded, with a wide range of opinions. Only 18% of people said they wouldn't make the list at all. They'd accept that they might lose their job over their refusal. Some said they'd make the list, but begrudgingly. And nearly half of the people who replied said that not only would they willingly fill out the list of five accomplishments, but they'd do it with a smile and relish the chance to brag about their work. Clearly, the political tenor of the DOGE office and feelings about Elon Musk factored in. Quite a lot of the people who weren't his biggest fans had some colorful insults and invectives about the moonlighting Tesla CEO. "Stupidly childish and toxic" was one of the more safe-for-work critiques of DOGE's actions. Some people seemed excited by the idea that the "list five things" email could lead to cutting government waste. A recurring theme was that, while they didn't like the way DOGE was going about its work — which many said seemed insulting and threatening to workers — the idea of being expected to list out your weekly accomplishments is, indeed, a good idea. "I really don't hate it in theory as much as I distrust the people enacting this strategy," one reader wrote. Anthea Rowe, a communication coach who works with mid-career professionals, thought there was something good in the exercise. "We should all be prepared, at any time, to answer the question, 'What did you do last week?' And our answer shouldn't simply include a list of activities: 'I worked on search engine optimization for our website,'" Rowe wrote. "Instead, we should ideally report the outcomes we created last week: 'I increased visitors to the web pages of our priority products.'" (Rowe told me over email that she didn't endorse what DOGE is doing and that she's Canadian, so this isn't really her purview anyway.) Other people pointed out that a regular listing of duties and accomplishments is common for some in the private sector. Professionals such as lawyers or consultants who track billable hours for their clients are probably already doing this — as are some workers in industries like tech, where "stack ranking" for sorting people for layoffs is common. "I don't see what is wrong about your boss asking what did you do last week," one person said. "Federal employees are cuddled all their working career. They don't live in a real world where people get fired or laid off all the time. Why isn't the media acting the same way when Amazon or Microsoft laid off people this year? Wake up people, you need to work." Another also supported the request for an email list. "I submitted, and for 30+ years had my staff submit, a weekly activity report every Friday. It created high-performing organizations. Staff actually embraced it," the person said. "It was broadly viewed as management support and engagement. You never heard anyone say, 'My boss doesn't know what I do or doesn't help.' I cannot understand the resistance unless someone is trying to hide out somewhere." Chatting about this with coworkers, my boss' boss said she encourages people to keep a running "hype list" of their accomplishments so they can whip it out at review time. But, of course, that's under very different circumstances than what's happening right now with federal workers. As long-term career advice, keeping track of your accomplishments — in writing — and making sure your boss knows about them is probably a great thing. That's not what's happening at DOGE, where many workers find the gesture undermining and insulting instead of empowering. "Unfortunately, this isn't too different from what a lot of teachers are currently having to deal with," said Rachel Shearer, a middle school teacher. "We're constantly asked to show proof of what we are doing (both regarding our lessons and what we do outside our lessons, like contacting parents, documenting student behaviors). I think that this kind of micromanaging is extremely demoralizing and counterproductive; I do my best work when I know that I'm not constantly being watched and scrutinized." Ellen Predham, a former HR professional with more than 40 years of experience, said the issue was in the messaging. "I think the intent is fine, but the communication of this request was all wrong," she said. "Email should have come from Cabinet heads, not Musk, and definitely should not have said if you don't, you're resigning — a terrible way to communicate with folks." Still, if federal workers don't respond — and some departments have exempted their employees, even as Musk has extended the deadline — they could lose their jobs. Or at least that's the threat on the table. That's partly the point, one reader said. "How can a manager provide a meaningful performance review if they don't know what an employee is doing and their productivity?" asked the reader, a management consultant. "How would an organization determine sufficient staffing?" We might soon find out. Jump to

Title: Amid an Uncertain Year, Can Nvidia Soothe Wall Street’s Nerves?

Nvidia (NVDA) has had a bumpy start of 2025. Share price of the A.I. chip giant surged to record highs at the beginning of the year and then fell sharply in late January after the Chinese startup DeepSeek shook Silicon Valley. Now, analysts are eagerly anticipating Nvidia’s fourth-quarter and 2024 financial results, set to release tomorrow (Feb. 26), to gauge its actual position in the A.I. race. Nvidia is the world’s second most valuable public company with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion, meaning its earnings report could also have major implications for the broader stock market.

You can opt out anytime. Wall Street expects Nvidia’s quarterly revenue to soar 72 percent to $38 billion and profit to jump 64 percent to $19.6 billion. But to keep its share price on an upward trajectory, the company might have to do even better. To avoid a sell-off, Nvidia must meet its “normal exceed,” Ted Mortonson, managing director at Baird, told Fortune. While DeepSeek’s cost-efficient breakthrough initially led investors to believe demand for A.I. chips could fall, some analysts have pushed back on such fears. “We believe that A.I. GPU demand still exceeds supply, so while slimmer models may enable greater development for the same number of chips, we still think tech firms will continue to buy all the GPUs they can as part of this A.I. ‘gold rush,’” said Brian Colello, a Morningstar analyst, in a January note. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised DeepSeek in a recent interview for “making everybody take notice” of opportunities for more efficient A.I. models. While the initial market response suggested Wall Street was losing faith in compute investments, Huang claimed “it’s exactly the opposite,” given the “fairly compute-intensive” nature of reasoning-focused models like DeepSeek’s R1. But Nvidia stock took another hit on Feb. 21, falling 4 percent after the investment bank TD Cowen reported that Microsoft has cancelled leases for at least two data center operators. The news sparked concerns over a decline in demand for A.I. compute. “It points to a potential oversupply position,” said TD Cowen analysts in the report. In response, Microsoft noted that it is “well positioned” to meet increasing demand but may “strategically pace or adjust” its infrastructure in some areas. Nvidia’s earnings come amid a broader market downturn. Last week, major indexes saw their worst day this year so far in response to weaker-than-expected economic reports on the U.S. services sector and consumer sentiment. But when it comes to A.I., tech bulls are confident that Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will put an end to Wall Street’s caution. While the market is “heavily skewed negative right now around tech sentiment,” Nvidia’s upcoming performance should “calm the nerves of investors,” said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities in a client note. Updates on Nvidia’s new Blackwell chip and demand from Big Tech clients will continue to fuel optimism towards the technology, Ives added. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to spend more than $300 billion cumulatively this year on A.I. efforts, including buying Nvidia chips. “After speaking with many enterprise A.I. customers, we have not seen one A.I. enterprise slow down or change,” said Ives, who added that no clients want to “lose their place in line” for Nvidia’s next-gen chips. During Nvidia’s last earnings call in November, Huang noted that Blackwell production was “in full steam.” The success of Nvidia’s transition to its next-gen GPUs will be closely watched when the company reports earnings tomorrow. “All eyes will be on Blackwell commentary,” according to Hans Mosemann, an analyst with Rosenblatt who predicts that Huang will reaffirm that demand for shipments remains high throughout 2025. “We see shipments of Blackwell accelerating as we progress through the year, with a stronger [second half].” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Nvidia to report earnings amid infrastructure spending, DeepSeek concerns

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Nvidia is scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial results on Wednesday after the bell. It’s expected to put the finishing touches on one of the most remarkable years from a large company ever. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $38 billion in sales for the quarter ended in January, which would be a 72% increase on an annual basis. The January quarter will cap off the second fiscal year where Nvidia’s sales more than doubled. It’s a breathtaking streak driven by the fact that Nvidia’s data center graphics processing units, or GPUs, are essential hardware for building and deploying artificial intelligence services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In the past two years, Nvidia stock has risen 478%, making it the most valuable U.S. company at times with a market cap over $3 trillion. But Nvidia’s stock has slowed in recent months as investors question where the chip company can go from here. It’s trading at the same price as it did last October, and investors are wary of any signs that Nvidia’s most important customers might be tightening their belts after years of big capital expenditures. This is particularly concerning in the wake of recent breakthroughs in AI out of China. Much of Nvidia’s sales go to a handful of companies building massive server farms, usually to rent out to other companies. These cloud companies are typically called “hyperscalers.” Last February, Nvidia said a single customer accounted for 19% of its total revenue in fiscal 2024. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated this month that Microsoft will account for nearly 35% of spending in 2025 on Blackwell, Nvidia’s latest AI chip. Google is at 32.2%, Oracle at 7.4% and Amazon at 6.2%. This is why any sign that Microsoft or its rivals might pull back spending plans can shake Nvidia stock. Last week, TD Cowen analysts said that they’d learned that Microsoft had canceled leases with private data center operators, slowed its process of negotiating to enter into new leases and adjusted plans to spend on international data centers in favor of U.S. facilities. The report raised fears about the sustainability of AI infrastructure growth. That could mean less demand for Nvidia’s chips. TD Cowen’s Michael Elias said his team’s finding points to “a potential oversupply position” for Microsoft. Shares of Nvidia fell 4% on Friday. Microsoft pushed back Monday, saying it still planned to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in 2025. “While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions. This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future,” a spokesperson told CNBC. Over the last month, most of Nvidia’s key customers touted large investments. Alphabet is targeting $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, Meta will spend as much as $65 billion and Amazon is aiming to spend $100 billion. Analysts say about half of AI infrastructure capital expenditures ends up with Nvidia. Many hyperscalers dabble in AMD’s GPUs and are developing their own AI chips to lessen their dependence on Nvidia, but the company holds the majority of the market for cutting-edge AI chips. So far, these chips have been used primarily to train new age AI models, a process that can cost hundreds of millions dollars. After the AI is developed by companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, warehouses full of Nvidia GPUs are required to serve those models to customers. That’s why Nvidia projects its revenue to continue growing. Another challenge for Nvidia is last month’s emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which released an efficient and “distilled” AI model. It had high enough performance that suggested billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs aren’t needed to train and use cutting-edge AI. That temporarily sunk Nvidia’s stock, causing the company to lose almost $600 billion in market cap. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will have an opportunity on Wednesday to explain why AI will continue to need even more GPU capacity even after last year’s massive build-out. Recently, Huang has spoken about the “scaling law,” an observation from OpenAI in 2020 that AI models get better the more data and compute are used when creating them. Huang said that DeepSeek’s R1 model points to a new wrinkle in the scaling law that Nvidia calls “Test Time Scaling.” Huang has contended that the next major path to AI improvement is by applying more GPUs to the process of deploying AI, or inference. That allows chatbots to “reason,” or generate a lot of data in the process of thinking through a problem. AI models are trained only a few times to create and fine-tune them. But AI models can be called millions of times per month, so using more compute at inference will require more Nvidia chips deployed to customers. “The market responded to R1 as in, ‘oh my gosh, AI is finished,’ that AI doesn’t need to do any more computing anymore,” Huang said in a pretaped interview last week. “It’s exactly the opposite.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Federal Tech Staffers Resign Rather Than Help Musk and DOGE

WASHINGTON — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. Read More: White House Says Musk Part of Trump’s ‘Unified Team’ as Agencies Undermine Him The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists, designers and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation. “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years," Leavitt said. "President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.” Read More: How Trump's Attacks on DEI Are Hurting Communities That Voted for Him Musk posted on his social media site X that the story was “fake news” and suggested that the staffers were “Dem political holdovers" who “would have been fired had they not resigned.” The staffers who resigned had worked for the United States Digital Service, but said their duties were being integrated into DOGE. Their former office, the USDS, was established under President Barack Obama after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law. All previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Read More: Elon Musk Draws Ire Telling Federal Employees to Justify Their Jobs Over Email or Resign According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government's ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Roughly one-third of the 65 staffers who remained at USDS quit on Tuesday rather than take on new duties under DOGE. Read More: Everyone Who's Resigned From the Trump Administration in Protest "We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services," they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. "This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. "I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans," Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. Leavitt, the White House press secretary, is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on first- and fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Associated Press video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed from Boston.

A group of 21 US federal workers issued a resignation letter saying DOGE risked compromising sensitive government data. A group of civil service employees in the United States have announced their resignation from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in the latest sign of discord within the administration of President Donald Trump. The 21 employees issued a joint letter to DOGE leadership, which was also obtained by media outlets including The Associated Press. In their statement on Tuesday, they accused DOGE of carrying out ideological attacks and risking the integrity of government systems. “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the employees wrote. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The workers involved in the resignation included engineers, data scientists and product managers, all of whom were previously employed by top technology firms including Google and Amazon. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardise Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they explained. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimise DOGE’s actions.” The resignations are the latest fallout from Trump’s scorched-earth approach to downsizing and reshaping the federal workforce. Shortly after being elected to a second term in November, Trump tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee DOGE, a new panel whose purview was ambiguous. At first, it was not clear how DOGE would function: whether it would exist outside of government or within it, for example. Critics also pointed out that independent oversight agencies already existed to ensure government efficiency. But on his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order transforming the United States Digital Service — a preexisting office — into DOGE. The Digital Service was created in 2014 to address technology hurdles. Its formation had been prompted by the White House’s struggles to launch a medical insurance portal for Americans, as part of then-President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms. The employees who resigned on Tuesday were part of the Digital Service before it became DOGE. They warned that their office had been visited by individuals wearing White House visitors’ passes, who interrogated employees about their political leanings and work experience. They also denounced the layoffs that have been visited upon the DOGE staff. Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off — a drastic cut, according to Tuesday’s resignation letter. The letter-writers warned that such sudden, steep declines in the workforce would undermine the White House’s ability to handle technology-based projects. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Only about 65 employees remained in the office after the February layoffs — and most were assigned to participate in the government downsizing DOGE has overseen. A third of that remaining group resigned on Tuesday. With responsibilities ranging from national security to intelligence gathering, healthcare to education, the federal government is the largest employer in the US. More than two million employees work in some capacity for the federal government, with thousands more — including in industries like agriculture and technology — reliant on government contracts. But upon taking office, Trump has moved swiftly to slash the employee base, which he has accused of harbouring “Biden bureaucrats”, a reference to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Many civil service members, however, are nonpartisan and help ensure the smooth functioning of the government across different administrations. Trump and Musk have also attempted to shutter whole agencies, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which was established under an act of Congress. That has, in turn, queued up a legal battle over the powers of the presidency. The mass layoffs and buyout offers have also sparked legal challenges from unions, states and individual employees, who argue their rights are being trampled. Experts have warned that Musk and Trump’s approach could have particularly devastating effects for individual citizens, who could see data mix-ups affect their day-to-day lives, from Social Security payments to the potential for privacy breaches. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk,” Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the US Department of Transportation, told The Associated Press. “But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that.” Already, fractures have started to emerge within the Trump White House — and even between the president and Musk himself. On Saturday, Musk had announced on his social media platform X that federal employees had until Monday to respond to an email with a five-point list describing their work over the past week. Failure to comply, he warned, would be understood as a resignation. But the backlash was swift, with labour unions and politicians denouncing the move as illegal. Some government agencies even told their staff to ignore Musk’s demand. By Monday, the Office of Personnel Management had announced to all departments and agencies that they could overlook the request without fear for their jobs. Some Republican lawmakers have also openly questioned Musk’s slash-and-burn approach. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, for instance, has criticised Musk’s firings as irresponsible and disrespectful to long-time government employees. “This is not how we treat any of our workforce. It’s not how we treat our federal employees. They deserve better,” she said at a town hall event last week. “You do not treat people in this manner who have been good public servants.” Murkowski also slammed Musk’s request for an emailed summary of federal workers’ achievements. ‘“Our public workforce deserves to be treated with dignity and respect for the unheralded jobs they perform,” she wrote in a post on X. “The absurd weekend email to justify their existence wasn’t it.” But Musk on Tuesday appeared to double down on his threats on Monday. “Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,” Musk wrote on X. “Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Tiger Woods speaks alongside U.S. President Donald Trump during a reception honoring Black History Month in the East Room of the White House on February 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) It’s the last week of Black History Month, and celebrations have been markedly muted this year. The month-long commemoration was first recognized in 1976 when President Gerald Ford established Black History Month to celebrate African American history and achievements in the United States. It’s been observed every February since. But this year, Black History Month comes in the midst of a larger national pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Businesses have been rolling back DEI initiatives for the last year due to pressure from conservative investors. And the pace of such rollbacks has increased since President Donald Trump took office. A number of government agencies said they will no longer celebrate identity-based observances like Black History Month, Pride Month and Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and apps like Google Calendar have said they will no longer mark those observances across calendars. President Trump himself has signed a number of executive orders cutting back on DEI programming and funding, and has shifted employment policy at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to focus on “anti-American bias” instead of race or gender discrimination. That’s not to say the federal government has gone completely silent on Black History Month. Trump acknowledged the celebratory month in January, and hosted a reception honoring the occasion last week at the White House, despite his own executive orders rolling back DEI––parts of which a federal judge has blocked. And a number of businesses, like Apple and Costco, have doubled down on their commitment to protecting DEI programs. As Black History Month comes to an end and the U.S. continues its debate over DEI policies, support for Black history, businesses and employees should be year-round, writes contributor Julie Kratz.

This comes after the agency recalled workers who had taken the government’s deferred resignation program offer earlier in the year, stating that certain “critical filing season positions” were exempt. While employees are increasingly less confident about their employer’s business outlook, CEO confidence is on the rise. According to a new report by The Conference Board, CEO confidence has surged to a three-year high, thanks to a stronger economic climate. The survey does, however, point to growing concerns about how mass deportations could impact the labor force. Elon Musk isn’t the only billionaire to have come into the United States through an immigrant visa. Here are the billionaires who benefited from H1-B visas to launch their careers (and wealth) in the U.S. Tech companies, led by Amazon, were awarded the most H1-B visas last year. DOGE continues to cut jobs across the federal government. Employees at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, FEMA, TSA and even the Department of Defense were recently laid off. The massive government layoffs are starting to worry Wall Street analysts. One prominent economist called the DOGE-led cuts a “growing” risk to the American economy and markets, Derek Saul reports. But they’re also worrying the very people carrying them out. Twenty-one staffers resigned from DOGE on Tuesday, saying they wouldn’t use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services,” according to the AP. And despite all these cuts, the Trump Administration has continued to rehire federal staff in “critical” positions shortly after removing them from those same positions. This week, workers at the FDA were asked to come back after trade groups pushed back against cuts. Folks at the National Park Services and those working with bird flu at the Department of Agriculture were also reinstated.

Title: Hims & Hers can't sell off-brand Ozempic forever, but it can still sell these weight-loss meds

Hims & Hers (HIMS+5.66%) made a killing last year selling an off-brand version of Ozempic, but with the drug’s shortage now over, the company will soon have to halt sales of its cheaper alternative. That said, the millennial-focused telehealth company still has a few options on the table. Back in May, Hims & Hers started selling compounded semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s (NVO+1.01%) Ozempic and Wegovy — for just $199 a month. That’s a big difference compared to Ozempic’s $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag. Compounding means a pharmacy or physician customizes an approved drug to fit an individual patient’s needs. Hims & Hers could sell this off-brand version because of recent shortages of GLP-1 drugs. Normally, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits making drugs that are just copies of commercially available ones. However, when drugs are in shortage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t consider them commercially available. Now that the shortage is over, Hims & Hers will likely have to stop selling compounded semaglutide. The FDA updated its drug shortage list on Friday, marking the branded versions of semaglutide as fully available. The agency also said it will start citing companies and healthcare providers that continue to offer “essential copies” of compounded semaglutide in the next 60 to 90 days. Hims & Hers said it will stop offering these essential copies of semaglutide this year. “We will have to start notifying customers in the coming month or two that they will need to start looking for alternative options on the commercial dosing,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told investors during a call on Monday evening. Still, the company expects its weight-loss business to generate at least $725 million in 2025. Here are the weight-loss treatments Hims & Hers can still legally sell: The company already offers monthly subscription for popular GLP-1 diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. These drugs work by mimicking a gut hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppress appetite. Dudum also told investors that the company is open to a partnership like the one its rival Ro has with Eli Lilly, which lets Ro offer its members cheaper Zepbound in vials rather than the standard auto-injector pens. However, he added, that there is still issues with the limited supply for branded weight-loss drugs. “We still really can’t actually source the branded medications from our pharmacies for our own platform,” Dudum said. He said this prevents the company for having a “durable offering” of branded weight-loss drugs at scale. Hims & Hers also currently offers what it calls “oral medication kits” made up of medication and supplements that can aid in weight loss including bupropion, metformin, topiramate, vitamin B12, and naltrexone. The company will continue to offer personalized prescriptions of compounded semaglutide. Under the law, these prescriptions will need to be significantly different from branded medication on the market — differences can include personalized dosing or alternative administration methods. In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions. On Monday’s call, Hims & Hers CFO Oluyemi Okupe said that personalized semaglutide dosages will supplement the company’s core offerings. The company announced in November that it plans to offer customers a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight loss drug, this year. Liraglutide, is taken daily instead of weekly like newer options, and is currently sold under the brand name Saxenda by Novo Nordisk. Many of its patents have already expired. In a 56-week-long clinical trial, the once-daily injection helped most patients lose over 5% of their weight. For comparison, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s (LLY+0.84%) weekly-injectable Zepbound lost over 20% of their weight after 72 weeks during a clinical trial. Dudum said the company plans to launch its liraglutide offering by midyear or early in the second half of the year.

Title: Wall Street eyes 'growing pains' in Nvidia earnings but all eyes are on a bullish 2nd half for its next-gen chip

Nvidia did it again. The AI chipmaker reported its earnings for the fourth quarter after the closing bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' revenue expectations with year-over-year growth of 78%. The results were highly anticipated by Wall Street as questions swirled about potential softening demand for Nvidia's high-end chips following Chinese AI company DeepSeek's lower-cost AI model, which burst onto the scene and sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley. But the chipmaker stuck the landing, reporting $39.33 billion in revenue for the quarter compared to estimates of $38.25 billion. Nvidia also beat Wall Street analysts' "whisper number" — the unofficial reach target some analysts hope to see. According to Synovus's Dan Morgan, that target was $39 billion in total revenue for Nvidia's fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.89, compared to expectations of $0.84. In its key data center segment, Nvidia reported revenue of $35.6 billion compared to estimates of $34.06 billion. The company also gave upbeat guidance for the current quarter, telling investors it expects $43 billion in first-quarter revenue compared to expectations of $41.78 billion. However, Nvidia's gross margin is under pressure as it ramps up production of its Blackwell GPU, and Wall Street analysts asked multiple questions on the earnings call about Nvidia's guidance and any potential impact from President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown" and she expects gross margin to improve later in the year. Nvidia's stock saw volatile after-hours trading immediately following the earnings release, dipping as much as 2% before leveling out as Nvidia's CFO said demand for Blackwell "exceeded" expectations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Blackwell demand "extraordinary" and said the company anticipated the transition to the next-generation Blackwell Ultra to go smoother after a "hiccup" in early Blackwell production. The CEO also shouted out DeepSeek, saying the Chinese AI model had "ignited global enthusiasm." "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he told analysts. Nvidia stock was down 2.2% year-to-date through Wednesday's close, lagging the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. You can catch up on the highlights from Nvidia's earnings call with investors below. "DeepSeek R1 has ignited global enthusiasm," he says. "It's an excellent innovation, but even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model, or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques," he adds. Nvidia will talk more about Blackwell Ultra and Rubin at the company's GTC AI developer conference, which kicks off on March 17. Nvidia's stock price dipped into the red as the analyst call concluded. Wall Street has clearly zeroed in on Nvidia's gross margin pressure amid Blackwell's production ramp and the question of potential tariff impact. CFO Kress says gross margins are "quite complex in terms of the material." She says once Blackwell ramping is complete, the company can work on improving its margins. Speaking about tariffs and their potential impact, Kress says the timing and amount of tariffs are "a little bit of an unknown." "It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is," Kress says. Kress says the company will "always follow export controls and or tariffs." Nvidia's CEO says older generation models are still being used today, thanks in part to the company's CUDA infrastructure. Older chips are great for less intensive workloads, he says. Referencing Nvidia's guidance, "China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters," Huang says. "It's about half of what it was before the export control, but it's approximately the same percentage with respect to with respect to geographies." AI chips are best thought of as software, he adds — everywhere and in every country. "Every student will have used AI as a tutor," Nvidia's CEO says. "No fintech company will not use AI," he adds, rattling off more examples of what he envisions for AI's growth across all industries. "Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed," Huang says. He says other factors go into making a business decision. Huang says there are a lot of reasons Nvidia does well and continues to generate strong demand, including the chipmaker's "ability to deploy is lighting fast" and create more advanced technology. Huang talks about the "hiccup" that happened during Nvidia's early production of Blackwell "that probably cost us a couple months." The company recovered "at the speed of light," he added and learned from the experience ahead of production of Blackwell Ultra. He says the "next train" is on an "annual rhythm." "We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out, they have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everyone to do the proper transition," he adds. "This was a very challenging transition," Huang says of Blackwell, but he expects the eventual transition to Blackwell Ultra to go smoother. He says the transition to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother because the chip architecture is the same. He says it was a lot more challenging to go from Hopper to Blackwell than it will be to go from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra. Ramping up production of a new product is expensive, and CFO Kress says the focus is on meeting demand. She reiterates that the company expects gross margins to increase to the mid-70s percent in the future. Blackwell is going to be "incredible across the board," Huang said. We haven't heard from CEO Jensen Huang yet. When Blackwell is fully ramped, Kress says there will be the opportunity to raise Nvidia's gross margin to the mid-70s percent later this fiscal year. Nvidia's gross margin expectations are currently in the low-70s percent. Kress says that revenue level is prior to any change in regulations and said China shipments are expected to stay "roughly at the current percentage." The CFO says data center revenue was strongest in the US due to Blackwell's ramp. Wall Street may be reacting to the CFO's comments that Blackwell's demand is strong. "The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI o3, DeepSeek R1, and Grok 3," Kress says. Blackwell sales "exceeded" expectations, Kress says. Blackwell production is in "full gear," she adds, calling it the company's fastest ramp ever for a product. Nvidia executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, are making their opening remarks. "Investments from hyperscalers demonstrate sustained demand for Nvidia's hardware," EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI. "Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides." Bourne added that Nvidia secured its position at the top by generating "billions" in Blackwell sales. While short-term market volatility is still to be expected, Nvidia "remains unmatched," he added. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock gained 2.3% to $129.54 heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. The stock was up as much as 6% in morning trades, hitting an intraday high of $133.73. As of Wednesday afternoon, the options market is pricing in an implied move of about 10% in either direction. Analysts at Mizuho said that while they expect Nvidia to report an "in-line" earnings report, they also expect some "growing pains." "Our checks indicate that while JanQ DC is expected in-line, AprilQ could be more flattish as near-term ramps remain modest given GB200 power/cooling requirements," Mizuho said in a note last week. DC refers to Nvidia's data center revenue, which encompasses its GPU chip sales. For Mizuho, the focus is on the second half of the year, as it expects a "strong" Blackwell ramp to make up for any lost revenues in the first half of the year. "We continue to see NVDA driving strong industry leadership with its CUDA ecosystem, on top of its integrated HW platform where it has strong customer relationships," Mizuho said, adding that it expects key customers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to turbocharger their Blackwell GPU purchases later this year. Mizuho rates Nvidia at "Outperform" with a $175 price target. Analysts at Wedbush said the big question going into earnings is whether it will be another "$2 billion beat and $2 billion raise" quarter. The firm thinks they can pull it off. "We expect another robust performance and 'clear beat and raise special' from Nvidia that should calm the nerves of investors as Jensen lays out the massive demand drivers from Blackwell and AI Capex in the field fueling this 4th Industrial Revolution," Wedbush said. Wedbush said that based on its channel checks, a single AI enterprise deployment has not slowed or changed because of DeepSeek. "No customer wants to 'lose their place in line' as it is described to us for Nvidia's next gen chips," Wedbush said. Analysts at Bank of America expect Nvidia to beat earnings estimates and said they see the company's calendar year 2025 data center revenue surging 60% year-over-year. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed "revolutionary" optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note earlier this month. Arya said that optimizations in hardware and software are "key parts of computing," so he doesn't expect DeepSeek efficiencies to lead to a reduction in sales for the company. Looking past earnings, Arya said Nvidia's GTC conference in March is the next big catalyst. That's where the investor focus for Nvidia could shift away from Blackwell and toward its next-generation products, including the Rubin GPU and solutions for autonomous robots. Bank of America rates Nvidia at a "Buy" with a $190 price target. Nvidia is likely to meet fourth-quarter revenue expectations and raise its first-quarter guidance "amid a significant ramp-up in its Blackwell GPUs," Kunjan Sobhani, tech analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Sobhani said Nvidia has overcome some recent supply-chain delays and concerns about hyperscaler demand, as evidenced by its stock price fully recovering the DeepSeek losses. "Initial shipments to key customers began in 4Q and will increase through 1Q26," Sobhani said. "Increased capital-spending guidance from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google aids our confidence in near-term sales." Encouragingly, Sobhani said Nivida's profit margins could "return to the mid-70s" in the second half of the year after declining due to the Blackwell production ramp. 4th quarter Data center revenue estimate: $34.06 billion 1st quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Huang talks about the "hiccup" that happened during Nvidia's early production of Blackwell "that probably cost us a couple months." The company recovered "at the speed of light," he added and learned from the experience ahead of production of Blackwell Ultra. He says the "next train" is on an "annual rhythm." "We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out, they have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everyone to do the proper transition," he adds. "This was a very challenging transition," Huang says of Blackwell, but he expects the eventual transition to Blackwell Ultra to go smoother. He says the transition to Blackwell Ultra will be smoother because the chip architecture is the same. He says it was a lot more challenging to go from Hopper to Blackwell than it will be to go from Blackwell to Blackwell Ultra. Ramping up production of a new product is expensive, and CFO Kress says the focus is on meeting demand. She reiterates that the company expects gross margins to increase to the mid-70s percent in the future. Blackwell is going to be "incredible across the board," Huang said. We haven't heard from CEO Jensen Huang yet. When Blackwell is fully ramped, Kress says there will be the opportunity to raise Nvidia's gross margin to the mid-70s percent later this fiscal year. Nvidia's gross margin expectations are currently in the low-70s percent. Kress says that revenue level is prior to any change in regulations and said China shipments are expected to stay "roughly at the current percentage." The CFO says data center revenue was strongest in the US due to Blackwell's ramp. Wall Street may be reacting to the CFO's comments that Blackwell's demand is strong. "The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI o3, DeepSeek R1, and Grok 3," Kress says. Blackwell sales "exceeded" expectations, Kress says. Blackwell production is in "full gear," she adds, calling it the company's fastest ramp ever for a product. Nvidia executives, including CEO Jensen Huang, are making their opening remarks. "Investments from hyperscalers demonstrate sustained demand for Nvidia's hardware," EMARKETER analyst Jacob Bourne told BI. "Competitors are making strides but frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources that Nvidia provides." Bourne added that Nvidia secured its position at the top by generating "billions" in Blackwell sales. While short-term market volatility is still to be expected, Nvidia "remains unmatched," he added. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock gained 2.3% to $129.54 heading into its fourth quarter earnings report. The stock was up as much as 6% in morning trades, hitting an intraday high of $133.73. As of Wednesday afternoon, the options market is pricing in an implied move of about 10% in either direction. Analysts at Mizuho said that while they expect Nvidia to report an "in-line" earnings report, they also expect some "growing pains." "Our checks indicate that while JanQ DC is expected in-line, AprilQ could be more flattish as near-term ramps remain modest given GB200 power/cooling requirements," Mizuho said in a note last week. DC refers to Nvidia's data center revenue, which encompasses its GPU chip sales. For Mizuho, the focus is on the second half of the year, as it expects a "strong" Blackwell ramp to make up for any lost revenues in the first half of the year. "We continue to see NVDA driving strong industry leadership with its CUDA ecosystem, on top of its integrated HW platform where it has strong customer relationships," Mizuho said, adding that it expects key customers Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to turbocharger their Blackwell GPU purchases later this year. Mizuho rates Nvidia at "Outperform" with a $175 price target. Analysts at Wedbush said the big question going into earnings is whether it will be another "$2 billion beat and $2 billion raise" quarter. The firm thinks they can pull it off. "We expect another robust performance and 'clear beat and raise special' from Nvidia that should calm the nerves of investors as Jensen lays out the massive demand drivers from Blackwell and AI Capex in the field fueling this 4th Industrial Revolution," Wedbush said. Wedbush said that based on its channel checks, a single AI enterprise deployment has not slowed or changed because of DeepSeek. "No customer wants to 'lose their place in line' as it is described to us for Nvidia's next gen chips," Wedbush said. Analysts at Bank of America expect Nvidia to beat earnings estimates and said they see the company's calendar year 2025 data center revenue surging 60% year-over-year. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed "revolutionary" optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," Vivek Arya, an analyst at Bank of America, said in a note earlier this month. Arya said that optimizations in hardware and software are "key parts of computing," so he doesn't expect DeepSeek efficiencies to lead to a reduction in sales for the company. Looking past earnings, Arya said Nvidia's GTC conference in March is the next big catalyst. That's where the investor focus for Nvidia could shift away from Blackwell and toward its next-generation products, including the Rubin GPU and solutions for autonomous robots. Bank of America rates Nvidia at a "Buy" with a $190 price target. Nvidia is likely to meet fourth-quarter revenue expectations and raise its first-quarter guidance "amid a significant ramp-up in its Blackwell GPUs," Kunjan Sobhani, tech analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said last week. Sobhani said Nvidia has overcome some recent supply-chain delays and concerns about hyperscaler demand, as evidenced by its stock price fully recovering the DeepSeek losses. "Initial shipments to key customers began in 4Q and will increase through 1Q26," Sobhani said. "Increased capital-spending guidance from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services and Google aids our confidence in near-term sales." Encouragingly, Sobhani said Nivida's profit margins could "return to the mid-70s" in the second half of the year after declining due to the Blackwell production ramp. 4th quarter Data center revenue estimate: $34.06 billion 1st quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Mountain View By Byron Tau, Associated PressBrian Slodysko, Associated Press, WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” WATCH: Why a former IRS commissioner says Musk’s mass layoffs are a ‘huge mistake’ The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. READ MORE: Nearly 40 percent of contracts canceled by Musk’s DOGE are expected to produce no savings According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people. AP video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed from Boston. Tech billionaire and advisor to President Donald Trump, Elon Musk said that he “Will check with the President” on a $5,000 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dividend for every American taxpayer. CALIFORNIA – California attorney general Rob Bonta warned federal employees, February 3, about the Trump Administration’s “deferred resignation” program. The program purports to offer federal employees pay through September 30, 2025, if they resign by February 6, 2025. Just a couple of years ago, most of us did not know what "work from home" meant. Most of us packed our lunches, headed into the morning commute, grabbed a cup of coffee, and worked at a job site or desk all day long. Disclosure: State of Alabama-based writer.

Homeless people often are immersed in drugs and they aren’t getting the substance abuse treatment they need, an original investigation published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, shows. In President Joe Biden’s administration’s final days, we witnessed egregious and unprecedented abuses of the presidential pardon and commutation powers. These began with the pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, issued in early December — despite Biden’s earlier commitment not to do so — and culminated in a slew of preemptive pardons for family members and political allies disclosed only as Biden’s term expired.

Measles is a highly infectious, potentially deadly disease that is especially dangerous for children under 5 years old. Karen Huger might need to get Teresa Giudice on the phone for tips on surviving prison because that’s where the Real Housewives of Potomac star is headed. The Grande Dame was sentenced to two years for a DUI stemming from March 2024. On Sunday, thousands in Los Angeles stood in solidarity with the city’s immigrant community. Together, demonstrators of all ages protested Trump’s ongoing threats of mass deportations that would directly impact large groups of people in the city and surrounding L.A. County. A federal judge denied, on February 18, the request by a coalition of 14 states, including California, for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against tech billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Democratic Gov. Tony Evers unveiled his 2025-27 biennial budget proposal last week — a two-year plan totaling nearly $119 billion compared to the $100 billion budget currently on the books. In an announcement on the Senate floor on his 83rd birthday, Senator Mitch McConnell, the longest serving Senate leader in U.S. history, said he would not be seeking reelection for an eighth term at the end of his current term in 2026. CALIFORNIA – President Donald Trump remarked, February 4, that California’s High-Speed Rail is ‘the worst managed project’ and that he would soon be launching an investigation. Nataly Aguilar still shakes and hyperventilates when she recalls the night that an alcohol-fueled prom after-party, hosted at an off-duty LAPD officer's home in Santa Clarita, ended with the officer pointing a shotgun at her and threatening her life. President Trump has created an era of uncertainty for organizations serving people experiencing homelessness, according to advocacy groups for the unhoused. Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and the National Alliance to End Homelessness both issued statements this week about Trump’s recent actions. “In less than two weeks, the new federal administration has released dozens of executive orders impacting policies, organizations, and programs that have been serving our communities for decades,” according to an email from the Coalition. “As the largest provider for people experiencing homelessness in the state, the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and the people we serve are and will continue to be directly impacted by these far-reaching and drastic measures.” Sonya Stokes, an emergency room physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, braces herself for a daily deluge of patients sick with coughs, soreness, fevers, vomiting, and other flu-like symptoms. Homeless people often are immersed in drugs and they aren’t getting the substance abuse treatment they need, an original investigation published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, shows. Sandy Paws Rescue Inc., a dedicated foster-based rescue in Massachusetts, recently gave an update on Juney, a young dog in their care that has already been through so much in his short life. Sadly, Juney's early life was marred by severe trauma. Sandy Paws Rescue explains that he was beaten and brutally attacked with a machete, leaving him with a fractured jaw and significant damage to his mouth and nose. The cruelty he endured is almost unimaginable, yet Juney's spirit remained unbroken. When Sandy Paws Rescue Inc. learned of him, they knew they had to intervene and offer him a chance at a better life.

Global stocks were shaken on Tuesday after it was revealed US consumer confidence fell this month by the most since August 2021 on concerns about the outlook for the broader economy. Euronext Dublin outperformed international peers as it rose 0.5 per cent. Bank of Ireland’s stock price rose 2 per cent to above €11 as the market responded well to the start of its share buyback. AIB, meanwhile, was up 1 per cent at close of business. Elsewhere, Ryanair was unchanged amid a mixed bag for the airlines with EasyJet and International Airlines Group both down marginally. Among the food names, Kerry Group finished the day up 0.7 per cent, while Glanbia was unchanged. It was a good day too for agri-services group Origin Enterprises, which finished up 2.5 per cent. It was more of a struggle for the housebuilders, with Glenveagh Properties and Cairn Homes each down about 0.7 per cent by the end of trading. Britain’s FTSE 100 edged higher with defence stocks rising after prime minister Keir Starmer announced an increase in UK defence spending, while Unilever slipped after CEO Hein Schumacher’s surprise exit. The blue-chip FTSE 100 rose 0.1 per cent, ending a five-session losing streak but still traded near its lowest level in about three weeks. Defence group BAE Systems gained 4.7 per cent and Rolls-Royce climbed 1.4 per cent after Starmer said he would increase annual defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 and target a 3 per cent level last seen just after the end of the Cold War in 1989-90. Also buoying the FTSE 100 was a 6.1 per cent rise in Smith+Nephew after the medical products maker reported annual sales and profit broadly in-line with expectations. On the flip side, Unilever shed 1.3 per cent as the consumer goods group surprised investors by ousting chief executive Hein Schumacher and replacing him with finance chief Fernando Fernandez. The midcap FTSE 250 dipped 0.2 per cent, with CMC Markets dropping 6.2 per cent after the trading platform said finance chief Albert Soleiman would step down. Euro zone bond yields edged lower while markets weighed signs that Germany could approve a boost in defence spending before the outgoing parliament quits, a move likely to require more borrowing. Traders considered a report that Germany is discussing €200 billion for an emergency defence fund as the country digests its election result. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield – a benchmark for the wider euro area – was down one basis point at 2.457 per cent. Yields move inversely to prices. Italy’s 10-year yield was down 3 basis points at 3.531 per cent. The yield gap between Italian and German government bonds was 106.8 basis points. On the stock markets, the Cac 40 in Paris was down 0.49 per cent, while, in Frankfurt, the Dax moved 0.13 per cent lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led Wall Street declined, hitting a six-week low after fresh economic data indicated a deterioration in consumer sentiment and investors braced for the potential impact of tighter US trade curbs on Beijing. Chipmaker Nvidia dropped 2.9 per cent, while other semiconductor stocks also fell, with the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index down 1.6 per cent. Most megacap stocks traded lower, with Microsoft and Meta Platforms down 0.8 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, while Tesla led losses with a 5.6 per cent decline. Seven of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors traded lower, with technology stocks leading losses with a 1.4 per cent decline. Defensive sector consumer staples led gains with a 1.4 per cent rise. Eli Lilly rose 2.5 per cent after the drugmaker said it has begun selling higher doses of its weight-loss drug Zepbound in vials in the U.S., at a discount to the injector-pen versions. – Additional reporting: Agencies Colin Gleeson is an Irish Times reporter Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Brian Slodysko, Associated Press Brian Slodysko, Associated Press Byron Tau, Associated Press Byron Tau, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” WATCH: Why a former IRS commissioner says Musk’s mass layoffs are a ‘huge mistake’ The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. READ MORE: Nearly 40 percent of contracts canceled by Musk’s DOGE are expected to produce no savings According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people.

Title: AI Promise and Chip Precariousness

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: Yesterday Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 3.7; Dylan Patel had the joke of the day about Anthropic’s seeming aversion to the number “4”, which means “die” in Chinese: Anthropic is also a chinese ai company because of their aversion to the number four Jokes aside, the correction on this post by Ethan Mollick suggests that Anthropic did not increment the main version number because Sonnet 3.7 is still in the GPT-4 class of models as far as compute is concerned. After publishing this piece, I was contacted by Anthropic who told me that Sonnet 3.7 would not be considered a 10^26 FLOP model and cost a few tens of millions of dollars to train, though future models will be much bigger. I updated the post with that information. The only significant change is that Claude 3 is now referred to as an advanced model but not a Gen3 model. I love Mollick’s work, but reject his neutral naming scheme: whoever gets to a generation first deserves the honor of the name. In other words, if Gen2 models are GPT-4 class, then Gen3 models are Grok 3 class. And, whereas Sonnet 3.7 is an evolution of Sonnet 3.5’s fascinating mixture of personality and coding prowess, likely a result of some Anthropic special sauce in post-training, Grok 3 feels like a model that is the result of a step-order increase in compute capacity, with a much lighter layer of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Its answers are far more in-depth and detailed (model good!), but frequently becomes too verbose (RLHF lacking); it gets math problems right (model good!), but its explanations are harder to follow (RLHF lacking). It is also much more willing to generate forbidden content, from erotica to bomb recipes, while having on the surface the political sensibilities of Tumblr, with something more akin to 4chan under the surface if you prod.1 Grok 3, more than any model yet, feels like the distilled Internet; it’s my favorite so far. Grok 3 is also a reminder of how much speed matters, and, by extension, why base models are still important in a world of AI’s that reason. Grok 3 is tangibly faster than the competition, which is a better user experience; more generally, conversation is the realm of quick wits, not deep thinkers. The latter is who I want doing research or other agentic-type tasks; the former makes for a better consumer user experience in a chatbot or voice interface. ChatGPT, meanwhile, still has the best product experience — its Mac app in particular is dramatically better than Claude’s2 — and it handles more consumer-y use cases like math homework in a much more user-friendly way. Deep Research, meanwhile, is significantly better than all of its competitors (including Grok’s “Deep Search”), and, for me anyways, the closest experience yet to AGI. OpenAI’s biggest asset, however, is the ChatGPT brand and associated mindshare; COO Brad Lightcap just told CNBC that the service had surpassed 400 million weekly active users, a 33% increase in less than 3 months. OpenAI is, as I declared four months after the release of ChatGPT, the accidental consumer tech company. Consumer tech companies are the hardest to build and have the potential to be the most valuable; they also require a completely different culture and value chain than a research organization with an API on the side. That is the fundamental reality that I suspect has driven much of the OpenAI upheaval over the last two-and-a-half years: long-time OpenAI employees didn’t sign up to be the next Google Search or Meta, nor is Microsoft interested in being a mere component supplier to a company that must own the consumer relationship to succeed. In fact, though, OpenAI has moved too slowly: the company should absolutely have an ad-supported version by now, no matter how much the very idea might make AI researchers’ skin crawl; one of the takeaways from the DeepSeek phenomenon was how many consumers didn’t understand how good OpenAI’s best models were because they were not paying customers. It is very much in OpenAI’s competitive interest to make it cost-effective to give free users the best models, and that means advertising. More importantly, the only way for a consumer tech company to truly scale to the entire world is by having an ad model, which maximizes the addressable market while still making it possible to continually increase the average revenue per user (this doesn’t foreclose a subscription model of course; indeed, ads + subscriptions is the ultimate destination for a consumer content business). DeepSeek, meanwhile, has both been the biggest story of the year, in part because it is the yin to Grok 3’s yang. DeepSeek’s V3 and R1 models are excellent and worthy competitors in the GPT-4 class, and they achieved this excellence through extremely impressive engineering on both the infrastructure and model layers; Grok 3, on the other hand, simply bought the most top-of-the-line Nvidia chips, leveraging the company’s networking to build the biggest computing cluster yet, and came out with a model that is better, but not astronomically so. The fact that DeepSeek is Chinese is critically important, for reasons I will get to below, but it is just as important that it is an open lab, regularly publishing papers, full model weights, and underlying source code. DeepSeek’s models — which are both better than Meta’s Llama models and more open (and unencumbered by an “openish” license) — set the bar for “minimum open capability”; any model at or below DeepSeek’s models has no real excuse to not be open. Safety concerns are moot when you can just run DeepSeek, while competitive concerns are dwarfed by the sacrifice in uptake and interest entailed in having a model that is both worse and closed. Both DeepSeek and Llama, meanwhile, provide significant pressure on pricing; API costs in both the U.S. and China have come down in response to the Chinese research lab’s releases, and the only way to have a sustainable margin in the long run is to either have a cost advantage in infrastructure (i.e. Google), have a sustainable model capability advantage (potentially Claude and coding), or be an Aggregator (which is what OpenAI ought to pursue with ChatGPT). All of this is — but for those with high p-doom concerns — great news. AI at the moment seems to be a goldilocks position: there is sufficient incentive for the leading research labs to raise money and continue investing in new foundation models (in the hope of building an AI that improves itself), even as competition drives API prices down relentlessly, further incentivizing model makers to come up with differentiated products and capabilities. The biggest winner, of course, continues to be Nvidia, whose chips are fabbed by TSMC: DeepSeek’s success is causing Chinese demand for the H20, Nvidia’s reduced-compute-and-reduced-bandwidth-to-abide-by-export-controls version of the H200, to skyrocket, even as xAI just demonstrated that the fastest way to compete is to pay for the best chips. DeepSeek’s innovations will make other models more efficient, but it’s reasonable to argue that those efficiences are downstream from the chip ban, and that it’s understandable why companies who can just buy the best chips haven’t pursued — but will certainly borrow! — similar gains. That latter point is a problem for AMD in particular: SemiAnalysis published a brutal breakdown late last year demonstrating just how poor the Nvidia competitor’s software is relative to its hardware; AMD promises to do better, but, frankly, great chips limited by poor software has been the story of AMD for its entire five decades of existence. Some companies, like Meta or Microsoft, might put in the work to write better software, but leading labs don’t have the time nor expertise. The story is different for Huawei and its Ascend line of AI chips. Those chips are fabbed on China’s Semiconductor Manufactoring International Corporation’s (SMIC) 7nm process, using western-built deep ultraviolet lighography (DUV) and quad-patterning; that this is possible isn’t a surprise, but it’s reasonable to assume that the fab won’t progress further without a Chinese supplier developing extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) (and no, calling an evolution of the 7nm process 5.5nm doesn’t count). Still, the primary limitation for AI chips — particularly when it comes to inference — isn’t necessarily chip speed, but rather memory bandwidth, and that can be improved at the current process level. Moreover, one way to (somewhat) overcome the necessity of using less efficient chips is to simply build more data centers with more power, something that China is much better at than the U.S. Most importantly, however, is that China’s tech companies have the motivation — and the software chops — to make the Ascend a viable contender, particularly for inference. There is one more player who should be mentioned alongside Nvidia/TSMC and Huawei/SMIC, and that is the hyperscalers who design their own chips, either on their own (AWS with Trainium and Microsoft with Maia) or in collaboration with Broadcom (Google with TPUs and Meta with MTIA). The capabilities and importance of these efforts varies — Google has been investing in TPUs for a decade now, and trains its own models on them, while the next-generation Anthropic model is being trained on Trainium; Meta’s MTIA is about recommendations and not generative AI, while Microsoft’s Maia is a much more nascent effort — but what they all have in common is that their chips are fabbed by TSMC. That TSMC is dominant isn’t necessarily a surprise. Yes, much has been written, including on this site, about Intel’s stumbles and TSMC’s rise, but even if Intel had managed to stay on the leading edge — and 18A is looking promising — there is still the matter of the company needing to transform itself from an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) who designs and makes its own chips, to a foundry that has the customer service, IP library, and experience to make chips for 3rd parties like all of the entities I just discussed. Nvidia, to take a pertinent example, was making its chips at TSMC (and Samsung) even when Intel had the leading process; indeed, it was the creation of TSMC and its pure-play foundry model that even made Nvidia possible.3 This also means that TSMC doesn’t just have leading edge capacity, but trailing edge capacity as well. There are a lot of chips in the world — both on AI servers and also in everything from cars to stereos to refrigerators — that don’t need to be on the cutting edge and which benefit from the low costs afforded by the fully depreciated foundries TSMC still maintains, mostly in Taiwan. And TSMC, in turn, can take that cash flow — along with increasing prices for the leading edge — and invest in new fabs on the cutting edge. Those leading edge fabs continue to skyrocket in price, which means volume is critical. That is why it was clear to me back when this site started in 2013 that Intel needed to become a foundry; unfortunately the company didn’t follow my advice, preferring to see their stock price soar on the back of cloud server demand. Fast forward to 2021 and Intel — now no longer on the leading edge, and with its cloud server business bleeding share to a resurgent AMD on TSMC’s superior process — tried, under the leadership of Pat Gelsinger, to become a foundry; unfortunately the company’s diminishing cash position is larger than its foundry customer base, which is mostly experimental chips or x86 variants. Intel’s core problem goes back to the observation above: becoming a foundry is about more than having the leading edge process; Intel might have been able to develop those skills in conjunction with customers eager to be on the best process in the world, but once Intel didn’t even have that, it had nothing to offer. There simply is no reason for an Apple or AMD or Nvidia to take the massive risk entailed in working with Intel when TSMC is an option. TSMC is, of course, headquartered in Taiwan; that is where the company’s R&D and leading edge fabs are located, along with most of its trailing edge capacity. SMIC, obviously, is in China; another foundry is Samsung, in South Korea. I told the story as to why so much of this industry ended up in Asia last fall in A Chance to Build: Semiconductors are so integral to the history of Silicon Valley that they give the region its name, and, more importantly, its culture: chips require huge amounts of up-front investment, but they have, relative to most other manufactured goods, minimal marginal costs; this economic reality helped drive the development of the venture capital model, which provided unencumbered startup capital to companies who could earn theoretically unlimited returns at scale. This model worked even better with software, which was perfectly replicable. That history starts in 1956, when William Shockley founded the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to commercialize the transistor that he had helped invent at Bell Labs; he chose Mountain View to be close to his ailing mother. A year later the so-called “Traitorous Eight”, led by Robert Noyce, left and founded Fairchild Semiconductor down the road. Six years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened a facility in Hong Kong to assemble and test semiconductors. Assembly required manually attaching wires to a semiconductor chip, a labor-intensive and monotonous task that was difficult to do economically with American wages, which ran about $2.50/hour; Hong Kong wages were a tenth of that. Four years later Texas Instruments opened a facility in Taiwan, where wages were $0.19/hour; two years after that Fairchild Semiconductor opened another facility in Singapore, where wages were $0.11/hour. In other words, you can make the case that the classic story of Silicon Valley isn’t completely honest. Chips did have marginal costs, but that marginal cost was, within single digit years of the founding of Silicon Valley, exported to Asia. I recounted in that Article about how this outsourcing was an intentional policy of the U.S. government, and launched into a broader discussion about the post-War Pax Americana global order that placed the U.S. consumer market at the center of global trade, denominated by the dollar, and why that led to an inevitable decline in American manufacturing and the rise of a country in China that, in retrospect, was simply too big, and thus too expensive, for America to bear. That, anyways, is how one might frame many of the signals coming out of the 2nd Trump administration, including what appears to be a Monroe 2.0 Doctrine approach to North America, an attempt to extricate the U.S. from the Ukraine conflict specifically and Europe broadly, and, well, a perhaps tamer approach to China to start, at least compared to Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail. One possibility is that Trump is actually following through on the “pivot to Asia” that U.S. Presidents have been talking about but failing to execute on for years; in this view the U.S. is girding itself up to defend Taiwan and other entities in Asia, and hopefully break up the burgeoning China-Russia relationship in the process. The other explanation is more depressing, but perhaps more realistic: President Trump may believe that the unipolar U.S.-dominated world that has been the norm since the fall of the Soviet Union is drawing to a close, and it’s better for the U.S. to proactively shift to a new norm than to have it forced upon them. The important takeaway that is relevant to this Article is that Taiwan is the flashpoint in both scenarios. A pivot to Asia is about gearing up to defend Taiwan from a potential Chinese invasion or embargo; a retrenchment to the Americas is about potentially granting — or acknowledging — China as the hegemon of Asia, which would inevitably lead to Taiwan’s envelopment by China. This is, needless to say, a discussion where I tread gingerly, not least because I have lived in Taipei off and on for over two decades. And, of course, there is the moral component entailed in Taiwan being a vibrant democracy with a population that has no interest in reunification with China. To that end, the status quo has been simultaneously absurd and yet surprisingly sustainable: Taiwan is an independent country in nearly every respect, with its own border, military, currency, passports, and — pertinent to tech — economy, increasingly dominated by TSMC; at the same time, Taiwan has not declared independence, and the official position of the United States is to acknowledge that China believes Taiwan is theirs, without endorsing either that position or Taiwanese independence. Chinese and Taiwanese do, in my experience, handle this sort of ambiguity much more easily than do Americans; still, gray zones only go so far. What has been just as important are realist factors like military strength (once in favor of Taiwan, now decidedly in favor of China), economic ties (extremely deep between Taiwan and China, and China and the U.S.), and war-waging credibility. Here the Ukraine conflict and the resultant China-Russia relationship looms large, thanks to the sharing of military technology and overland supply chains for oil and food that have resulted, even as the U.S. has depleted itself. That, by extension, gets at another changing factor: the hollowing out of American manufacturing under Pax Americana has been directly correlated with China’s dominance of the business of making things, the most essential war-fighting capability. Still, there is — or rather was — a critical factor that might give China pause: the importance of TSMC. Chips undergird every aspect of the modern economy; the rise of AI, and the promise of the massive gains that might result, only make this need even more pressing. And, as long as China needs TSMC chips, they have a powerful incentive to leave Taiwan alone. Anyone who has been following the news for the last few years, however, can surely see the problem: the various iterations of the chip ban, going back to the initial action against ZTE in 2018, have the perhaps-unintended effect of making China less dependent on TSMC. I wrote at the time of the ZTE ban: What seems likely to happen in the long run is a separation at the hardware layer as well; China is already investing heavily in chips, and this action will certainly spur the country to focus on the sort of relatively low-volume high-precision components that other countries like the U.S., Taiwan, and Japan specialize in (to date it has always made more sense for Chinese companies to focus on higher-volume lower-precision components). To catch up will certainly take time, but if this action harms ZTE as much as it seems it will I suspect the commitment will be even more significant than it already is. I added two years later, after President Trump barred Huawei from TSMC chips in 2020: I am, needless to say, not going to get into the finer details of the relationship between China and Taiwan (and the United States, which plays a prominent role); it is less that reasonable people may disagree and more that expecting reasonableness is probably naive. It is sufficient to note that should the United States and China ever actually go to war, it would likely be because of Taiwan. In this TSMC specifically, and the Taiwan manufacturing base generally, are a significant deterrent: both China and the U.S. need access to the best chip maker in the world, along with a host of other high-precision pieces of the global electronics supply chain. That means that a hot war, which would almost certainly result in some amount of destruction to these capabilities, would be devastating…one of the risks of cutting China off from TSMC is that the deterrent value of TSMC’s operations is diminished. Now you can see the fly in Goldilocks’ porridge! China would certainly like the best chips from TSMC, but they are figuring out how to manage with SMIC and the Ascend and surprisingly efficient state-of-the-art models; the entire AI economy in the U.S., on the other hand — the one that is developing so nicely, with private funding pursuing the frontier, and competition and innovation up-and-down the stack — is completely dependent on TSMC and Taiwan. We have created a situation where China is less dependent on Taiwan, even while we are more dependent on the island. This is the necessary context for two more will-he-or-won’t-he ideas floated by President Trump; both are summarized in this Foreign Policy article: U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to impose tariffs on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry and has previously accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry…The primary strategic goal for the administration is to revitalize advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States…As the negotiations between TSMC and the White House unfold, several options are emerging. The most discussed option is a deal between TSMC, Intel, the U.S. government, and U.S. chip designers such as Broadcom and Qualcomm. Multiple reports indicate that the White House has proposed a deal that would have TSMC acquire a stake in Intel Foundry Services and take a leading role in its operations after IFS separated from Intel. Other reports suggest a potential joint venture involving TSMC, Intel, the U.S. government, and industry partners, with technology transfer and technical support from TSMC. The motivation for such a proposal is clear: Intel’s board, who fired Gelsinger late last year, seems to want out of the foundry business, and Broadcom or Qualcomm are natural landing places for the design division; the U.S., however, is the entity that needs a leading edge foundry in the U.S., and the Trump administration is trying to compel TSMC to make it happen. Unfortunately, I don’t think this plan is a good one. It’s simply not possible for one foundry to “take over” another: while the final output is the same — a microprocessor — nearly every step of the process is different in a multitude of ways. Transistors — even ones of the same class — can have different dimensions, with different layouts (TSMC, for example, packs its transistors more densely); production lines can be organized differently, to serve different approaches to lithography; chemicals are tuned to individual processes, and can’t be shared; equipment is tailored to a specific line, and can’t be switched out; materials can differ, throughout the chip, along with how exactly they are prepared and applied. Sure, most of the equipment could be repurposed, but one doesn’t simply layer a TSMC process onto an Intel fab! The best you could hope for is that TSMC could rebuild the fabs using the existing equipment according to their specifications. That, though, doesn’t actually solve the Taiwan problem: TSMC is still headquartered in Taiwan, still has its R&D division there, and is still beholden to a Taiwanese government directive to not export its most cutting edge processes (and yes, there is truth to Trump’s complaints that Taiwan sees TSMC as leverage to guarantee that the U.S. defends Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion). Moreover, the U.S. chip problem isn’t just about the leading edge, but also the trailing edge. I wrote in Chips and China: It’s worth pointing out, though, that this is producing a new kind of liability for the U.S., and potentially more danger for Taiwan…these aren’t difficult chips to make, but that is precisely why it makes little sense to build new trailing edge foundries in the U.S.: Taiwan already has it covered (with the largest marketshare in both categories), and China has the motivation to build more just so it can learn. What, though, if TSMC were taken off the board? Much of the discussion around a potential invasion of Taiwan — which would destroy TSMC (foundries don’t do well in wars) — centers around TSMC’s lead in high end chips. That lead is real, but Intel, for all of its struggles, is only a few years behind. That is a meaningful difference in terms of the processors used in smartphones, high performance computing, and AI, but the U.S. is still in the game. What would be much more difficult to replace are, paradoxically, trailing node chips, made in fabs that Intel long ago abandoned… The more that China builds up its chip capabilities — even if that is only at trailing nodes — the more motivation there is to make TSMC a target, not only to deny the U.S. its advanced capabilities, but also the basic chips that are more integral to everyday life than we ever realized. It’s good that the administration is focused on the issue of TSMC and Taiwan: what I’m not sure anyone realizes is just how deep the dependency goes, and just how vulnerable the U.S. — and our future in AI — really is. Everything that I’ve written until now has been, in some respects, trivial: it’s easy to identify problems and criticize proposed solutions; it’s much more difficult to come up with solutions of one’s own. The problem is less the need for creative thinking and more the courage to make trade-offs: the fact of the matter is that there are no good solutions to the situation the U.S. has got itself into with regards to Taiwan and chips. That is a long-winded way to say that the following proposal includes several ideas that, in isolation, I find some combination of distasteful, against my principles, and even downright dangerous. So here goes. The first thing the U.S. should do — and, by all means, make this a negotiating plank in a broader agreement with China — is let Chinese companies, including Huawei, make chips at TSMC, and further, let Chinese companies buy top-of-the-line Nvidia chips. The Huawei one is straightforward: Huawei’s founder may have told Chinese President Xi Jinping that Huawei doesn’t need external chip makers, but I think that the reality of having access to cutting edge TSMC fabrication would show that the company’s revealed preference would be for better chips than Huawei can get from SMIC — and the delta is only going to grow. Sure, Huawei would still work with SMIC, but the volume would go down; critically, so would the urgency of having no other choice. This, by extension, would restart China’s dependency on TSMC, thereby increasing the cost of making a move on Taiwan. At the same time, giving Huawei access to cutting edge chips would be a significant threat to Nvidia’s dominance; the reason the company is so up-in-arms about the chip ban isn’t simply foregone revenue but the forced development of an alternative to their CUDA ecosystem. The best way to neuter that challenge — and it is in the U.S.’s interest to have Nvidia in control, not Huawei — is to give companies like Bytedance, Alibaba, and DeepSeek the opportunity to buy the best. This does, without question, unleash China in terms of AI; preventing that has been the entire point of the various flavors of chip bans that came down from the Biden administration. DeepSeek’s success, however, should force a re-evaluation about just how viable it is to completely cut China off from AI. It’s also worth noting that success in stopping China’s AI efforts has its own risks: another reason why China has held off from moving against Taiwan is the knowledge that every year they wait increases their relative advantages in all the real world realities I listed above; that makes it more prudent to wait. The prospect of the U.S. developing the sort of AI that matters in a military context, however, even as China is cut off, changes that calculus: now the prudent course is to move sooner rather than later, particularly if the U.S. is dependent on Taiwan for the chips that make that AI possible. While I’ve continually made references to “chip bans”, that’s actually incomplete: the U.S. has also made moves to limit China’s access to semiconductor equipment necessary for making leading edge chips (SMIC’s 7nm process, for example, is almost completely dependent on western semiconductor equipment). Unfortunately, this effort has mostly been a failure, thanks to generous loopholes that are downstream from China being a large market for U.S. semiconductor equipment manufacturers. It’s time for those loopholes to go away; remember, the overriding goal is for China to increase its dependence on Taiwan, and that means cutting SMIC and China’s other foundries off at the knees. Yes, this increases the risk that China will develop its own alternatives to western semiconductor manufacturers, leading to long-term competition and diminished money for R&D, but this is a time for hard choices and increasing Taiwan’s importance to China is more important. The U.S.’s dependency on TSMC for trailing edge chip capacity remains a massive problem; if you think the COVID chip shortages were bad, then a scenario where the U.S. is stuck with GlobalFoundries and no one else is a disaster so great it is hard to contemplate. However, as long as TSMC exists, there is zero economic rationale for anyone to build more trailing edge fabs. This, then, is a textbook example of where government subsidies are the answer: there is a national security need for trailing edge capacity, and no economic incentive to build it. And, as an added bonus, this helps fill in some of the revenue for semiconductor manufacturers who are now fully cut off from China. TSMC takes a blow, of course, but they are also being buttressed by orders from Huawei and other Chinese chip makers. That leaves Intel and the need for native leading edge capacity, and this is in some respects the hardest problem to solve. First, the U.S. should engineer a spin-off of Intel’s x86 chip business to Broadcom or Qualcomm at a nominal price; the real cost for the recipient company will be guaranteed orders for not just Intel chips but also a large portion of their existing chips for Intel Foundry. This will provide the foundational customer to get Intel Foundry off the ground. Second, the U.S. should offer to subsidize Nvidia chips made at Intel Foundry. Yes, this is an offer worth billions of dollars, but it is the shortest, fastest route to ground the U.S. AI industry in U.S. fabs. Third, if Nvidia declines — and they probably will, given the risks entailed in a foundry change — then the U.S. should make a massive order for Intel Gaudi AI accelerators, build data centers to house them, and make them freely available to companies and startups who want to build their own AI models, with the caveat that everything is open source. Fourth, the U.S. should heavily subsidize chip startups to build at Intel Foundry, with the caveat that all of the resultant IP that is developed to actually build chips — the basic building blocks, that are separate from the “secret sauce” of the chip itself — is open-sourced. Fifth, the U.S. should indemnify every model created on U.S.-manufactured chips against any copyright violations, with the caveat that the data used to train the model must be made freely available. Here is the future state the U.S. wants to get to: a strong AI industry running on U.S.-made chips, along with trailing edge capacity that is beyond the reaches of China. Getting there, however, will take significant interventions into the market to undo the overwhelming incentives for U.S. companies to simply rely on TSMC; even then, such a shift will take time, which is why making Taiwan indispensable to China’s technology industry is the price that needs to be paid in the meantime. AI is in an exciting place; it’s also a very precarious one. I believe this plan, with all of the risks and sacrifices it entails, is the best way to ensure that all of the trees that are sprouting have time to actually take root and change the world. I wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update. This suggests a surprising takeaway: it’s possible that while RLHF on ChatGPT and especially Claude block off the 4chan elements, they also tamp down the Tumblr elements, which is to say the politics don’t come from the post-training, but from the dataset — i.e. the Internet. In other words, if I’m right about Grok 3 having a much lighter layer of RLHF, then that explains both the surface politics, and what is available under the surface. ↩ Grok doesn’t yet have a Mac app, but its iPhone app is very good ↩ Although Nvidia’s first chip was made by SGS-Thomson Microelectronics ↩ Get notified about new Articles Please verify your email address to proceed.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) stock is crashing like a ‘soufflé under a sledge hammer’ as Elon Musk predicted
URL: http://electrek.co/2025/02/25/tesla-tsla-stock-is-crashing-like-a-souffle-under-a-sledge-hammer-as-elon-musk-predicted/
Time Published: 2025-02-25T16:52:24Z
Full Content:
Tesla’s stock (TSLA) is crashing by as much as 8% today. CEO Elon Musk predicted that the stock would get crushed “like a soufflé being smashed by a sledgehammer” if it didn’t show profit growth, which is what is happening now. As we reported earlier this month, if Tesla stock doesn’t crash this quarter, Tesla will likely be trading at a 500+ P/E after reporting Q1 2025 earnings. The last time Tesla traded at these levels, Musk warned Tesla employees that the stock would get crushed “like a soufflé being smashed by a sledgehammer” if it didn’t show profit growth. It looks like the market is finally catching up as Tesla’s stock crashed 8% today: The automaker’s valuation has now dipped back below $1 trillion. Some media are linking the crash to Tesla’s sales in Europe, but it has been clear for weeks that sales are down roughly 50% in the market so far. On the positive side, Tesla launched a new FSD update in China today. The automaker will likely use that to justify the recognition of some deferred revenue, but it’s not all positive, as the update has been received with mixed reviews. I think the main factor impacting Tesla’s stock is the anticipation of reduced earnings expectations. Even with today’s 8% crash, Tesla’s stock is still trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 150, and that’s with the Bitcoin gain last quarter. If Tesla doesn’t crash more this quarter, with expected reduced earnings in Q1 due to much lower deliveries, it would likely shoot back up to a P/E of 300+. In comparison, an automaker like Toyota trades at a P/E of 7, and a technology company like Meta trades at a P/E of 40. These insane price-to-earnings ratios basically never hold, but they certainly don’t hold when earnings are going down, which is what is happening with Tesla: So many assumptions are being made that Tesla will win self driving, robotaxis, and personal robots. The truth of the matter is that Tesla is behind on all of these. With BYD throwing in full self driving on all cars, the premium for this has just dropped to near zero. Tesla unit sales, revenue and profits all accelerating downward, only hype is keeping the share price high. >60% of Tesla stock is held by institutions, so the fiduciaries at these places need to do their job and reduce exposure. If that happens price will crash. As you can see from this chart, the stock seems to only be starting to realize that it’s disconnected from its earnings, and it still has quite a bit of catching up to do. I never thought I’d find myself cheering for Tesla’s stock to continue crashing, but I feel like it’s the only way to save the company now, as the board and shareholders don’t care about anything else. Tesla’s stock crashing is the only way to get them to care about removing Elon Musk. I expect the stock to continue to crash in the coming weeks as analysts adjust their delivery expectations and then their earnings expectations for Q1. The consensus appear to still be over 400,000 deliveries in Q1, but it looks like it could be below that. Shareholders are hoping that Tesla’s planned launch of a robotaxi fleet in Austin in June will turn things around for the stock, but as I previously reported, that’s a “moving of the goal post” strategy by Elon – although it’s likely that large parts of the market don’t realize it.

The Nasdaq Composite index fell almost 1.4% on Tuesday after February consumer confidence missed expectations, coming in at 98.3 compared with the consensus of 103.0, and down from 105.3 in January — the worst decline since August. U.S. government debt rallied and the dollar weakened. The Nasdaq fell about 260 points. The S&P 500 dropped about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained by about 160 points . Money markets are now fully pricing a more than two quarter-point interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, Bloomberg News reports, even after 12-month average inflation expectations surged to 6% from 5.2%, partly driven by concern about tariffs. The Magnificent 7 shares declined more than 2% as a group. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) and Super Micro (SMCI-4.70%) shares fell in New York trading on a report — following declines in Japanese chipmakers including Tokyo Electron in Tokyo — that the U.S. is seeking tighter chip restrictions on China. Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy (MSTR+5.23%), plunged 11%, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $88,000, with other cryptocurrencies pacing the decline. The company, led by Michael Saylor, owns about 471,100 Bitcoin, making it the largest publicly traded holder of the token. Chegg (CHGG+12.80%) stock fell 33% after the online learning platform filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively affected its traffic and revenue. Home Depot (HD+0.82%) rose 2.8% after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year. Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Hims & Hers (HIMS+5.66%) stock dove 22% even after the millennial-focused telehealth company reported soaring sales for 2024 last night.

Title: Civil service staff resigns over Musk's cuts

Time Published: 2025-02-25T16:37:41Z

More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama's administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump's empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump's inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk's' Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors' badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government's ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE's government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday in masse. "We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services," they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. "This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer named Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. "I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans," Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to improve services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax. It also devised systems to improve the way the federal government purchased technology. It has been embroiled in its fair share of bureaucracy fights and agency turf wars with chief information officers across government who resented interlopers treading in their agency’s systems. USDS’ power across government stemmed from the imprimatur of acting on behalf of the White House and its founding mission of improving service for the American people.

As Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) prepares to report its fiscal fourth quarter results in the wake of DeepSeek shock, analysts are optimistic that it will beat expectations and raise its outlook as it ramps up its Blackwell chips. The chipmaker is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.33%). “Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will crush the DeepSeek anxiety,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said in comments shared with Quartz. The company dominates “the technology stack that enterprises want and the next stacks they don’t even know they need yet,” Cook said. After the Chinese artificial intelligence startup spooked investors with its competitive reasoning models in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based company released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek’s AI models — which demonstrated performance on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META+0.42%) for seemingly thousands of chips and billions of dollars less — brought Big Tech’s big spending on AI into question ahead of a spate of results from Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN+0.25%), Meta, and Microsoft. While investors waited to see if the tech giants “would lower their bold data center capex projections,” spending instead grew to $325 billion, Cook said. “This is a long-term buildout for these goliaths,” Cook said, adding that companies are not looking for immediate returns on investment, but are rather making “a three to five-year bet when their infrastructure” will be crucial to future AI development. Despite the declining costs of training and running generative AI models, “that doesn’t necessarily reflect overall spending on generative AI,” John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. While “DeepSeek didn’t introduce anything fundamentally new” about lower costs leading to higher AI adoption, Belton said, “it did slightly accelerate the rate at which training costs are declining.” However, DeepSeek’s advancements could have a near-term impact on Nvidia and other chipmakers as U.S. officials weight stricter export controls on China, Belton said. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Chinese AI firms including Tencent (TCEHY-2.67%), Alibaba (BABA-3.21%), and ByteDance are “significantly” increasing orders of Nvidia’s H20 chips as demand rises for lower-cost AI models such as those from DeepSeek. The H20 chip was designed specifically by Nvidia to comply with existing export controls targeting China, and is less advanced than chips being sold to U.S. firms. Another area of concern, Cook said, is gross margins as Nvidia delivers its Blackwell chipset, which “has been rumored to have overheating issues that may drive up costs.” Investors could be spooked if gross margins fall below 73%, he added. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) said in a note that it still expects Nvidia to deliver a beat and a raise despite supply chain issues with Blackwell. Meanwhile, FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first quarter guidance at $42 billion. “I think there was concern that DeepSeek would lead major companies to cut capital expenditures,” Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Catalyst Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Fund, said in comments shared with Quartz. “However, we’ve seen significant capex from these companies, and the market no longer seems worried about it. Nvidia’s guidance should further confirm that.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Sticky Inflation Means Gold Will Keep Rising

Time Published: 2025-02-25T16:24:55Z

By Byron King PostedFebruary 25, 2025 How much gold do you own? The correct answer is: “Not enough.” Don’t you wish you had some of these? This is a $20 gold coin from 1914, the first year of the Federal Reserve. And back then, just over 110 years ago, gold was $20 per ounce. U.S. $20 gold coin, St. Gaudens, minted 1914. Courtesy U.S. Treasury Dept. Today’s gold price is over $2,900, which means that the purchasing power of a dollar over the past century-plus has shrunk by a factor of 145x. In other words, a single dollar back in 1914 is the equivalent of $145 today. This is why people and institutions (certainly central banks) are buying gold. And it’s why gold deserves a place in every portfolio. Let’s dig into what’s happening with gold, what it means, and how to deal with it. On Jan. 20, 2025, when Donald Trump was inaugurated, an ounce of gold was quoted at $2,740. Now, a month into Trump’s second term, that same metal will set you back over $2,900, a rise of not quite 7% in just a few weeks. But don’t blame the rising gold price on Trump. Hey, after only a month in the Oval Office, this is not (yet) Trump’s economy. Many Biden administration legacies still cast shade, along with a long, deep history of federal-level misallocation of the nation’s economic power, if not the country’s money. Although yes, for sure, Trump or not, the price movement of gold foretells continuous inflation, so be prepared. The underlying problem is that inflation is embedded in the monetary system. It’s structural, or call it “sticky” inflation, to use an economic term made famous by no less than the Fed itself. And by many indicators, inflation is not going away any time soon. Looking back over just the past few years, inflation and gold prices have been rising. Here’s a chart to illustrate: Gold Price, past five years. Courtesy JM Bullion. As you can see, the price of gold began its recent, upward breakout in mid-2023 during the Biden administration. And gold has been on an uptrend ever since. So, by the beginning of this year the price of gold was already headed north. And we can only imagine how much higher the price of gold might be right now if Trump had not won the November election. Meanwhile, recall the inflation of the Biden era, aka “Bidenflation.” In truth, it was stagflation, meaning the mix of a stagnant economy and elevated inflation. Here’s a chart of those “sticky,” monthly price index moves over the past four years to remind you of what happened, courtesy of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Sticky price levels, five-year chart. Courtesy FRED. From 2021 onward, price levels went up consistently. Now, we’re living with all that cumulative inflation, a long-term hit to your purchasing power that exceeds 20% over the past four years. Stated another way, if you feel poorer, the chart above illustrates how your dollars don’t go as far at the grocery store. For the past four years, inflation shrank the value of what’s in your wallet and bank account. What’s worse is that official statistics tend to understate the reality of inflation. Government number adder-uppers often fudge towards the low end. Still, whatever numbers you follow, it’s clear that we’ve had inflation in the 3%–5% range for a while, and it feels like it when you buy a pound of bacon, or new tires, or get a quote to fix the roof. The U.S. economy finished 2024 with an official rate of inflation about 3.5%. Yet the Fed’s target goal for inflation has long been 2%, so it’s clearly not under control. There’s inflation momentum out there, with more hits yet to come. Again, keep in mind that all these inflation numbers are before Trump has submitted his first budget proposal. In fact, the federal government is running on last year’s continuing resolution to spend-spend-spend. Trump has nothing to do with it, although he and his new bestie Elon Musk are scouring the budget for items to cut and people to lay off. Trump doesn’t get a complete pass, however. Look back to the blowout federal spending in 2020 under Trump 1.0, during the first year of the pandemic. The President took some very bad advice, to be sure; but he was still the captain of the ship and went so far as to insist that U.S. Treasury checks bear his signature. So, Trump owns a chunk of past spending and current debt. But then in 2021, along came the Biden administration which opened the Treasury spigots even wider, and a flood of dollars spilled into a contracted economy. And that was the monetary kill-shot, some might say. Consider how, by 2021, unemployment was widespread and productivity was down. Likely, you recall shortages at every stage of supply chains, problems with just about everything. Remember the empty store shelves? How about the lack of toilet paper? The list is endless. Foolishly, Biden injected about two trillion dollars of vaporware Fed-bucks into this very contracted economy, which truly lit the flame of inflation. There was too much money chasing too few goods and services. Now, we have President Trump and his tenacious assistant Elon Musk, busily draining the federal swamp, ripping like a tornado through the massive federal bureaucracy in Washington. And hey, they’re getting things done! Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Courtesy Truth Social. Team Trump is on a roll, cutting budgets and closing down entire departments. This is exactly what Trump campaigned on, and he’s off to a fast start. However, the bulk of government spending is on relatively fixed expenses like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Yes, waste can be cut from these programs but there’s only so much which can realistically be cut. But let’s get back to gold, the price of which is controlled by events far beyond the powers of even the Mighty POTUS. The price of gold is set by supply and demand. As for availability, the supply of physical gold is metal above ground plus whatever new metal gets mined each year. Rising gold prices reflect the growth of money supply, an economic term for the amount of currency issued by central banks. The gold price mirrors inflation caused by central banks. Thus, it’s clear why wealthy people and deep-pocketed institutions, especially central banks, have been buying gold. They want to preserve wealth. Thus, demand is rising. Which brings us to the point that, for the past three years, many central banks have bought gold. No, the U.S. Fed wasn’t buying, sad to say. That hidebound institution disdains monetary gold. But over the past years, other central banks bought gold big time and are still in the market. For example, the central banks of Russia, China, India, Turkey, Indonesia, the Philippines and many more. In the words of the World Gold Council in 2024, “central banks continued to vacuum up gold at an eye-watering pace.” Kitco News explains that “central banks look to diversify away from the U.S. dollar.” Bones of contention with the dollar include a lack of confidence in the Fed’s interest rate manipulations, continuing inflation, and overall geopolitical instability. More and more, central banks are accumulating gold as a long-term store of value and inflation hedge. Gold is an effective portfolio diversifier with no default risk to physical holdings. Now, let’s get closer to home, meaning our portfolios. I believe it’s important to own gold in different forms: physical metal, ETFs, royalty companies, and gold miners. Physical speaks for itself. Store where you can find a safe site. This should be a multi-decade program for building generational wealth. You simply buy and hold and only spend when it’s truly necessary. Gold miners are also an attractive way to get exposure. And right now, I believe they’re cheap compared to bullion. You see, central banks are the primary buyers in today’s gold market, and they only buy bullion, not miners. There’s a big opportunity here we’ll be exploring further in the coming weeks. The entire precious metals sector is dramatically under-owned by investors today. Gold and silver investments account for less than 1% of global assets. The thinking appears to be, why buy a gold miner when you can buy soaring tech stocks? There is far too much money chasing overbought sectors like tech. If just a small amount of frothy market cap rotates into precious metal and mining shares, we’ll see massive upswings. The average investor has almost zero exposure to gold and silver, and that means prices have abundant upside potential. So no, it’s not too late to get into the gold space. Not even close.

Title: DOGE Staffers Resign After Being Asked To Dismantle ‘Critical Public Services’

WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday in masse. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good.

WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 20 civil service employees resigned Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services.” “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.” The employees also warned that many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump’s administration were political ideologues who did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them. The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president’s tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs. In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation. “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years,” Leavitt said. “President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.” The staffers who resigned worked for what was once known as the United States Digital Service, an office established during President Barack Obama’s administration after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat’s signature health care law. All had previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. Trump’s empowerment of Musk upended that. The day after Trump’s inauguration, the staffers wrote, they were called into a series of interviews that foreshadowed the secretive and disruptive work of Musk’s’ Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to the staffers, people wearing White House visitors’ badges, some of whom would not give their names, grilled the nonpartisan employees about their qualifications and politics. Some made statements that indicated they had a limited technical understanding. Many were young and seemed guided by ideology and fandom of Musk — not improving government technology. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the staffers wrote in their letter. “This process created significant security risks.” Earlier this month, about 40 staffers in the office were laid off. The firings dealt a devastating blow to the government’s ability to administer and safeguard its own technological footprint, they wrote. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the resignation letter states. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” Those who remained, about 65 staffers, were integrated into DOGE’s government-slashing effort. About a third of them quit Tuesday. “We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services,” they wrote. “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions.” The slash-and-burn effort Musk is leading diverges from what was initially outlined by Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign. DOGE, a nod to Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency meme coin, was initially presented as a blue-ribbon commission that would exist outside government. After the election, however, Musk hinted there was more to come, posting to his social media site, X, “Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!” He has leaned aggressively into the role since. Last week he stood on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering outside Washington, where he boasted of his exploits and hoisted a blinged-out, Chinese-made chainsaw above his head that was gifted by Argentinian President Javier Milei. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” Musk bellowed from the stage. Still, Musk has tried to keep technical talent in place, with the bulk of the layoffs in the Digital Service office focused on people in roles like designers, product managers, human resources and contracting staff, according to interviews with current and former staff. Of the 40 people let go earlier this month, only one was an engineer — an outspoken and politically active staffer name Jonathan Kamens, who said in an interview with the AP that he believes he was fired for publicly endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, on his personal blog and being critical of Musk in chats with colleagues. “I believe that Elon Musk is up to no good. And I believe that any data that he gains access to is going to be used for purposes that are inappropriate and harmful to Americans,” Kamens said. U.S. Digital Service veterans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, recalled experiencing a similar sort of shock about how government processes worked that Musk and his team are discovering. Over time, many developed an appreciation for why certain things in government had to be treated with more care than in the private sector. “‘Move fast and break things’ may be acceptable to someone who owns a business and owns the risk. And if things don’t go well, the damage is compartmentalized. But when you break things in government, you’re breaking things that belong to people who didn’t sign up for that,” said Cordell Schachter, who until last month was the chief information officer at the U.S. Department of Transportation. USDS was established over a decade ago to do things like improving services for veterans, and it helped create a free government-run portal so tax filers did not have to go through third parties like TurboTax.

Title: ‘Depressing Bear Market’ Potentially About To Begin for Altcoins Amid Worrying Signs in Stock Market: Veteran Trader

A seasoned trader and analyst is warning that the future appears perilous for altcoins as the US stock market flashes worrying signs. The trader pseudonymously known as The Flow Horse tells his 9,120 Telegram subscribers that with the exception of Bitcoin (BTC), crypto assets could be at the “beginning of a depressing bear market.” According to the analyst, the pump-and dump-schemes linked to memecoins witnessed over the past few weeks are “massively overdone” and could mark the “jump the shark” moment for grifting in the crypto space. According to the trader, another reason that has made him bearish is the trend shift for some US tech stocks. “Palantir, Microstrategy, Walmart, Microsoft, Coinbase, Meta, Tesla, NVIDIA – some with trend shifts and some with reminiscences of parabolic blow-offs. The worrying thing is that Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO) kind of called bullsh*t on artificial general intelligence (AGI) and this whole trend with artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures. This is not normally my area to dig into, but it’s worth remembering that a lot of the returns we are seeing in the market are in some way related to tech and AI arriving ‘better and faster’ than later. They have been a tailwind for everything, so I am concerned when those winds seem to shift at large and potentially all at once.” The Flow Horse also says that the efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to reduce the federal workforce could impact the US unemployment rate negatively and this could have a ripple effect on the market. “The actions of Elon [Musk] and [US President Donald] Trump are also kind of sketchy, so I am wondering how that impacts job reports moving forward and how the market responds to that. All in all, there is a lot of weirdness in the air, and I think this kind of feeling usually precipitates a larger drop in stocks.” According to the pseudonymously named analyst, traders will be at an advantage going forward compared to the long-term holders of altcoins. “I see a ton of opportunities for traders, but a lot of pain for people that can not let go of this idea they had of up-only altcoin season ‘just getting started.'” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Nvidia Stock Down As View Could Hinge On Tariffs And DeepSeek

Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang (C) arrives for Nvidia's end of year party in Taipei on ... [+] January 17, 2025. (Photo by CHENG Yu-chen / AFP) (Photo by CHENG YU-CHEN/AFP via Getty Images) Nvidia stock has fallen 8.4% so far in 2025. The biggest damage to the AI chip designer’s stock took place Monday, January 27 — a day after my Forbes post about DeepSeek’s R1, a complex reasoning model built for $5.7 million in three months. (The actual cost was $50 million or more – way below the $149 million spent to build Google’s Gemini, enterprise AI agent company Vectara’s CEO Amr Awadallah told CNBC). Since DeepSeek said the company used a lower-powered version of Nvidia’s GPUs, I wondered whether more large language model developers would follow DeepSeek’s lead and build models faster and more cheaply – possibly not buying as many of Nvidia’s latest, most expensive chips. The $600 billion drop in Nvidia’s stock market value that day did not deter retail investors. Instead, they have poured more than twice as much money — $5.7 billion — into Nvidia stock as of February 21 than last year, according to Vanda Research data featured by the Wall Street Journal. Will Nvidia bulls be rewarded after the company reports fiscal fourth quarter results? The answer depends on whether Nvidia beats and raises. More specifically, if Nvidia’s Q4 revenue and earnings grow faster than the FactSet consensus of 72% and 59%, respectively, and the company forecasts faster than expected growth and higher margins for the current quarter, Nvidia stock could soar. Wall Street will be focusing on whether Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell production bottlenecks are loosening, whether cloud services providers will keep spending more on data centers — in light of DeepSeek’s success with cheaper chips, and the impact of Trump’s tariffs on Nvidia’s outlook. Nvidia remains bullish about its future. The drop in the company’s stock price is an “overcorrection,” CEO Jensen Huang said, according to Yahoo! Finance. Demand for the company’s GPUs will remain strong because major processing capability is needed to enable the shift from training AI models to post-training, he added. Here are four things investors will be looking for. Nothing would be better for Nvidia bulls than a higher-than-expected growth forecast. Indeed, Nvidia’s boffo forecast for the second quarter of 2023 spurred me to write my latest book, Brain Rush. Sadly, that growth has been slowing down since the company reported faster than 200% growth every quarter between the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Here are the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rates, according to Macrotrends: As the company’s revenue growth has been declining in recent quarters, I would not be surprised if Nvidia forecasts 50% revenue growth for the current quarter. Last November, one analyst said Trump would be good for Nvidia. That prediction could be a bit off. The analyst expected higher margins and benefit from the Trump presidency. Nvidia “is on track to see Blackwell revenue surge, surpassing Hopper revenue by Apr-Q (gross margins to also recover toward mid-70's by mid-CY [calendar year] 2025),” according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino’s report feature in Barron’s. “Geopolitical uncertainties remain a headwind, but we think Nvidia is better positioned under a Trump administration.” Now reports are emerging of a policy curveball. The Trump administration has started discussions about increasing export chip curbs to China that could weigh on Nvidia’s “revenue by making it tougher to sell its products to tech companies like Alibaba Group,” according to Barron’s. Investors may be listening for what Nvidia has to say about this topic. The last time Nvidia reported quarterly earnings, Blackwell production costs were cutting into the company’s adjusted gross profit margins – which the company attributed to clearing out production bottlenecks, according to my November 2024 Forbes post. “The challenge that we have is how fast can we get that supply, getting ready, into the market this quarter,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress told analysts in the post-earnings conference call last November. “We’ll be back on track with more suppliers as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We’re just going to be tight for this quarter.” The Blackwell problems were reportedly tied to design flaws. When deployed in server racks, the chips overheated, “raising alarms about the ability to integrate them efficiently into existing data center models,” noted Reuters. Now that we are into the new calendar year, investors will be listening for whether the company has realized Kress’ hope for bottleneck relief. If not, Nvidia stock could drop. Huang said he may discuss “the ramifications of DeepSeek’s advancement for AI investments” during Wednesday’s earnings call. Recent earnings calls from hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms suggested they would spend $320 billion on data centers and related hardware in 2025. Since then, Microsoft — which had said it intends to spend more than $80 billion — has reportedly canceled some leases with “at least two private data center operators,” noted CNBC. Microsoft did not confirm this report. “Our plans to spend over $80B on infrastructure this FY remains on track as we continue to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand,” a Microsoft spokesperson emailed CNBC on February 24. Nevertheless, investors will be eager to learn whether Nvidia quantifies how much DeepSeek is likely to affect hyperscaler capital expenditures. Huang is an amazing entrepreneur and CEO and it will take all his ability to exceed investor expectations on Wednesday.

Title: How is the price of gold determined by sellers?

By Erin Gobler Edited By Angelica Leicht February 25, 2025 / 9:51 AM EST / CBS News Gold as an investment dates back to roughly 550 BC, long before modern investments like stocks and index funds, but it remains an important part of the investment landscape today. In fact, Americans generally believe gold to be a better long-term investment than stocks, savings accounts or bonds, according to a recent Gallup poll. And, interest in gold is only growing now that the price of gold has been climbing. After breaking numerous records on its price run in 2024 — and a renewed upward climb since the start of 2025 — the price of gold now sits close to $2,950 per ounce. However, that's just the spot price of gold, which isn't necessarily the same price you'll pay as an investor. So, it's important to understand how sellers set the retail price of gold, which is information you can use to find the best deal when shopping for your gold investment. Learn more about how to start investing in gold now. The current price of gold is known as its spot price. But as an investor, that's not typically the price you'll pay. "At its core, gold pricing follows a simple formula: Spot price + premium = Retail price," says Nidhi Singhvi, co-founder and CEO of the jewelry store Sonolore. The premium is an additional cost that's added to the spot price to account for business costs, including production and distribution, as well as profit margins. According to Singvi, dealers each set their own premiums and may adjust their retail prices as the spot price changes, which could happen daily. Retailers may also adjust their premiums to account for changes in the gold market, such as high demand or limited supply, even if the spot price hasn't necessarily changed. Another factor that can affect your costs is the physical form of the gold you're purchasing. For example, the choice between gold bars and coins, as well as any additional designs included, may raise or lower your costs. Generally speaking, the simpler and less processed the gold you're purchasing, the lower the premium will be. "Here is where things get interesting and opaque — premiums vary wildly by seller," says Singhvi. "A gold bar from a major retailer like Costco might have a lower markup than a boutique coin shop, while a luxury brand might charge an exorbitant premium." Gold differs from other popular investments in this way. For example, you wouldn't expect the price of a popular stock or index fund to be markedly different from one broker to the next, but you could find stark differences in the price of gold. For that reason, it's important to shop around to compare prices at various dealers. Make sure to add in any added costs, including shipping costs, transaction fees and storage (if applicable). Find out how gold could benefit your investment portfolio. When the spot price of gold increases, you can expect the retail price to rise along with it. Various factors can affect gold's spot price. For example, just like any other asset, the price of gold generally follows supply and demand. If demand is high and supply is low, the price is likely to increase. Gold prices can also be affected by economic conditions, both locally and globally. Changes in interest rates, inflation and other asset markets can all play a role. Additionally, the gold spot price may fluctuate in response to geopolitical events. The demand for gold — and, therefore, the price of gold — may increase during times of uncertainty like war or significant market downturns. Gold is traded all over the world, meaning events and economic factors in more than just the U.S. can affect its price. "While prices have already reached record highs, macroeconomic factors suggest continued demand, supporting the potential for further gains," says Joseph Cavatoni of the World Gold Council. First, gold is considered a hedge against inflation, in part thanks to its limited supply. And while inflation isn't as high today as it was just a couple of years ago, the latest data shows an uptick in the inflation rate. And according to Cavatoni, gold can protect investors from far more than inflation. "Given the current economic uncertainty, geopolitical risks, and volatility in risk assets, gold continues to prove its value as a safe-haven investment," says Cavatoni. Gold has plenty of other benefits worth considering, including portfolio diversification and liquidity, not to mention an increasing number of ways to invest. In addition to buying physical gold, investors can also opt for options like gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or gold mining ETFs. If you're going to invest in gold, knowing the spot price of gold isn't necessarily enough. After all, dealers typically add a premium to the price, which accounts for things like business costs, profit margins, gold storage, and more. If you're considering investing in gold, shop around for the best price — this can help you find a dealer that charges a lower premium. That being said, it is also helpful to monitor the current spot price and know which factors, from inflation to interest rate to market events, may impact it. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Pro Available to WrapPRO members A 2024 report finds young males (13-30) crave vulnerable male characters. But experts wonder if a cultural shift could lead Hollywood in another direction Late last year, entertainment industry tracker NRG (National Research Group) released a study concluding that 43% of young men aged 13-30 don’t know what it means to be a man in today’s society. “Like Ken in the ‘Barbie’ movie, men are struggling to figure out their own place,” the study says, referring to the hit movie’s multicultural troupe of “just Kens” who are baffled by the increasing power of women. The report also suggests Hollywood may be remiss in not filling the void. “A sizable number (47%) of those surveyed are looking to fictional characters, public figures, and celebrities for masculine role models over real people in their lives — signaling how important it is that Hollywood and celebrities present a multi-faceted view of what it means to be a man,” the authors state.

Most of the U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday as global trade tensions intensified. President Donald Trump reaffirmed that tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico will proceed once the current 30-day reprieve expires. Additionally, his administration is reportedly pushing for stricter U.S. semiconductor restrictions while urging key allies to tighten their own measures against China’s chip industry. Here are stocks to watch today: AMC Entertainment’s (AMC+3.88%) stock experienced a decline on Tuesday, slipping ahead of the company’s highly anticipated earnings report in the evening. Investors appeared cautious as they awaited quarterly results that could provide insight into the theater chain’s performance amid ongoing industry challenges. Shares of the online learning platform Chegg (CHGG+12.80%) fell on Tuesday after the company filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Google. Chegg claims that AI-generated summaries of search results have negatively impacted the company’s traffic and revenue. In the morning, shares were trading at $1.07 each, reaching a new 52-week low. Tokyo Electron (TOELY-1.38%) and other Japanese chipmakers fell in Tokyo trading after Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration is sketching out tougher versions of U.S. semiconductor curbs and pressuring key allies to escalate their restrictions on China’s chip industry. ASML Holding (ASML+0.78%) was also a subject of the talks, the news agency said. Home Depot (HD+0.82%) stock edged higher after sales in the quarter through Feb. 2 just topped Wall Street expectations. The home improvement retailer projected a 1% increase in comparable sales this fiscal year; Bloomberg reported that the average analyst estimate was for a 1.65% increase. Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) stock slipped on Tuesday as the AI chip powerhouse prepares to release its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record for a U.S. company. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-4.70%) stock fell on Tuesday following the Trump administration’s latest efforts to tighten semiconductor restrictions. Strategy (MSTR+5.23%), formerly known as MicroStrategy, declined by about 7% in New York trading, following Bitcoin, which has fallen below $90,000. The company, led by Michael Saylor, owns about 471,100 Bitcoin, making it the largest publicly traded holder of the token.

Elon Musk’s DOGE layoffs could impact more than just federal workers. They pose a growing risk to the economy, one prominent economist says. According to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, the number of jobs cut could number 1 million because federal contractors are also likely to take a hit. People who work on government contracts comprise more than two-thirds of the overall federal workforce. And while President Donald Trump frequently points to the stock market’s performance as an indicator of his success, Slok and others are warning about the prospect of a market correction in the wake of Trump’s policies. Apple CEO Tim Cook Apple said it will invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, including plans to build a new factory in Houston and add 20,000 jobs, just days after CEO Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump. The factory will be used to manufacture servers the company plans to deploy to support its artificial intelligence platform, Apple Intelligence. Berkshire Hathaway stock rallied to an all-time high Monday after a strong fourth-quarter earnings report, enriching CEO Warren Buffett’s net worth by $6 billion. Berkshire, which one analyst called “an attractive stock in an uncertain macro environment,” surpassed Tesla to become the seventh-most valuable public American company. President Donald Trump said on Monday that the planned 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are “on time” and “on schedule” to be enacted early next month after being delayed for 30 days. Trump added that the tariffs would make the U.S. “extremely liquid and rich again,” though economists have warned they could have negative impacts. The price of Bitcoin slid below the $90,000 mark on Tuesday, down nearly 7.5% from the previous 24 hours and dropping to its lowest level since mid-November. The token’s value has fallen more than 19% since it hit an all-time high of $109,114 on the day of Trump’s inauguration last month. Dan Bongino Dan Bongino is President Donald Trump’s pick for Deputy FBI Director, a position that does not require Senate approval. In addition to earnings from his podcast and radio show, Bongino has a nearly $160 million stake in Rumble, the conservative-leaning video platform that pitches itself as a free speech alternative to YouTube. In addition to his $1 million base salary as CEO of Trump Media & Technology Group last year, former Republican congressman Devin Nunes also received a $600,000 bonus, $44.1 million in stock awards and $1.2 million in additional stock compensation. His 2024 compensation marks a 6,200% increase from the $750,000 he earned in 2023, despite Trump Media seeing a net loss of $401 million last year, according to an SEC filing. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) Congressional negotiations to avoid a government shutdown appear to have reached an impasse as Democrats suggest they could withhold their votes in protest of President Donald Trump’s and Elon Musk’s broad spending cuts to congressionally appropriated funds. The current spending plan expires on March 14, and Republicans, facing an even thinner House majority, have previously relied on Democratic votes to pass a deal. MORE: Nearly $1 trillion in potential cuts to Medicaid have divided the GOP ahead of an expected vote Tuesday on a spending blueprint that would kickstart the legislative process for enacting Trump’s policy agenda. The fiscal year 2025 spending plan would likely lead to about $800 billion in cuts over the next decade from Medicaid, which provides health care coverage to more than 72 million Americans. The Trump Administration is reportedly backing down on a threat to fire workers who don’t respond to Elon Musk’s directive asking them to say what they did last week after several agency heads, including FBI Director Kash Patel and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, told their employees not to respond. Though Trump defended the email plan, his administration informed federal agencies that it is now “voluntary” for employees to respond to Musk’s email and they will not be fired if they do not, according to the New York Times. Jalen Hurts of the Philadelphia Eagles holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl LIX. The Philadelphia Eagles are planning to visit the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory if they are invited, according to multiple reports, following backlash on social media from right-wing users who bashed the team over claims it planned to skip the tradition. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has reportedly criticized President Donald Trump in the past, saying in a private meeting with NFL team owners in 2018 that Trump’s first presidency was “disastrous,” according to the New York Times. Illustration by Cecilia Runxi Zhang for Forbes TOPLINE Many of America’s best-known and most dynamic tech companies are among the top employers for folks on H-1B visas, from Amazon to Microsoft and Google, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security. “It’s more than an immigration policy,” biotech billionaire and Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong recently told Forbes. The South African immigrant came to Los Angeles as a surgical resident in 1980 and says these visas are “living proof of the American dream in action.” Elon Musk, the nation’s most famous immigrant today, is another huge fan of H-1Bs, and his electric vehicle company, Tesla, is now among the top 25 U.S. employers using such visas, the first time it appears in the ranks. Created in 1990, the H-1B visa was designed to spur immigration of talented workers like scientists, engineers and educators. The temporary visa, which lasts up to three years and can be renewed, quickly became a popular hiring tool in Silicon Valley. For years, the number of visas awarded annually—via a lottery system—varied, ranging from 48,600 new visas issued in 1992 to 163,600 in 2001. Since 2006, the cap has been fixed at 85,000 annually—20,000 of which are reserved for foreign workers who obtain a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. university. By Forbes’ count, roughly 12% of American billionaires are immigrants, but only a handful benefited personally from an H-1B visa early in their career here. They include Jeff Skoll, the Canadian engineer who was eBay’s first president, Eric Yuan, the Chinese-born founder and CEO of Zoom, and Jayshree Ullal, the CEO of computer networking firm Arista Networks who was born in London and raised in India. WHY IT MATTERS “H-1B visas have become the recent subject of political debate. Advocates such as Elon Musk have defended the program, lauding its ability to drive innovation and recruit highly specialized talent, while other political figures, including Steve Bannon, worry that it undercuts American workers,” says Forbes contributor Julie Goldenberg. “But we found a handful of immigrant billionaires who got their start with the help of an H-1B. And many of the biggest tech companies in the country rely on these visas to hire highly skilled workers.” MORE Immigrant Tech Workers Scrambling To Secure Visas Ahead Of Trump’s Inauguration Tax filing season is off to a sluggish start, IRS data shows, amid federal turmoil that has impacted the agency.

Title: Hubert Horan: Can Uber Ever Deliver? Part Thirty-Five: What Drove Uber’s Recent $8 Billion P&L Improvement?

Yves here. Hubert Horan summarizes the state of play with Uber after 2024. By Hubert Horan, who has 40 years of experience in the management and regulation of transportation companies (primarily airlines) and has been publishing analysis of Uber since 2016. Horan has no financial links with any urban car service industry competitors, investors or regulators, or any firms that work on behalf of industry participants. Uber and Lyft both reported full year GAAP profits for 2024. Both companies reported their 2024 financials earlier this month. After correcting the results for known issues, this paper will explain how Uber achieved an $8 billion P&L improvement after losing $33 billion in its first 13 years. It will also discuss the huge divergence in Uber/Lyft stock performance, and why neither stock improved after releasing strong 2024 P&L results. It will also cover why autonomous vehicles—a business both companies abandoned—have once again become a major focus. Uber Is Earning Small Profits but Continues to Mislead Investors About its Financial Performance Uber had an operating profit of $2.8 billion and an operating margin of 6.4% in 2024. This was up from $1.1 billion (3.0%) in 2023, the first year Uber ever reported profits. It reported a 2024 net profit of $9.8 billion (22.4% margin; up from $1.9 billion (5.1%) in 2023) but, as will be discussed below, badly misrepresents the actual 2024 performance of its ongoing operations As this series has documented, Uber includes multi-billion dollar items in its quarterly/annual operating results that have nothing to do with the current performance of ongoing business operations, and makes no effort to lay out the actual P&L of ongoing operations. Uber’s most dubious practice is including its estimate of the changes of value in untradeable securities it received after shutting down operations that had been hopelessly unprofitable These include shares in larger companies that had driven Uber out of the market (Didi in China, Yandex in Russia, Grab in Southeast Asia) and in Aurora, which acquired Uber’s failed autonomous vehicle development efforts. This practice dates to its IPO prospectus, when it used the alleged appreciation of untradeable securities to inflate its bottom-line 2018 profitability by $5 billion, in the hope of creating the impression of robust, rapidly improving profitability. [1] Uber’s 2024 and 2023 “net profitability” were each inflated by $1.8 billion thanks to the claimed value of paper associated with discontinued operations. $6.4 billion of Uber’s fourth quarter 2024 bottom line was due a tax valuation release. Thanks to Uber’s staggering 2010-23 losses (over $33 billion) it had deferred tax assets it could not report until there was some reasonably likelihood of positive income to offset. Uber claims it has over $41 billion in deferred tax assets, primarily from net operating losss carryforwards, research and development credits and from fixed and intangible assets where the tax basis exceeds book value.[2] Presumably Uber’s 4Q 24 $6.4 billion claim accords with IRS regulations. The issue is how investors are supposed to interpret Uber’s 2024 P&L. Its SEC filings include a one sentence footnote mentioning the tax valuation release but do not explain where it came from, what specific events triggered the 4Q 24 claim, why it was $6.4 billion, or whether investors should expect similar tax asset impacts in the future. And while Uber could not report the $6.4 billion until specific criteria had been met, it obviously has nothing to do with Uber’s 4Q 24 business performance. Uber faced a similar problem when it recorded $5 billion in stock based compensation expense as a 2Q 19 event, even though it covered work performed over multiple years. Then, as now, Uber’s published financials made no attempt to isolate these items so investors could not determine the true P&L results for current periods. The graph above illustrates the gap between Uber’s reported net profit margin, and a net margin corrected to only include items related to its ongoing business operations during the reported time period. Uber overstated current P&L performance by 18 points in 2024 and 5 points in 2023, and overtime Uber rendered GAAP net profitability meaningless for any investor that was trying to track profit improvement over time. Even when Uber was producing massive losses its P&L did not have the huge volatility that its reported numbers suggested. Uber produced meaningless GAAP net profit numbers because they wanted investors and other outsiders to focus on its even more bogus “Adjusted EBITDA Profitability” metric, which measures neither EBITDA nor profitability.[3] Since 2019 Uber has excluded over $21 billion of expenses from this “EBITDA Profitability” metric other than interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. This practice allows Uber PR to claim a “profit margin” 10-12 points higher than its corrected GAAP net margin in the last three years. Prior to the pandemic when Uber was desperate to mask how far the company was from GAAP breakeven it was claiming a profit margin 24-32 points higher. This PR strategy has been successful. Media and financial analyst reports almost exclusively evaluate Uber profitability based on the bogus “Adjusted EBITDA Profitability” and only mention reported GAAP net profits in passing. Additionally, Uber’s SEC reporting is designed to make it impossible for outsiders to determine what drove observed changes to bottom line results. Uber only publishes a single demand metric (“trips”) making it impossible to determine the relative growth rates by product (car services and food delivery) or geographic markets or to determine how unit costs and unit revenues have changed. This measure does not distinguish between a 10 block trip and a 50 mile trip. Uber also makes it very difficult to evaluate changes in how gross customer payments are split between Uber and its drivers. A first approximation of driver revenue can be gleaned by subtracting “Uber Revenue” from “Gross Revenue” but most driver bonuses and incentive payments are buried within Uber’s “Cost of Revenue” and “Sales and Marketing” expense lines. Uber also never isolated expenses related to potential future lines of business (e.g. autonomous vehicles, freight, flying cars) so one could not accurately identify the cost of its current operations. While Miniscule, 2024 Saw Lyft’s First-Ever Reported Profit. Lyft had a small operating loss ($112 million, negative 2% margin) in 2024 but eked out a $22 million net profit (0% margin). This was a notable year-over-year improvement. It had a negative 8% operating margin and a negative 12% margin in 2023. Lyft’s SEC reporting is less opaque than Uber’s, and car services are its only business. The overwhelmingly biggest factor driving its year-over-year P&L improvement was that it managed to increase its share of gross customer payments from 32% to 36%. This was a labor to capital wealth transfer of $634 million. Lyft’s revenue per trip increased by 12% while gross driver receipts per trip fell by 6%. As will be discussed below Lyft’s 2024 improvements mimic gains Uber achieved in 2022. Had this “take rate” not improved, Lyft would have lost twice as much money as they did in 2023 and had a negative 12% net margin Lyft conducted a major cost reduction program in late 2022, and 2023 costs per ride fell 26%. But these impacts seem to have dissipated as 2024 unit costs increased by 4%. Three Major Changes Drove Uber’s $8 Billion Annual 2019-2024 Profit Turnaround As discussed above, reported net earnings are useless for analyzing how Uber’s performance has changed over time due and must be corrected to eliminate major distortions (which significantly inflated net earnings in 2018,21,23 and 24 and depressed them somewhat in 2022 and 22) and accounting timing problems (which badly understated 2019 earnings and significantly overstated 2024 earnings). The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. ($ billions) 2018 2019 2022 2023 2024 Reported Net Income [4] ($4,033) $997 ($496) ($9,142) $1,887 Reported Net Margin 9% (60%) (29%) 5% 22% After eliminating discontinued ops and Timing issues Corrected Oper Income (3,424) (6,115) (1,832) 1,110 2,799 Corrected Oper Margin (30%) (43%) (6%) 3% 6% Corrected Net Income (5,338) (6,025) (1,929) 73 2,022 Corrected Net Margin (47%) (43%) (6%) 0% 5% Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes. Even when corrected for discontinued operations and timing issues, the simple ratio of total Uber expenses per trip is 24% higher in 2024 than it was in 2019 even though trip volumes increased 63%, and Uber eliminated major tranches of unproductive costs (e.g. autonomous vehicle development, low margin trips). One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers. With that unconstrained market power, Uber has been able to raise fares with impunity and impose algorithmic pricing systems because passengers will never see competitive offerings and will have no legal/regulatory protections against discriminatory or deceptive pricing practices. Uber has thus been able to transfer billions from drivers into its own pockets, since no competitor will offer better terms, and Uber can overwhelm any judicial or legislative efforts to enforce minimum standards. Without that unconstrained market power, Uber would still be losing billions every year, and would have no plausible path to breakeven. Three major factors, working in combination, created and will continue to sustain this anti-competitive market power. The first was that Uber demonstrated a willingness to employ predatory pricing to a level that would have made Rockefeller and Carnegie blush. The investors who controlled Uber were always totally focused on achieving quasi-monopoly power because this was the only way they could ever achieve returns on the $13 billion they had invested. Even when Uber was losing $6 billion a year and enduring scandals and bad publicity it was universally understood that Uber would use its massive cash position to crush any potential competitive challenge. This barrier to entry became even more impregnable once Uber achieved positive cash flow. The second factor was Uber’s willingness to employ scorched earth techniques to crush any attempt to place any external constraints on its market power. Uber effectively achieved total deregulation of urban car services totally outside the democratic processes that established public oversight. To cite one of many examples, when the California Supreme Court established rules for determining when outside contractors were truly independent and thus were not entitled to employee labor law protections, and the California legislature codified these rules into law, Uber led a $200 million effort known as Proposition 22 to overturn them. Uber outspent supporters of the independent contractor legislation by a 10:1 margin and falsely claimed that a big majority of Uber drivers opposed the rules. But by crushing the California judiciary and legislature Uber achieved the power that made the $6 billion in annual labor to capital wealth transfers that drove its path to breakeven possible. [4] The stock market, which fully understood the importance of using market power to suppress driver compensation to the lowest level possible, immediately raised the market capitalization of Uber by $36 billion (over 60%) even though passenger payments were still covering less than 70% of Uber’s actual costs. The third factor was Uber’s extraordinary narrative development/promulgation skills, which hugely contributed to the first two factors. Unlike most “tech” startups at that time, Uber made spending on PR and lobby a top corporate priority from day one. Its original messaging, copied directly from longstanding libertarian efforts, blamed all of the problems of traditional taxis on corrupt regulators. Since anyone concerned about consumers, workers or the efficient operation of urban transport infrastructure was corrupt and evil, the capital accumulators how had invested in Uber should be given the “freedom” to do whatever they thought might maximize their investment returns. This narrative positioned Uber as a heroic disruptor, whose innovative technology could solve all of the problems that had plagued urban car services for a hundred years. Even though urban transport had never attracted the interest of capital markets, Uber claimed it would soon achieve Amazon-like meteoric demand and valuation growth. None of these claims about industry problems and solutions were backed with any supporting evidence and Uber’s PR narratives remained powerful even after it accumulated $33 billion in losses, and even after its post-pandemic fares have proven to be much higher than the traditional taxis they “disrupted” had charged. [5] Uber’s narrative/PR power also rendered the mainstream and business media pliant. They meekly accept Uber’s preferred framings (regulators were corrupt, drivers didn’t want legal protections, Adjusted EBITDA is a legitimate measure of profit), make no effort to investigate service, pricing and working condition changes, to explain why Uber lost $33 billion or how it achieved $8 billion in profit improvement. Uber illustrates the magnitude of damage the rest of society can suffer when capital accumulators can destroy market competition. A handful of Uber investors and executives have become fabulously wealthy. But they destroyed a functioning taxi industry (and the capital and workers it employed) and replaced it with car service that is more limited and higher cost while reducing wages and job security. Transit systems (and the taxpayers funding them) suffered major losses thanks to traffic diverted by Uber’s predatory uneconomical fares. Traditional taxis were resilient but Uber and Lyft will be free to ignore any marketplace forces they might find inconvenient. Uber, Lyft stock prices have been behaving quite differently since mid-2022 Like the other “tech unicorns” of the past couple decades, Uber and Lyft were never designed along Finance 101 lines where they would attract investors with business plans that demonstrated strong likelihood of future profits, and where share prices reflected the market’s judgement about the stream of risk-adjusted future profits. Capital markets had become fixated on the possibility that selected companies could become super high flyers, producing meteoric demand growth and equity appreciation, making its founders and early investors stratospherically wealthy. Financial analysts and journalists paid almost no attention to the specific business model of startups like Uber and Lyft or the industry they were seeking to enter, or to whether their economics were like previously successful unicorns (Google, Facebook, Amazon, et.al.) or whether early results demonstrated they were on track to deliver on their promises. The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price. [7] Uber equity began appreciating again just at the point when Lyft equity fell to its lowest levels, triggered by Uber’s big $36 billion gain following its Proposition 22 victory over the California judicial and legislative efforts to prevent the misclassification of many drivers as independent contractors. Between mid-2022 and early 2024 Uber’s appreciation roughly tracked broad indices of “tech” stocks, although with a larger gap then was seen following its IPO. Uber’s share price has fluctuated between a 40% and 60% premium over its IPO price for the past five quarters. [8] Wall Street clearly celebrates companies who can use artificial market power to suppress wages, but Uber’s California triumph cannot explain why Uber stock began appreciating in line with “tech” indices while Lyft remained in the doldrums. Both companies employ the exact same ridesharing business model, and Lyft received the same Proposition 22 benefits that Uber did. It is perhaps useful to see Uber as a “memestock”—not in the sense of companies like GameStop or AMC who saw huge valuation changes purely due to viral social media posts, but along the lines of dot-com stocks and other major market fads. Thanks to its powerful PR/propaganda messaging over the years, Uber convinced many that it was a high-growth “tech” stock like Amazon, with years of profitable Amazon-like expansion into new businesses. Uber was never seen as risky as Lyft and the many other smaller “tech” companies now trading at a fraction of their IPO prices. To some extent Uber’s ruthless, predatory behavior may have created the image of a 900 pound gorilla impervious to normal economic laws not dissimilar to corporate behemoths like Amazon. Uber equity value continues to depend on the widespread impression that it is still a high-flying growth stock, which cannot be explained in objective financial terms. A share price above IPO levels and growing steadily implies that investors believe that Uber will enjoy years of robust demand and profit growth, and Lyft will not. While the high-flying growth image certainly helps senior executives achieve bonuses based on stock price increases, those executives will face a major challenge producing the rapid, profitable growth investors are hoping for. Most things Uber could do to boost growth (lower prices, more capacity) would be unprofitable and would reverse its post-pandemic efficiency gains. The things Uber has been doing to increase margins (reduce capacity, raise fares, squeeze drivers, eliminate speculative spending on new businesses) would cut growth. Uber’s stock price has never been sensitive to incremental P&L improvements did not meaningfully respond when it actually achieved its first profits in 2023-24. Despite the seemingly positive P&L numbers, the stocks of both Uber and Lyft both fell (7% and 5% respectively) after their 2024 financial reports. Press reports blamed both on weaker-than-expected demand forecasts for the balance of the year, illustrating the importance of growth expectations. [9] Analyst questions to the CEOs ignored issues like the risks of Uber-Lyft price wars, or where Uber’s $6 billion tax credit came from and focused instead on how they would realize the growth potential of autonomous vehicles, a previous market fad that both companies had abandoned but now appears to have come back to life. Both CEO’s made general claims about how could provide a wonderful platform for any future AV operators, while sidestepping the questions of how a future AV industry might actually develop. This strategy assumes the ridesharing companies could establish a quasi-monopoly middleman position in the future AV industrty (akin to Google’s dominance of search or Facebook’s social media position) when no other urban transport companies see it as a useful middleman. [10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers. Working with the owners of multi-billion dollar AV fleets (including companies as large as Tesla and Waymo) might pose more difficult challenges. ______ [1] “Can Uber Ever Deliver?

Lyft had a small operating loss ($112 million, negative 2% margin) in 2024 but eked out a $22 million net profit (0% margin). This was a notable year-over-year improvement. It had a negative 8% operating margin and a negative 12% margin in 2023. Lyft’s SEC reporting is less opaque than Uber’s, and car services are its only business. The overwhelmingly biggest factor driving its year-over-year P&L improvement was that it managed to increase its share of gross customer payments from 32% to 36%. This was a labor to capital wealth transfer of $634 million. Lyft’s revenue per trip increased by 12% while gross driver receipts per trip fell by 6%. As will be discussed below Lyft’s 2024 improvements mimic gains Uber achieved in 2022. Had this “take rate” not improved, Lyft would have lost twice as much money as they did in 2023 and had a negative 12% net margin Lyft conducted a major cost reduction program in late 2022, and 2023 costs per ride fell 26%. But these impacts seem to have dissipated as 2024 unit costs increased by 4%. Three Major Changes Drove Uber’s $8 Billion Annual 2019-2024 Profit Turnaround As discussed above, reported net earnings are useless for analyzing how Uber’s performance has changed over time due and must be corrected to eliminate major distortions (which significantly inflated net earnings in 2018,21,23 and 24 and depressed them somewhat in 2022 and 22) and accounting timing problems (which badly understated 2019 earnings and significantly overstated 2024 earnings). The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. ($ billions) 2018 2019 2022 2023 2024 Reported Net Income [4] ($4,033) $997 ($496) ($9,142) $1,887 Reported Net Margin 9% (60%) (29%) 5% 22% After eliminating discontinued ops and Timing issues Corrected Oper Income (3,424) (6,115) (1,832) 1,110 2,799 Corrected Oper Margin (30%) (43%) (6%) 3% 6% Corrected Net Income (5,338) (6,025) (1,929) 73 2,022 Corrected Net Margin (47%) (43%) (6%) 0% 5% Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes.

While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually.

[9] Analyst questions to the CEOs ignored issues like the risks of Uber-Lyft price wars, or where Uber’s $6 billion tax credit came from and focused instead on how they would realize the growth potential of autonomous vehicles, a previous market fad that both companies had abandoned but now appears to have come back to life. Both CEO’s made general claims about how could provide a wonderful platform for any future AV operators, while sidestepping the questions of how a future AV industry might actually develop. This strategy assumes the ridesharing companies could establish a quasi-monopoly middleman position in the future AV industrty (akin to Google’s dominance of search or Facebook’s social media position) when no other urban transport companies see it as a useful middleman. [10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers. Working with the owners of multi-billion dollar AV fleets (including companies as large as Tesla and Waymo) might pose more difficult challenges. ______ [1] “Can Uber Ever Deliver?

The corrected numbers show that Uber was losing $5-6 billion a year (negative 43-47 margin) before the pandemic. It then achieved a $4 billion improvement by 2022 (nearly 40 margin points) when it lost $2 billion (negative 6% margin) and then achieved further $2 billion improvements (5-7 margin points) in both 2023 and 2024. Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. Uber increased its reported “take rate” from 22% of each dollar of customer payments in 2018-19 to 28% since 2022. In 2024 its ridesharing take rate exceeded 30%. Uber reduced the driver share of gross revenue from 78% to 72%. Most of this wealth transfer occurred in 2022, when Uber revenue increased (and driver revenues decreased) by $6.5 billion. If the take rate had remained at 22% Uber’s corrected net loss in 2022 would have been $8.5 billion with a negative 34% net margin. This value increased to $8 billion in 2024, given growth in trip volumes. Perhaps more detailed data could produce a more precise measure of Uber/driver revenue shares but Uber is unwilling to share that data. As the earliest pieces in this series explained, car services face major structural problems that limit service quality and efficiency, such as extreme demand peaking and empty backhauls. With pre-Uber traditional taxis these costs were effectively shared between drivers and car owners. Uber’s business model did not reduce any of these costs, it simply shifted all of them onto the shoulders of the drivers. During the pandemic Uber also eliminated marginal operations and many expenses not directly related to current car or food delivery services. Prior to the pandemic Uber flooded cities with capacity at low fares as it pursued market dominance and very high growth rates. But due to empty backhauls, demand peaking and other issues much of this capacity was especially unprofitable, and Uber made big cuts. Again, Uber is unwilling to share data that would allow outsiders to calculate unit cost and utilization/productivity changes. Even when corrected for discontinued operations and timing issues, the simple ratio of total Uber expenses per trip is 24% higher in 2024 than it was in 2019 even though trip volumes increased 63%, and Uber eliminated major tranches of unproductive costs (e.g. autonomous vehicle development, low margin trips). One plausible guess is that this cost cutting (which should have been largely exhausted by 2022) reduced losses by roughly 10 margin points, based on the comparison of actual 2019 margins (negative 43%) and the negative 34% 2022 margins that would have been seen if Uber’s take rate had remained at the 2019 22% level. Uber’s algorithmic pricing and driver payment practices replaced pre-pandemic systems where these were linked to trip time and distance and drivers could see the relationship of their payment to what the passenger had paid. Uber now puts payment offers for rides out to drivers, who if they fail to accept low offers run the risk of failing to meet utilization targets and being locked out of the system. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence from drivers about how this has depressed their earnings there is no way to estimate the impacts on Uber’s P&L or aggregate driver compensation, and Uber is especially zealous about hiding the effects from drivers and investors. It presumably helped drive Uber’s ridesharing take rate increase (27% to 30%) between 2022 and 2024, which was worth over $2.5 billion annually. Uber Could Not Have Achieved Profitability Without Massive Anti-Competitive Market Power Looking at the bigger picture, the real driver of Uber’s profit turnaround is that it has achieved large and sustainable levels of anti-competitive market power. Uber is totally immune from any threat of discipline from either marketplace competition or laws or regulations established by democratically elected governments designed to protect general public interests or the specific interests of consumers or workers. With that unconstrained market power, Uber has been able to raise fares with impunity and impose algorithmic pricing systems because passengers will never see competitive offerings and will have no legal/regulatory protections against discriminatory or deceptive pricing practices. Uber has thus been able to transfer billions from drivers into its own pockets, since no competitor will offer better terms, and Uber can overwhelm any judicial or legislative efforts to enforce minimum standards. Without that unconstrained market power, Uber would still be losing billions every year, and would have no plausible path to breakeven. Three major factors, working in combination, created and will continue to sustain this anti-competitive market power. The first was that Uber demonstrated a willingness to employ predatory pricing to a level that would have made Rockefeller and Carnegie blush. The investors who controlled Uber were always totally focused on achieving quasi-monopoly power because this was the only way they could ever achieve returns on the $13 billion they had invested. Even when Uber was losing $6 billion a year and enduring scandals and bad publicity it was universally understood that Uber would use its massive cash position to crush any potential competitive challenge. This barrier to entry became even more impregnable once Uber achieved positive cash flow. The second factor was Uber’s willingness to employ scorched earth techniques to crush any attempt to place any external constraints on its market power. Uber effectively achieved total deregulation of urban car services totally outside the democratic processes that established public oversight. To cite one of many examples, when the California Supreme Court established rules for determining when outside contractors were truly independent and thus were not entitled to employee labor law protections, and the California legislature codified these rules into law, Uber led a $200 million effort known as Proposition 22 to overturn them. Uber outspent supporters of the independent contractor legislation by a 10:1 margin and falsely claimed that a big majority of Uber drivers opposed the rules. But by crushing the California judiciary and legislature Uber achieved the power that made the $6 billion in annual labor to capital wealth transfers that drove its path to breakeven possible. [4] The stock market, which fully understood the importance of using market power to suppress driver compensation to the lowest level possible, immediately raised the market capitalization of Uber by $36 billion (over 60%) even though passenger payments were still covering less than 70% of Uber’s actual costs. The third factor was Uber’s extraordinary narrative development/promulgation skills, which hugely contributed to the first two factors. Unlike most “tech” startups at that time, Uber made spending on PR and lobby a top corporate priority from day one. Its original messaging, copied directly from longstanding libertarian efforts, blamed all of the problems of traditional taxis on corrupt regulators. Since anyone concerned about consumers, workers or the efficient operation of urban transport infrastructure was corrupt and evil, the capital accumulators how had invested in Uber should be given the “freedom” to do whatever they thought might maximize their investment returns. This narrative positioned Uber as a heroic disruptor, whose innovative technology could solve all of the problems that had plagued urban car services for a hundred years. Even though urban transport had never attracted the interest of capital markets, Uber claimed it would soon achieve Amazon-like meteoric demand and valuation growth. None of these claims about industry problems and solutions were backed with any supporting evidence and Uber’s PR narratives remained powerful even after it accumulated $33 billion in losses, and even after its post-pandemic fares have proven to be much higher than the traditional taxis they “disrupted” had charged. [5] Uber’s narrative/PR power also rendered the mainstream and business media pliant. They meekly accept Uber’s preferred framings (regulators were corrupt, drivers didn’t want legal protections, Adjusted EBITDA is a legitimate measure of profit), make no effort to investigate service, pricing and working condition changes, to explain why Uber lost $33 billion or how it achieved $8 billion in profit improvement. Uber illustrates the magnitude of damage the rest of society can suffer when capital accumulators can destroy market competition. A handful of Uber investors and executives have become fabulously wealthy. But they destroyed a functioning taxi industry (and the capital and workers it employed) and replaced it with car service that is more limited and higher cost while reducing wages and job security. Transit systems (and the taxpayers funding them) suffered major losses thanks to traffic diverted by Uber’s predatory uneconomical fares. Traditional taxis were resilient but Uber and Lyft will be free to ignore any marketplace forces they might find inconvenient. Uber, Lyft stock prices have been behaving quite differently since mid-2022 Like the other “tech unicorns” of the past couple decades, Uber and Lyft were never designed along Finance 101 lines where they would attract investors with business plans that demonstrated strong likelihood of future profits, and where share prices reflected the market’s judgement about the stream of risk-adjusted future profits. Capital markets had become fixated on the possibility that selected companies could become super high flyers, producing meteoric demand growth and equity appreciation, making its founders and early investors stratospherically wealthy. Financial analysts and journalists paid almost no attention to the specific business model of startups like Uber and Lyft or the industry they were seeking to enter, or to whether their economics were like previously successful unicorns (Google, Facebook, Amazon, et.al.) or whether early results demonstrated they were on track to deliver on their promises. The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price. [7] Uber equity began appreciating again just at the point when Lyft equity fell to its lowest levels, triggered by Uber’s big $36 billion gain following its Proposition 22 victory over the California judicial and legislative efforts to prevent the misclassification of many drivers as independent contractors. Between mid-2022 and early 2024 Uber’s appreciation roughly tracked broad indices of “tech” stocks, although with a larger gap then was seen following its IPO. Uber’s share price has fluctuated between a 40% and 60% premium over its IPO price for the past five quarters. [8] Wall Street clearly celebrates companies who can use artificial market power to suppress wages, but Uber’s California triumph cannot explain why Uber stock began appreciating in line with “tech” indices while Lyft remained in the doldrums. Both companies employ the exact same ridesharing business model, and Lyft received the same Proposition 22 benefits that Uber did. It is perhaps useful to see Uber as a “memestock”—not in the sense of companies like GameStop or AMC who saw huge valuation changes purely due to viral social media posts, but along the lines of dot-com stocks and other major market fads. Thanks to its powerful PR/propaganda messaging over the years, Uber convinced many that it was a high-growth “tech” stock like Amazon, with years of profitable Amazon-like expansion into new businesses. Uber was never seen as risky as Lyft and the many other smaller “tech” companies now trading at a fraction of their IPO prices. To some extent Uber’s ruthless, predatory behavior may have created the image of a 900 pound gorilla impervious to normal economic laws not dissimilar to corporate behemoths like Amazon. Uber equity value continues to depend on the widespread impression that it is still a high-flying growth stock, which cannot be explained in objective financial terms. A share price above IPO levels and growing steadily implies that investors believe that Uber will enjoy years of robust demand and profit growth, and Lyft will not. While the high-flying growth image certainly helps senior executives achieve bonuses based on stock price increases, those executives will face a major challenge producing the rapid, profitable growth investors are hoping for. Most things Uber could do to boost growth (lower prices, more capacity) would be unprofitable and would reverse its post-pandemic efficiency gains. The things Uber has been doing to increase margins (reduce capacity, raise fares, squeeze drivers, eliminate speculative spending on new businesses) would cut growth. Uber’s stock price has never been sensitive to incremental P&L improvements did not meaningfully respond when it actually achieved its first profits in 2023-24. Despite the seemingly positive P&L numbers, the stocks of both Uber and Lyft both fell (7% and 5% respectively) after their 2024 financial reports. Press reports blamed both on weaker-than-expected demand forecasts for the balance of the year, illustrating the importance of growth expectations.

[10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers.

The emphasis was totally on narrative, buzzwords (disruption, platforms, innovation, etc.) and the personalities of the top executives and venture capital investors. Both Uber and Lyft went public in the first half of 2019, with (as this series documented) IPO prospectuses that documented huge losses and provided no credible evidence of sustainable profits in the future. Uber’s prospectus highlighted that it expected to become the “Amazon of Transportation”, that its investment in autonomous cars would fuel long-term growth and that investors’ expectations about the future should recognize that it currently served less than 1% of its “addressable market” (global trips within urban areas). The two IPOs created $80 billion in corporate value ($65 bn Uber, $15 bn Lyft) although they had been seeking $150 billion ($120 bn Uber, $30 bn Lyft). [6] As the two graphs below illustrate the stock prices of Uber and Lyft quickly fell below their IPO levels and failed to appreciate in line with general “tech” indices. Oddly, the huge pandemic demand collapse did not have a major impact on either stock. Until mid-2022 Uber stock clearly did a bit better than Lyft’s although they roughly tracked each other, including serious declines in 2021-22. But in mid-2022 the paths of the two stocks dramatically diverged. Lyft, which had been trading roughly 20% below its IPO price ($72) in 2021 fell to roughly 80% below in mid-2022 and has remained at that level ever since. The mid-2022 equity collapse coincides with major declines across a wide range of so-called disruptive tech-based startup stocks as investors appeared to be growing tired of companies who were burning cash in pursuit of rapid growth but did not have a clear path to sustainable profitability. These companies lived in what one observer called “the enchanted forest of the unicorns” where your valuation is whatever you say it is and received little serious scrutiny when they went public and only avoided collapse because of investors “consensual hallucination” (and low interest rates). The major restructuring efforts Lyft announced in the 2nd quarter of 2023, the recovery of pandemic traffic declines and its subsequent reduction in losses have had had little impact on its share price. [7] Uber equity began appreciating again just at the point when Lyft equity fell to its lowest levels, triggered by Uber’s big $36 billion gain following its Proposition 22 victory over the California judicial and legislative efforts to prevent the misclassification of many drivers as independent contractors. Between mid-2022 and early 2024 Uber’s appreciation roughly tracked broad indices of “tech” stocks, although with a larger gap then was seen following its IPO. Uber’s share price has fluctuated between a 40% and 60% premium over its IPO price for the past five quarters. [8] Wall Street clearly celebrates companies who can use artificial market power to suppress wages, but Uber’s California triumph cannot explain why Uber stock began appreciating in line with “tech” indices while Lyft remained in the doldrums. Both companies employ the exact same ridesharing business model, and Lyft received the same Proposition 22 benefits that Uber did. It is perhaps useful to see Uber as a “memestock”—not in the sense of companies like GameStop or AMC who saw huge valuation changes purely due to viral social media posts, but along the lines of dot-com stocks and other major market fads. Thanks to its powerful PR/propaganda messaging over the years, Uber convinced many that it was a high-growth “tech” stock like Amazon, with years of profitable Amazon-like expansion into new businesses. Uber was never seen as risky as Lyft and the many other smaller “tech” companies now trading at a fraction of their IPO prices. To some extent Uber’s ruthless, predatory behavior may have created the image of a 900 pound gorilla impervious to normal economic laws not dissimilar to corporate behemoths like Amazon. Uber equity value continues to depend on the widespread impression that it is still a high-flying growth stock, which cannot be explained in objective financial terms. A share price above IPO levels and growing steadily implies that investors believe that Uber will enjoy years of robust demand and profit growth, and Lyft will not. While the high-flying growth image certainly helps senior executives achieve bonuses based on stock price increases, those executives will face a major challenge producing the rapid, profitable growth investors are hoping for. Most things Uber could do to boost growth (lower prices, more capacity) would be unprofitable and would reverse its post-pandemic efficiency gains. The things Uber has been doing to increase margins (reduce capacity, raise fares, squeeze drivers, eliminate speculative spending on new businesses) would cut growth. Uber’s stock price has never been sensitive to incremental P&L improvements did not meaningfully respond when it actually achieved its first profits in 2023-24. Despite the seemingly positive P&L numbers, the stocks of both Uber and Lyft both fell (7% and 5% respectively) after their 2024 financial reports. Press reports blamed both on weaker-than-expected demand forecasts for the balance of the year, illustrating the importance of growth expectations. [9] Analyst questions to the CEOs ignored issues like the risks of Uber-Lyft price wars, or where Uber’s $6 billion tax credit came from and focused instead on how they would realize the growth potential of autonomous vehicles, a previous market fad that both companies had abandoned but now appears to have come back to life. Both CEO’s made general claims about how could provide a wonderful platform for any future AV operators, while sidestepping the questions of how a future AV industry might actually develop. This strategy assumes the ridesharing companies could establish a quasi-monopoly middleman position in the future AV industrty (akin to Google’s dominance of search or Facebook’s social media position) when no other urban transport companies see it as a useful middleman. [10] Uber and Lyft have survived because they can impose whatever terms and conditions they want on their fragmented, subservient drivers. Working with the owners of multi-billion dollar AV fleets (including companies as large as Tesla and Waymo) might pose more difficult challenges. ______ [1] “Can Uber Ever Deliver?

The figure breaking down the P&L over time shows that Uber has become profitable based on the author’s adjustments in ’24. From the tone of the article, I was expecting some negative earnings bomb based on the lead-in. I can tell you with certainty that the Wall Street models are backing out all of Uber’s balance sheet and income statement esoterica to derive the same figures the author shows here. There was a strong bear case against Uber ever becoming profitable in ’21-22, and those people have essentially been proven incorrect, all accounting dodginesss aside, and anyone who was short the stock felt a ton of pain. The discussion of the labor-capital dynamic required to make that shift is, to me, a separate discussion from Uber’s dubious practices in how they represent profits. Investors have sadly not pushed them enough to remove some obfuscations, but again, a separate issue for me than the core one at hand of how profitable Uber is as a business. The other part glossed over is that drivers will often work for both Lyft and Uber taking whichever fare is best, at least in large markets. Obviously in smaller markets, Uber is more dominant being so much larger than Lyft, but those are typically places where, at least in the States, there were no meaningful taxi presence pre-ride sharing. So whatever maintenance is being paid by the drivers, that overhead is covering the cost of collecting fares from both companies, not just one. In big metros like NYC where I’m based, nearly every driver takes rides from either service interchangeably. Far be it from me to defend Uber, but I think it’s worth bearing those two things in mind. Like it or not (I personally avoid Uber if possible, and generally try to use public transit or take Lyft or a cab when I must) Uber is now a real, profitable business, and barring some unionization/regulatory changes to the industry it’s likely to remain so in the future. So going forward this pig will have the confidence to ditch the lipstick (accounting shenanigans) it used for years to punch above its attractiveness class? Will it now face the world unembelllished and unadorned? It may be a real, profitable business now but the reality is the narrative Uber ran with to seduce investors into shovelling money into its coffers hasn’t been realized. I vividly remember the pitch being about replacing car ownership entirely (with the company saying their TAM was the entire global urban mobility market), that part has entirely disappeared from its story and they failed in sweeping competitors off the deck in several key markets. Maybe i’m being a little harsh, perhaps the glass half full version is that they shot for the stars and landed on the moon. Yes, basically. This piece reads like the bear cases from 3-4 years ago but fails to adequately acknowledge how things have changed. That doesn’t make it bad; on the contrary I think the analysis and fact finding is quite good, which is why I engaged and left a comment. There’s certainly a battle to be fought over the labor-capital dynamic in Uber and nearly every other large multinational on Earth, but I worry about whether the percieved disconnect between the facts and the tone of this takedown are doing a service to that movement. Thanks for the continued reporting on Uber. Something tells me that one day that you would like to report the final death throes of Uber and gather all your essays into a book ready to print about all the shenanigans that kept this unkillable monster going for so long. I was thinking the other day that Ed Zitron is to OpenAI what Hubert Horan is to Uber. I read Ed’s latest – There Is No AI Revolution – https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/ Hubert’s articles on Uber popped in mind especially when I read the parts of about how OpenAI is continually losing money and is essentially subsidizing free and paid subscribers. I figured eventually investment into UBER by the big players was the attractiveness of the deregulation and wreckage of labor rights that followed wherever the company touched down. The throwing money at AI that is losing money…the long game is coming into focus as the games in DC and with other governments are played out. Always enjoy these as the magicians tricks are so interesting – as brazen disregard of conventions are awarded more and more often – in so many arenas – to benefit a few. Isn’t one of Ubers and Lyfts primary risks interest rates? Not for themselves but for their drivers and their ability to secure new vehicles at a lower cost – which also provide warranty repairs – for a time? There doesn’t seem any capture of “fleet age” and I wonder as time passes whether the cars being used will be older and less mechanically sound and more grungy. Another apparent profitability ploy by Uber, anyway, is reduction in customer service levels. A recent personal experience highlighted this when there the help funnel led to no way to report algorithmic errors, only driver, vehicle or safety complaints. And there was zero way to back out once a path was selected, nor any way to actually interact with a person, let alone an AI agent to discuss the problem. Whi I felt purposely and intentionally trapped. And resorting to X/Twitter was also of no use as my issue was immediatky dismissed (with a nice apology of how much they care) but no offer of appeasement as I had experienced before. This is all market power in action, I suppose. “-to benefit a few” Nowadays my pmc adjacent contacts have their hair on fire about elon when they continue to be all in on autonomous this or that predating on anything they can get their grubbies on… from the above… Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept. First they came for the gypsies… Uber’s business model is built around skirting a number of laws and regulations that protect its customers and its quasi-emploees. I’d rather pay the rentier “licence holders” or “medallion holders” than set foot in an Uber. Same goes for Lyft and AirBnB. Thank you. I had been wondering about this and hoping for an update. They do seem to have become profitable, albeit not by nearly as much as their results suggest and not to a level that would make them a particularly attractive investment. Still, it’s more than I expected given the previous columns. What I’m not sure about is why Uber has been able to maintain dominance despite no longer offering a cost advantage (I don’t know this for sure but it seems to be the case anecdotally, and the article appears to confirm it). Part 2 of the series argued that Uber has a higher cost structure than traditional operators and that there are no economies of scale to be had, and predicted that Uber would have to stop lowballing and give up its price advantage – which appears to have happened now. So what’s stopping competitors from simply undercutting them on price and gaining market share that way? Is it a de facto cartel situation where nobody wants to attract Uber’s ire, and so they all price match? Or does Uber have enough of a brand now that customers are just willing to pay more for the name, a la Coke? Your email address will not be published.

Title: 5 accessories to supercharge your Arduino projects

With their cheap price tags, massive I/O provisions, and low power consumption, microcontrollers like the uber-popular Arduino family have diverse use cases, from simple automation projects to full-on DIY robots and complex electronics circuits. While you can technically run a handful of useful scripts on your MCUs, their utility goes up a notch once you pair them with sensors, breadboards, and a host of other peripherals. But if you’re just starting out, here’s a quick list of the most useful components for your Arduino boards. From DIY 3D printers to FPV drones, there's a lot you could do with your Arduino microcontroller Often mistaken for microcontrollers by beginners, SBCs are more powerful than their MCU brethren. Rather than being featured in DIY plans involving heavy circuitry, Single-Board Computers are often used in computing and programming projects. But that doesn’t change the fact that these tiny boards can enhance the functionality of your Arduino-based tinkering ideas. For instance, you can pair your custom-built gamepad with a retro gaming war machine of an SBC. Alternatively, you can turn your tiny computing board into a Home Assistant hub and pair it with your arsenal of microcontrollers to automate every aspect of your living space. Heck, if you’re unable to access your PC, you can even turn a makeshift Raspberry Pi laptop into a dedicated Arduino programming machine! If you want to dabble in circuit components without soldering everything onto your microcontroller, you’ll have a blast with breadboards. For the uninitiated, breadboards let you interface your microcontrollers with motors, sensors, and other electronic equipment in temporary setups. Besides helping you test prototypes of your wacky Arduino ideas, breadboards ensure your components can be reused once you’re done building a project. Want to build a complex circuit-based project with your SBC or microcontroller? Breadboards can make your life a lot easier! You’ll also need some jumper cables to interface the different parts of your Arduino project with the breadboard. While certain boards, like the Uno series, need a male-to-female wire, others, such as the members of the Nano family, can be directly plugged into the breadboard. Likewise, you may need male-to-male cables for the sensor modules. Ideally, you’d want to grab a set of different jumper wires, so you’re well-equipped to work on any project. While breadboards are perfect for testing your boards, sometimes, the situation calls for a more drastic, soldering approach. Perhaps you want to design compact circuits that don’t take up half your workbench. Or maybe your sensor modules won’t work unless you hardwire the different pins onto the ICs. A soldering kit is quite handy in these situations. While it may seem a bit intimidating at first, most consumer-grade solder equipment is fairly easy to work with, and with enough practice, you’ll be hardwiring your Arduino projects in no time! Capable of creating fully-customized parts for your DIY projects, a 3D printer is an amazing investment for any Arduino lover. Whether it’s mechanical components for your robotics projects, cases to safeguard your Arduino from accidental spills, or random decorations to cheer you on while you spend hours tinkering with MCUs, a 3D printer can make them all. Unfortunately, your wallet won’t be the only casualty when buying a 3D printer. If you want to design precise components for your Arduino setups, you’ll have to sink quite a bit of time into learning a CAD utility. Finally, your Arduino toolkit will be incomplete if you don't purchase some sensor and circuit modules. After all, you can’t build a precise weather station without a BME280, DHT22, DS18B20, or another temperature sensor. Likewise, ultrasonic and IR modules are indispensable for robotics projects. For folks into electrical circuits, you can stock up on resistors, LEDs, and capacitors. But if you’re into automation, it’s a good idea to grab a couple of motors and relay modules for your tiny microcontroller. Really, the sky’s the limit when it comes to inexpensive MCU add-ons! Your palm-sized Raspberry Pi can help you keep tabs on the temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity values of your surroundings If you’re still looking for other cool accessories to add to your Arduino collection, I’ve got a couple of recommendations. Multimeters and potentiometers can come in handy for your circuitry projects. You’ve also got terminal shields and breakout boards, which can extend the functionality of your Arduino. Then there's the Arduino MCU itself, and you'll be surprised at the sheer number of models circulating in the market. Heck, you can even save a few bucks by going with a third-party board, though you might end up with cheap components if you play the clone roulette. We want to hear from you!

I never thought I'd use a pen again I repurposed an old iPad and converted it into a mini Windows laptop. Here are some reasons why you should consider upgrading from mechanical hard drives to SSDs for your NAS Is a flash-only NAS better than mechanical hard drives? These devices might be wildly popular, but I still don't see the point Razer's latest Chroma products have prioritized putting RGB on everything over value and practicality.

Title: Elon Musk hates OpenAI's for-profit transformation plan. He's not the only one.

Sam Altman is attempting a thorny maneuver, transforming OpenAI from a subsidiary of a convoluted nonprofit into a more conventional business. Jungwon Byun knows what that's like. In 2023, the organization Byun cofounded, an AI lab named Ought, went through a similar transition. Launched in 2018, Ought built AI research tools and was structured as a nonprofit because its cofounders didn't expect AI to be commercially viable anytime soon, Byun said in an interview. Then ChatGPT launched, AI mania took hold, and the leadership team realized their structure might be a hindrance to raising capital and pursuing their mission. The decision was made to spin out Ought's core product, Elicit, as a for-profit company, along with most of its staff. Byun and several other executives set to lead the independent Elicit recused themselves from discussions, and a firm specializing in asset valuations was hired to independently appraise the value of Elicit so the remaining nonprofit, Ought, could be paid appropriately. (Byun declined to share the exact price, though she said Elicit chose to pay a premium on top of the recommended price.) OpenAI's planned transformation is on a far grander scale but faces similar questions and potentially more gnarly challenges. Altman wants to extricate OpenAI's revenue-generating business from its nonprofit parent, creating a more traditional company that can take in investments and give stock to shareholders who expect big returns. The process is complicated by OpenAI's complex corporate structure, the billions of dollars it has already raised from investors, and Elon Musk's attempts to block the deal. It's not just Musk though. A growing chorus of critics, including entrepreneurs, other companies and charities, investors, academics, and activists, say OpenAI may be about to make a grave mistake. Byun is one of them. "Artificial general intelligence is the most transformative technology of our lifetime, and OpenAI is absolutely at the frontier and one of the most important players in that," she told Business Insider. "So I think giving up governance rights to controlling the most important technology of our lifetime is an insanely huge decision and will affect all of humanity at a very great scale for a long time." Her advice to OpenAI's charitable parent organization: Do not sell to anyone. "I don't know, obviously, the details of what pressures they're under and what the details are of the options they're considering and how it affects the mission," Byun said. "But from what I can see, I absolutely would not sell those governance rights or give them up." OpenAI didn't respond to requests for comment over the past week. OpenAI was established as a nonprofit in 2015. Over time, its need for capital to pay for AI development prompted it to establish a for-profit subsidiary to raise venture funding and pursue business partnerships and revenue-generating products. This and various other subsidiaries are controlled by the nonprofit, which is controlled by a board of directors chaired by Bret Taylor, alongside Altman, Fidji Simo, Larry Summers, and other business luminaries. The board's main legal obligation is to further the nonprofit's charitable mission, which is to build "safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity," rather than delivering returns to shareholders. OpenAI now seeks to transition to a more conventional corporate structure, turning the for-profit subsidiary into an independent public benefit company that controls "OpenAI's operations and business." PBCs are relatively common. This approach takes into account the interests of shareholders, other stakeholders, and the public. OpenAI has said that with investors taken care of, this will help the startup raise "necessary capital with conventional terms like others in this space." OpenAI said the remaining nonprofit would receive shares in the public benefit company "at a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors." That may be the ultimate challenge — and one made more complex by potential conflicts of interest. OpenAI investors and others focused on the startup's business-focused future may prefer to pay the nonprofit less for its assets and control, leaving the new for-profit entity with more financial firepower. However, some of these people could be in positions to influence the valuation and decision-making. Musk, an OpenAI cofounder who acrimoniously split from Altman, has sued the startup over its plans. Musk and a group of other investors also made a bid in February to acquire the nonprofit parent OpenAI Inc. for $97.4 billion. That was more than half of the total value of the entire startup based on its most recent funding round. "It is in the public's interest to ensure that OpenAI, Inc. is compensated at fair market value," the Musk consortium said in a statement. "That value cannot be determined by insiders negotiating on both sides of the same table." Ellen Aprill, an expert on charities at the UCLA School of Law, said OpenAI's board has an obligation to make sure the nonprofit is getting a fair value for giving up its assets and control. "One of the very big issues is what is fair market value?" she told BI. "In particular, how much should the nonprofit get for giving up control? "Part of what Musk and his group were trying to do with this offer is to set at least some floor, some sense of what the fair market value would be," she added. "Putting it out for auction — let's see what people would pay." Taylor, the OpenAI board chairman, officially rebuffed Musk. "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," Taylor wrote in a statement. "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity." Days earlier, Altman shot the bid down with a post on X that mocked the struggles of the Musk-owned social network: "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want." Altman's post prompted some discussion of whether he was, or should be, recused from this process. "When it comes to looking at a conflicted transaction like this one, it's much easier to satisfy the court's review if you take people who are on both sides of their transaction out of the negotiations," said Peter Molk, a law professor at the University of Florida. However, he noted that under Delaware law, Altman isn't legally required to remove himself. Molk also cautioned against recusing too early. "There's value in his being there. Along the way, he can provide useful insight and information that's actually useful for OpenAI, for the nonprofit, if they're going to go ahead with that process," Molk said. "You want to try and strike a balance that allows them to do their job, that helps a transaction occur in a way that's actually beneficial to all parties, but then have them take themselves out of the picture once you're beyond that point." The existing for-profit parts of OpenAI have already raised billions of dollars in pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which the startup defines as systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. This has raised hackles among some consumer advocates. Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog, has repeatedly assailed the AI startup, accusing it of betraying its nonprofit mission. "The nonprofit board has behaved as a subordinate to the for-profit, and has done nothing that evidences any commitment to the nonprofit mission," said Robert Weissman, the copresident of Public Citizen. He argued that the solution is to forcibly dissolve the nonprofit and auction off its assets for the benefit of a new independent charity not linked to the current OpenAI board. Meta, Facebook's parent company, raised similar concerns, writing to California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, in December to ask him to step in. "Taking advantage of this non-profit status, OpenAI raised billions of dollars in capital from investors to further its purported mission," the company wrote. "Now, OpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains." In late January, a group of 25 charities, including one started by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, piled on. The coalition urged Bonta "to take prompt legal action to ensure that OpenAI's assets are not illegally diverted for private gain." Rose Chan Loui, a law professor at UCLA specializing in nonprofit and philanthropy law, is skeptical of the legal justifications for OpenAI's plan. She said the proposed changes would amount to a change in purpose for OpenAI's current nonprofit. To do that under Delaware law requires one of four criteria to be met: "We don't think any of those apply here," Chan Loui said. "We keep going back to — your purpose is not to be first in the race to AGI. Your purpose is to make sure that AGI is to protect, and ensure safe development of AGI." OpenAI's existing structure — a nonprofit that controls a for-profit subsidiary — is unusual, but by no means unheard of. The Mozilla Foundation, for example, owns a tech company, Mozilla Corporation, that produces the Firefox internet browser. "Nonprofit organizations can not only coexist with commercial enterprises but also challenge them to do better," a Mozilla spokesperson said in a statement. "Nonprofit commitments provide the kind of public interest compass we don't see enough of in tech." Another parallel comes from the healthcare sector. In the 1990s, in the face of mounting financial pressure, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association allowed its affiliated nonprofit plan organizations to transition to for-profit businesses. Many subsequently did so, to the chagrin of some. "The mission of the nonprofit in most Blue Cross Blue Shield plans was to provide affordable, accessible healthcare to people," a Consumers Union attorney told NPR in 2010. "And now the mission is to make money for stockholders." The most substantial threat to OpenAI's plans though, might not be Musk or other critics. The California and Delaware attorneys general are both making inquiries into the specifics of the transition. "The current beneficiaries of OpenAI have an interest in ensuring that charitable assets are not transferred to private interests without due consideration," Delaware's attorney general, Kathleen Jennings, said. AGs have meaningful legal powers to get involved.

Title: Hedge funds are trimming their Magnificent 7 holdings — here's what they're buying instead

Hedge funds are making some adjustments to their tech-investing playbook. The Magnificent Seven stocks — which include Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — contributed over 50% to the S&P 500's gains last year, but the biggest money managers in the market are increasingly looking to different parts of the market, according to Goldman Sachs' analysis of 695 hedge funds with $3.1 trillion of gross equity positions at the start of the first quarter of 2025. Despite remaining top holdings in Q4 of 2024, all of the Magnificent Seven stocks saw a net decrease in hedge fund ownership except for Tesla. The Magnificent Seven stocks have struggled so far this year. The group's year-to-date return has lagged behind the overall S&P 500 index, with every stock in the Magnificent Seven down in 2025 while the index is up 2.5%. One explanation for the underperformance is that the market is still trying to appropriately quantify DeepSeek's impact. The Magnificent Seven is planning to continue its aggressive AI capex spend for a total of $280 billion in aggregate expenditures, up 34% year over year. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing if those dollars are resulting in tangible results, especially when DeepSeek uses a fraction of the cost. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers, with Meta the only one rising on earnings," Savita Subramanian, head of US equity and quantitative strategy for Bank of America, wrote in a recent note. While the Magnificent Seven stocks are still hedge funds' largest holdings, the funds have increased their exposure to the healthcare and communication services sectors, upping their existing overweights by 135 and 118 basis points, respectively, last quarter, Goldman Sachs said. Healthcare stocks underperformed in 2024, gaining just 2%, but they've had a strong start to 2025, with the sector up 6% year to date. The sector is sensitive to government regulation, so it could be in for some volatility in 2025 if existing healthcare policies change, the bank said. Goldman Sachs identified UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as one of last quarter's "Rising Stars," or stocks with the largest increase in the number of hedge fund investors. In communication services, Walt Disney Company (DIS) was another Rising Star. Hedge funds are still bullish on AI, but instead of only focusing on the Magnificent Seven, they're turning to "Phase 3," or companies with AI-enabled revenues. As the technology develops more use cases, the biggest winners will be the companies that use AI to boost productivity and grow revenue streams. Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) were the top AI Phase 3 stocks among hedge funds last quarter, according to Goldman Sachs. Hedge funds also adjusted holdings last quarter to take advantage of the Trump trade, meaning they moved to cut back on stocks exposed to China and tariffs. Instead, hedge funds added potential deregulation beneficiaries and companies exposed to small businesses and domestic sales. The natural gas processing business Williams Companies (WMB) appeared on the Rising Stars list. While investors are exercising increased caution around the Magnificent Seven and financials, that doesn't mean that hedge funds are jumping ship entirely on those trades: Tesla (TSLA) and Robinhood Markets (HOOD) made the Rising Stars list. Especially within financials, while hedge funds may have cut back on their overall sector allocations, certain individual stocks did well. Hedge funds also believe Stifel Financial Corp (SF) is shaping to be a potential deregulation beneficiary under Trump. Jump to

Microsoft Corporation is the world's largest software manufacturer and one of the largest companies in the world. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) See more on Trefis.com Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has reportedly canceled certain leases for US data center space. This development has prompted questions about the company’s long-term requirements for AI computing capacity. Notably, Microsoft recently reiterated its commitment to an $80 billion capital expenditure plan for the current fiscal year, ending in June, with a signficant portion of that investment directed towards the construction of data centers designed to support AI workloads. MSFT stock declined 1% in a week, and at its current levels of around $400, it looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with MSFT stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MSFT stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Microsoft along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Separately, wondering how IONQ stock may fare post-earnings? Check out – Will The Q4 Results Save IONQ Stock After A 20% Plunge? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MSFT stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. • Microsoft has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11.8 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 26.2 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.5 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Microsoft's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. • Microsoft has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 13.5% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 15.0% from $228 Bil to $262 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 12.3% to $70 Bil in the most recent quarter from $62 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Microsoft's profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Microsoft's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $118 Bil, which represents a considerably high Operating Margin of 45.0% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Microsoft’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $126 Bil, pointing to a considerably high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 48.0% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Microsoft's balance sheet looks strong. • Microsoft's Debt figure was $62 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $3.0 Tril (as of 2/24/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 2.0% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $72 Bil of the $534 Bil in Total Assets for Microsoft. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 13.4%(vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) MSFT stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the last 2 economic downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on MSFT stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Microsoft Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. • MSFT stock fell 28.0% from a high of $180.13 on 10 February 2020 to $129.62 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 8 June 2020 - taking 84 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $464.85 on 7 July 2024 and currently trades at around $400. • During the 2007-09 recession, MSFT stock fell from a peak value of $26.63 on 4 November 2007 to $11.20 on 9 March 2009 a decline of 57.9% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500) • However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 22 August 2013 - taking 1627 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover In summary, Microsoft's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Very Strong • Profitability: Extremely Strong • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that MSFT is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of MSFT stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

February 24, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Feb. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDLX) Class Period: March 14, 2024 - August 7, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) increasing consumer engagement led to an increase in consumer incentives; (2) Cardlytics could not increase its billings commensurate with the increased consumer engagement; (3) as a result, there was a significant risk that its revenue growth would slow or decline; (4) the changes to Cardlytics’ Ads Decision Engine (“ADE”), which led to increased consumer engagement, led to the “underdelivery” of budgets and customers billing estimates; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Cardlytics’ business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Cardlytics class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CDLX Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: November 2, 2022 - December 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. For more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "Modivcare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

Generative AI (GenAI) is set to transform India’s energy sector, driving significant improvements in efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness, according to the EY India report, ‘How much productivity can GenAI unlock in India? The AIdea of India: 2025’. It reveals that 66% of respondents have initiated Proof of Concepts (POCs) for GenAI, with 49% actively exploring AI with allocated budgets. However, only 17% are bullish and investing, while another 17% are in a wait-and-watch mode with small experiments. The survey also highlights that mature enterprises typically allocate 0.4% to 0.7% of their revenues to AI/ML initiatives, achieving an ROI of around 2% of annual revenues. With both ‘Driver’ and ‘Driven’ models of AI adoption emerging, energy companies are leveraging GenAI for predictive maintenance, real-time grid optimization, and personalized customer engagement. In the metals and mining sector, while AI applications have been widely implemented, GenAI has primarily been applied in non-core manufacturing functions to enhance productivity and speed of execution. According to the EY survey, 50% of respondents believe AI has been instrumental in reducing costs. 33% say AI has improved customer satisfaction, while 17% cite benefits for employee satisfaction. The real potential of GenAI lies in amplifying AI’s impact on core operations by leveraging extensive structured and unstructured data.

HEID’s advanced battery technology, combined with Valeo’s compact Powertrain unit, and Atul’s expertise in three-wheeled electric vehicles, will provide a reliable and sustainable solution for urban transport. This initiative is expected to accelerate the adoption of EVs in India, contribute to emission reduction and promote cleaner and greener mobility solutions in the region.

As for ENERGIE SWAP, also a 3-wheeled vehicle, it meets the needs of freight and offers a reliable certified range of 74 km per exchange. The launch of these vehicles in the Cargo and Passenger segments aims to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. With interchangeable battery vehicles, fleet users can expect major benefits such as improved vehicle uptime as batteries can be swapped in few minutes, reduced maintenance costs and a competitive edge in driving towards a greener and more sustainable future.

Hindalco (-3.43%), National Aluminium (-3.13%), Vedanta (-2.70%), JSL (-2.04%) IT Services: 21 IT companies at CG2025: Navigating a slow recovery by Kotak Institutional Equities. CG2025 takeaways: A slow recovery We hosted 21 Indian technology companies for our flagship Chasing Growth 2025 conference. The key takeaways from the conversations with companies are (1) cost optimization continues to be the primary demand driver, (2) the outlook on discretionary spending recovery is mixed, (3) AI will generate significant productivity benefits in services and provide new opportunities and (4) GCC expansion is temporary and a later-stage opportunity. The slower spending recovery and near-term risk from AI adoption lead to downside risks to our revenue growth and margin estimates and stock multiples. We like Infosys and TechM among Tier 1; Coforge, Indegene and LTIM in mid-tier. The weak business momentum leads us to maintain a cautious view on ERD companies despite the ~18-36% decline in stock prices in the past year.

The AIdea of India: 2025’. It reveals that 66% of respondents have initiated Proof of Concepts (POCs) for GenAI, with 49% actively exploring AI with allocated budgets. However, only 17% are bullish and investing, while another 17% are in a wait-and-watch mode with small experiments. The survey also highlights that mature enterprises typically allocate 0.4% to 0.7% of their revenues to AI/ML initiatives, achieving an ROI of around 2% of annual revenues. With both ‘Driver’ and ‘Driven’ models of AI adoption emerging, energy companies are leveraging GenAI for predictive maintenance, real-time grid optimization, and personalized customer engagement. In the metals and mining sector, while AI applications have been widely implemented, GenAI has primarily been applied in non-core manufacturing functions to enhance productivity and speed of execution. According to the EY survey, 50% of respondents believe AI has been instrumental in reducing costs. 33% say AI has improved customer satisfaction, while 17% cite benefits for employee satisfaction.

Hindalco (-3.43%), National Aluminium (-3.13%), Vedanta (-2.70%), JSL (-2.04%) IT Services: 21 IT companies at CG2025: Navigating a slow recovery by Kotak Institutional Equities. CG2025 takeaways: A slow recovery We hosted 21 Indian technology companies for our flagship Chasing Growth 2025 conference. The key takeaways from the conversations with companies are (1) cost optimization continues to be the primary demand driver, (2) the outlook on discretionary spending recovery is mixed, (3) AI will generate significant productivity benefits in services and provide new opportunities and (4) GCC expansion is temporary and a later-stage opportunity. The slower spending recovery and near-term risk from AI adoption lead to downside risks to our revenue growth and margin estimates and stock multiples. We like Infosys and TechM among Tier 1; Coforge, Indegene and LTIM in mid-tier. The weak business momentum leads us to maintain a cautious view on ERD companies despite the ~18-36% decline in stock prices in the past year.

Microsoft terminated select leases with at least two private data center operators across multiple U.S. markets, accounting for “a couple of hundred megawatts” of power, according to a copy of TD Cowen's report as cited by Bloomberg. For a perspective of how much power that is, 1 megawatt can power 250 homes during peak usage hours, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. “While we have yet to get the level of color via our channel checks that we would like into why this is occurring, our initial reaction is that this is tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position,” TD Cowen reportedly wrote. Artificial intelligence depends heavily on massive amounts of data, requiring increased computing power, greater storage, and faster network speeds—all of which data centers provide. However, newer open-source AI models like DeepSeek claim to operate at a fraction of the cost of their American rivals. AI developers may be reassessing where they put their money. An industry source familiar with the matter told Decrypt Microsoft’s pullback reflects a shift in OpenAI workloads toward competitors like Oracle. Oracle, Google, and Meta have all seen significant year-over-year growth in demand, while Amazon’s demand has remained steady. There are currently 3,317 data centers in the U.S. alone, according to figures from tracking website Data Center Map. Addressing questions about shifts in its data center approach, Microsoft reaffirmed its dedication to ongoing growth and infrastructure investments to satisfy rising customer demand. “While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to Decrypt. "This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future.” Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion on “infrastructure” in 2025, the spokesperson said. “Microsoft is adjusting its data center usage targets over the coming years due to increased competition from other players launching new projects,” Blockspace Media co-founder Will Foxley told Decrypt. “Microsoft is still aggressively flexing its budget for data center growth, so I don't take the TD Cowen note as too noteworthy long term.” Foxley, the former Director of Media and Strategy at Compass Mining, noted that such cancellations or adjustments are common for large enterprises. "A company like Microsoft is likely negotiating globally for dozens of data centers simultaneously," he explained. “A few cancellations aren't especially surprising." In contrast, Foxley pointed out that the stakes for canceling data center leases could be significantly higher for Bitcoin miners. “Miners have less capital and operate under tighter timelines,” Foxley said. “That means cancellations can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes.

Title: Novo Nordisk (NVO) Hit with Investor Lawsuit Over CagriSema Obesity Drug – Hagens Berman

February 24, 2025 17:18 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) is embroiled in a class-action lawsuit filed by investors who claim they were misled about the future of its experimental obesity treatment, CagriSema. Hagens Berman urges investors who purchased Novo Nordisk shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge of the trial and its design to contact the firm’s attorneys. Class Period: Nov. 2, 2022 – Dec. 19, 2024Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Mar. 25, 2025 Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/nvo Contact the Firm Now: NVO@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Securities Class Action: The case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey under the title Moon v. Novo Nordisk A/S, No. 25-cv-00713, alleges that the company and its key executives committed securities violations during the Phase 3 trial of CagriSema, known as REDEFINE-1. Investors who acquired Novo Nordisk securities between November 2, 2022, and December 19, 2024, allege that the firm painted an overly optimistic picture of CagriSema’s potential for achieving significant weight loss of at least 25%. According to the plaintiffs, Novo Nordisk relied on questionable data while glossing over issues with dosage tolerability. Central to the lawsuit is the claim that the company’s “optimistic forecasts” about CagriSema’s effectiveness were unfounded. The suit also contends that the study’s “flexible protocol,” which allowed patients to adjust their dosage, compromised the trial's ability to assess weight loss at the tested dosage accurately. This, the plaintiffs suggest, implies either unexpected tolerability issues that led patients to reduce their doses or a rushed patient selection process that included those not targeting the 25% weight loss goal. The complaint points to Novo Nordisk’s December 20, 2024, announcement of REDEFINE-1's preliminary results. The disclosure indicated that the trial used a flexible dosing protocol and revealed that, after 68 weeks, only 57.3% of CagriSema patients were on the highest dose, compared to 82.5% for cagrilintide and 70.2% for semaglutide, the comparator drugs. Following the announcement, Novo Nordisk's stock price plunged nearly 18%, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue that this drop highlights the impact of the alleged misrepresentations on investors. Hagens Berman is investigating investors’ claims. “We are thoroughly investigating these allegations to determine whether Novo Nordisk intentionally misrepresented trial details and masked significant issues with the drug's tolerability,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

These five stocks represent compelling investment opportunities for March 2025, offering a mix of ... [+] growth potential, competitive advantages, and strong fundamentals. In today's market environment, finding the right stocks requires careful analysis of company fundamentals and broader economic trends. With inflation showing signs of cooling and the Federal Reserve hinting at potential rate cuts later this year, certain sectors are particularly well-positioned for growth. This article examines five compelling stock picks that offer strong potential for capital appreciation and steady returns. These selections come from diverse sectors, including technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary, providing investors with opportunities for portfolio diversification. Each company demonstrates solid fundamentals, strong market positioning, and compelling growth catalysts, making them attractive investment options for March 2025 and beyond. This selection process focused on companies with strong fundamentals, sustainable competitive advantages and clear growth catalysts. I evaluated each stock using a comprehensive framework that considered financial metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on equity, as well as qualitative factors, including market position, management quality and industry trends. Special attention was paid to companies with proven track records of navigating economic uncertainties while maintaining strong balance sheets. Additionally, I considered current market conditions and sector-specific trends that could impact performance over the next 12-24 months. Each company was assessed for its valuation relative to peers and historical averages, ensuring that our picks offer reasonable entry points for investors despite the market's recent gains. Microsoft continues to dominate the enterprise software market while making significant strides in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company's Azure cloud platform has become a cornerstone of its business, consistently gaining market share against competitors. Microsoft's strategic acquisition of Activision Blizzard and its partnership with OpenAI has further strengthened its position in gaming and AI technologies, creating multiple growth vectors for the future. Microsoft's compelling investment case rests on its exceptional market position across multiple high-growth segments and its proven ability to monetize new technologies. The company's AI integration across its product suite, particularly in Microsoft 365 and Azure, has created significant competitive advantages and new revenue streams. With enterprise IT spending expected to remain robust and the continued shift toward cloud computing, Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory. Furthermore, with nearly one billion dollars in cash and liquid assets (MSFT 10K), Microsoft's strong balance sheet provides ample resources for continued innovation and strategic acquisitions. The company's consistent dividend growth and share buyback program offer additional value to shareholders, making it an attractive option for growth and income investors. UnitedHealth Group is the largest healthcare company by revenue globally, operating through two platforms: UnitedHealthcare (health insurance) and Optum (healthcare services). The company's integrated approach to healthcare delivery and technology-driven solutions has created a powerful competitive moat. Its Optum division continues to drive innovation in healthcare delivery while expanding margins. UnitedHealth's combination of scale, technological innovation and vertical integration makes it uniquely positioned to benefit from healthcare sector growth. The company's investments in artificial intelligence and data analytics are improving operational efficiency and patient outcomes while reducing costs. The aging U.S. population and increasing healthcare spending provide strong secular tailwinds for continued growth. The drop in price after its CEO was assassinated brought the company down to a more attractive level. The company's consistent execution and strong financial performance, evidenced by nearly double-digit consecutive quarters of earnings beats, demonstrate management's ability to navigate complex healthcare regulations while maintaining profitability. UnitedHealth's dividend growth history and reasonable payout ratio suggest room for continued dividend increases. This stock looks even more attractive after its 12% drop on February 21, following the U.S. Department of Justice's announcement of a civil fraud probe into the company’s Medicare billing. I believe this lawsuit does not significantly threaten the company’s long-term prospects. The market may be reacting out of fear, especially with the upcoming trial of Luigi Mangione, the suspected murderer of UNH’s CEO, which could be casting a negative spotlight on the company. I suggest waiting for a slightly more significant pullback and buying at $435 per share. Mastercard's global payment network continues benefiting from the shift toward digital payments and e-commerce. The company's technology processes billions of transactions annually across more than 210 countries and territories. Beyond its core payment processing business, Mastercard has successfully expanded into value-added services, including cybersecurity, data analytics, and consulting, creating additional revenue streams and strengthening its relationships with financial institutions. Mastercard's investment appeal lies in its powerful network effects, high margins and exposure to global digital payment trends. The company's asset-light business model generates significant free cash flow, allowing for continued investment in technology and strategic acquisitions. Its expansion into emerging markets and new payment technologies, including blockchain and real-time payments, positions it well for future growth. Recent partnerships with fintech companies and investments in open banking capabilities demonstrate Mastercard's commitment to innovation and market expansion. With global digital payment volumes expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% through 2027, Mastercard is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growth. Eli Lilly has emerged as a leader in innovative therapeutics, particularly in diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease treatments. The company's GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, creating a massive market opportunity. Additionally, its Alzheimer's drug donanemab has shown promising results in clinical trials. Eli Lilly's strong position in the rapidly growing weight loss drug market represents a significant growth driver. Market estimates suggest the obesity market could reach $100 billion by 2030, with Eli Lilly positioned to capture a substantial share. The company's robust pipeline, including potential breakthrough treatments for Alzheimer's and cancer, provides multiple pathways for future growth. The company's consistent investment in R&D, strong patent protection for key drugs, and proven ability to bring innovative treatments to market make it an attractive long-term investment. With healthcare spending expected to grow globally, Eli Lilly's focus on chronic diseases and unmet medical needs positions it well for sustained growth. Costco's membership-based warehouse club model demonstrates remarkable resilience and growth potential. The company's focus on providing high-quality products at competitive prices has created strong customer loyalty, evidenced by its industry-leading membership renewal rates of over 90%. Costco's expansion into e-commerce and international markets provides additional growth opportunities while maintaining its core value proposition. Costco's competitive advantages stem from its efficient operations, strong purchasing power, and loyal customer base. The company's membership model provides predictable recurring revenue, while its reputation for quality and value helps it maintain market share even during economic downturns. Recent investments in digital capabilities and supply chain optimization have improved operational efficiency and customer experience. The company's international expansion plans, particularly in China and other Asian markets, offer significant growth potential. With 29 new warehouse openings planned for fiscal 2025 and continued growth in e-commerce sales, Costco is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory while returning value to shareholders through regular dividends and special dividend payments. Bottom Line These five stocks represent compelling investment opportunities for March 2025, offering a mix of growth potential, competitive advantages, and strong fundamentals. While Microsoft and Mastercard provide exposure to digital transformation and financial technology trends, UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly offer stakes in healthcare innovation and demographic trends. Costco rounds out the selection with its defensive characteristics and steady growth potential. When making investment decisions, investors should always consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and portfolio diversification.

Title: Nvidia investors' call gives the chip giant a chance to tell backers why they're wrong about DeepSeek's impact
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/deepseek-impact-nvidia-investors-call-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-24T20:55:44Z
Full Content:
When Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday, the chip giant will have the chance to tell investors why it thinks their intense reaction to the rise of DeepSeek was a mistake — or change the subject entirely. Heading into 2025, Nvidia's rule looked unassailable as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and others lined up for its chips. Then the Chinese startup DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model with benchmark results to rival OpenAI's o1 model. Critically, R1 was said to be produced with fewer and less powerful chips than o1. "DeepSeek's remarkable feat has shaken the industry's assumptions about how much capital or GPU chips a company needs to stay ahead of the competition," Barclays analysts wrote last month. Though Nvidia has largely recovered from markets' reaction to DeepSeek — the chip firm lost $600 billion in market capitalization in one day, in the biggest single drop in US market history — CEO Jensen Huang will need to show investors that the party is nowhere near over and that the promise of AI isn't overhyped. Huang previewed his argument at a virtual event broadcast Thursday, where he said investors had misinterpreted the signals of DeepSeek. As Nvidia prepares to address investors officially for the first time since the DeepSeek saga, here's what to look out for in its earnings. Analysts predict that Nvidia's revenue, especially in its all-important data center business, will keep rising — bolstered by coming data center buildouts. Nvidia's customers are still lining up. OpenAI's Stargate project is expected to spend up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in the US. Meta has forecast an additional $65 billion in spending on data centers this year. And Amazon recently forecast spending $100 billion on computing power. It will offer Nvidia fresh evidence to present to investors concerned that DeepSeek's claim to use chips more efficiently — a key driver in lowering costs — would hurt demand. "Despite DeepSeek's supposed 'revolutionary' optimizations, there is no change thus far to spending intentions at NVDA large customers including Microsoft and Meta," the Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to investors in early February. Model improvements are another favorable piece of evidence for Nvidia. Grok 3, xAI's latest model, has received praise for its performance. Musk's firms also recently collaborated on a second data center with roughly 12,000 Nvidia GPUs, Business Insider exclusively reported. Musk has been aggressively adding to the fleet of GPU-packed data centers supporting Grok, suggesting a link between progress and infrastructure. Morgan Stanley analysts told investors in a note last week that model builders and hyperscalers still had their eyes on artificial general intelligence and that cheaper, highly functional models like DeepSeek wouldn't affect that pursuit. Nvidia's latest and most powerful chip series, Blackwell, has struggled with a slow rollout due to manufacturing and overheating issues. Analysts, however, are expecting the company to report a strong ramp-up. "Demand for Blackwell is very strong and will outstrip supply for several quarters," Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus, said in an investor note last week. UBS's Timothy Arcuri wrote that after much consternation, investor fears of a botched rollout were relaxing, and strong sales numbers could put them fully at ease. UBS analysts also said the fourth quarter was the last in which Blackwell chips wouldn't make up the majority of Nvidia's GPU sales. Investors are likely to favor that shift because Blackwell brings with it higher profit margins. Nvidia's buzzy GTC conference is set to take place in San Jose, California, next month, marking the first anniversary of Blackwell's debut. Further growth in inference demand would also be a point for Huang's theory of investor error surrounding the DeepSeek rout. Demand for inference, the process of using and improving models once they've been trained, increases when consumers and businesses find value in AI tools. Investors will likely want to see the share of AI workloads continue to shift to inference, which also requires GPUs to run. On the company's latest call, in November, Huang repeatedly said inference across Nvidia's platforms was growing. Growth in the software layers of Nvidia's tech stack would be a good sign, too. This would suggest maturity in AI products and lend strength to a part of its business that's potentially even more difficult to compete with than the chips themselves. "What Nvidia talks about on its long-term moats and its possible deployment on the AI application side probably matters more this time," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Investors will also be looking for any signals from Nvidia about the company's approach to China as President Donald Trump threatens to upend business relations with the country. Just before the end of his term, President Joe Biden initiated new regulations, now in a 120-day comment period, on the export of high-powered chips like Nvidia's GPUs. Many policy analysts expect Trump to allow the rules to take effect, as they align with his "America First" agenda, though Trump hasn't directly addressed them. Trump last month described AI leadership as critical to ensuring "economic and national security." Last month, Trump also threatened to impose tariffs on Taiwan, the home of Nvidia's chip manufacturing partner, TSMC. Tariffs could lead to increased costs for Nvidia. Huang met with the president at the White House last month, but neither party provided details of the discussion. Though Nvidia's share price has recovered much of its DeepSeek-induced losses, the $3 trillion juggernaut faces various headwinds. Huang's job on Wednesday will be to reassure investors that those headwinds will be mild and reaffirm that Nvidia remains fundamental to the AI story. Jump to

Title: Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk Disliked by Most Americans, Survey Shows

Time Published: 2025-02-24T20:03:26Z

Republicans and Democrats are split on how they view Musk, while Americans of all political stripes have an unfavorable view of Meta’s boss Most Americans are not big fans of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, the world’s two richest men, according to new survey data from Pew Research Center. The majority of respondents (54%) said they had an unfavorable view of Musk, including 36% saying they had a “very” unfavorable opinion of him. Musk — who owns X and is the boss of Tesla and SpaceX, among other companies — received a “favorable” vote from 42% of respondents. It is worth noting that Musk’s favorability differs wildly across party lines. Among respondents who said they leaned towards Democrats and left-leaning candidates, 85% of them said they disliked Musk; 73% of Republicans, on the other hand, had a favorable view of him. That does not come as much of a shock, considering Musk spent at least $250 million to help President Trump and other Republicans win elections last November. And Musk has been a key cog in Trump’s second administration, where he is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE; Musk said last week he is aiming to trim at least $1 trillion in annual spending from the federal bureaucracy. The Meta CEO, meanwhile, is even more disliked than Musk, with 67% of Americans saying they have an unfavorable view of Zuckerberg. That distaste is shared among Democrats and Republicans, with 76% of left-leaning respondents saying they have an unfavorable view of Zuckerberg, and 60% of right-leaning respondents saying the same thing. Zuckerberg has had a notoriously up-and-down relationship with President Trump, whom he banned from Instagram and Facebook in early 2021, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. At the time, Zuckerberg said “the risks” of keeping him on the platforms were “simply too great.” Trump was later reinstated to those platforms in 2023. More recently, Zuckerberg has had a better rapport with the president. He donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and he was there in Washington, D.C. last month, alongside Musk and other tech executives like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google chief Sundar Pichai. Despite that, most Trump fans in D.C. told TheWrap they remained skeptical of Zuckerberg’s sudden embrace of President Trump. Zuckerberg, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Tracker, has a net worth of $241 billion, making him the second richest person in the world. His net worth has received a nice boost recently, thanks to Meta’s stock price jumping 20% since early November. Musk, despite a recent decline for Tesla’s stock price, remains the world’s richest person with a net worth of $385 billion. Pew’s survey was conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2 and included 5,086 respondents.

Title: Alibaba Places $52 Billion Price Tag on AI Plans
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/alibaba-places-52-billion-price-tag-on-ai-plans/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T19:50:22Z
Full Content:
Last week, Chinese tech conglomerate Alibaba announced a major uptick in AI spending. Now, the company has put a price tag on the effort, according to a Monday (Feb. 24) report by Reuters: at least 380 billion yuan, or $52.44 billion, over a three-year period. During an earnings call last week, the company said it would spend more on artificial intelligence (AI) in the next three years than it has in the last 10, without providing an exact figure. The goal, management said, is to help Alibaba pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI), or a version of AI that can think and reason at or above the level of humans. “We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence. Why is that the primary aim?” Eddie Wu, the company’s CEO, said during the earnings call. “Well, it’s because all of the visible AI application scenarios today that we see around content creation, search and so on and so forth have arisen precisely as a result of the ongoing extension of those boundaries, and we want to keep pushing out those boundaries to create more and more opportunities.” As PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, developing AGI has become a goal for most of the world’s biggest tech players such as OpenAI, Google and Meta. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman “fanned the flames” — as that report put it — at the beginning of the year when he wrote on his blog that the company is “now confident we know how to build AGI” as the technology has been traditionally recognized. “Achieving AGI would have big implications for business. For example, one AI system can analyze market trends while simultaneously redesigning the supply chain to adapt to those changes,” PYMNTS wrote. “It can handle customer service while using those interactions to inform product development. It can manage operations while developing innovative solutions to efficiency problems. It can make strategic decisions by synthesizing information across multiple industries and domains, which requires high-level general reasoning.” The Reuters report notes that Alibaba has begun 2025 as “a winner in China’s AI race,” attracting investors with its business deals, and seeing its stock climb more than 68% this year. Perhaps the company’s most high-profile deal is the one it recently inked with Apple, to help that company develop an AI-powered iPhone for sale in China. Restrictions by the Chinese government require companies to have a local partner before launching AI products. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Title: What is Jeff Bezos' net worth?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week The Amazon tycoon and third richest person in the world made his fortune pioneering online retail Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is one of the most recognizable members of an uber-wealthy global elite. As the owner of the Washington Post since 2013, he is also a frequent target of critics on both sides of the American political divide. Like many of the world's most fabulously wealthy, Bezos' path to riches was greased with family wealth — but it was Bezos' vision that turned an online hub for used books in the early internet era into a world-best market hegemony powerful enough to muscle out competition in virtually any field over the course of 30 years. In large part because Amazon delivery trucks are a ubiquitous presence on America's streets, Bezos has since accumulated enough wealth to be richer than many of the world's countries. Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in computer science and electrical engineering. After college, Bezos went to work for a financial technology startup, Fitel, before moving to banking and then to the hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co. in 1990, where he was "tasked with researching potential business opportunities involving the then brand-new internet landscape," said CNBC. There, he would show "many of the idiosyncratic qualities his employees would later observe at Amazon," including "constantly recording ideas in a notebook he carried with him," said Brad Stone in an excerpt from his 2013 book "The Everything Store."

Bezos and his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, left the hedge fund to start the organization that would become Amazon in 1994, initially operating it out of a Seattle garage. Originally called "Cadabra," the name "later changed because it sounded too much like "cadaver," or a dead human body used for research," said Yahoo. Amazon.com was launched in 1995 as an online bookseller and a year later it was considered one of the "well-established internet shops" pressuring brick-and-mortar retailers like Barnes and Noble as well as smaller, independent bookstores, said The New York Times in 1996. Amazon "survived early prophecies of doom" and eventually "branched out into selling music, movies, electronics and toys during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s." The company struggled through, but ultimately survived, the e-commerce crash of the early 2000s. Bezos took the firm public in 1997, and due to a rapid increase in the company's value, he "appeared on Forbes list of America's 400 wealthiest people for the first time in 1998," said Yahoo Finance, with an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion at the time. He would never again fall out of the exclusive billionaire club. Yet Amazon itself would not develop into the market-dominating behemoth it is today until much later. As late as 2004, it was "still mostly selling just books and DVDs," even as it was "under siege from multiple sides" including retailers like Best Buy, said Vox. That is when Bezos' firm launched the company's Prime subscription service, a "$79-a-year loyalty program that includes free two-day shipping on any order," said CNN. The yearly subscription fee kept shoppers in the Amazon universe, and eventually made making purchases on the site so easy as to be near-seamless. Today, "75% of Americans now use Amazon Prime, a record level of penetration," said Business Insider. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and the billionaire space race What is Donald Trump's net worth? Is the US becoming an oligarchy? Over the years, Amazon continued to add innovative new products that disrupted existing industries, including the Kindle, a digital reader that "dominated every corner of the ebook industry" and today "might as well be synonymous with ebook, with its massive reach that accounts for 68% of overall" market for electronic book sales, said Book Riot. But it is Amazon's dominance of the global package shipping market, driven by Prime subscribers, that has made Bezos one of the richest people in history. Bezos "built the sprawling logistics and delivery empire" necessary "for many of us to buy almost anything we want with a click," said Vox. The company's labor practices and market dominance have been the target of regulatory investigations. Conditions in the company's warehouses have also drawn "scrutiny from government officials, labor groups and workers over high injury rates for the past several years," said The Guardian. Perhaps not coincidentally, in 2024 Amazon argued in a legal filing "that the "National Labor Relations Board was unconstitutional," said The New York Times. Amazon's global network of warehouses, fulfillment centers and delivery services "is the envy of, and inspiration for, Amazon's business partners and competitors," said Vox. Amazon is also one of the largest private employers in the country and in February 2025 "dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever," said CNBC. Amazon's market cap is an astonishing $2.36 trillion, according to Forbes. As his Amazon empire grew larger and larger, Bezos became involved with a variety of other ventures. In 2005, he created Bezos Expeditions, a venture capital and investment fund "through which he owns stakes in many companies including space-transportation startup Blue Origin," said The Wall Street Journal. In 2013, he bought the Washington Post for $250 million in cash, a maneuver which "stunned the media industry and sent shockwaves around Washington D.C.," said Politico. Bezos promised staff "that his ownership would bring no radical change to the paper's core values." In 2017, after Donald Trump's first presidential victory, Bezos added "Democracy Dies in Darkness," a "dramatic and alliterative phrase," beneath the paper's digital masthead, said the Post. The paper "lost $77 million" in 2023 and has "seen a dramatic 50% drop in audience since the highs of 2020," said CNN. In 2024, Bezos pulled the paper's endorsement of Kamala Harris, triggering an exodus of tens of thousands of subscribers as well as a number of staff. Bezos' net worth took a hit from one of the world's most expensive divorces. In 2019, he and MacKenzie Scott announced that they were splitting. As part of the settlement, "Bezos handed Scott a 4% stake in Amazon, transferring a total of $38 billion in shares into her name," said the Independent. Bezos was, at the time, the world's richest man, and even shaving $38 billion off of his fortune left him with $119 billion. It would not be long before the external shock of a global pandemic helped his fortune recover. The Covid-19 pandemic "disproportionately padded the wealth of the richest," including Bezos, said The Guardian. As the demand for delivery services skyrocketed during the acute phase of the pandemic, Amazon's value soared, as did Bezos' net worth. Amazon's stock price went from just under $91 a share on February 28, 2020 to more than $173 a share in mid-October of 2020. Bezos' net worth jumped to more than $200 billion in 2021 but marginally declined to $196 billion by March 2024, said Yahoo Finance. That still made him the second-richest person in the world. Forbes, on the other hand, pegs his net worth at $233.1 billion as of February 21, 2025, which ranks him third on the list of the world's wealthiest people, with Meta's Mark Zuckerberg taking second place.

By Lambert Strether. Bird Song of the Day American Robin, Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge; Deadman Lake. Alaska, United States. Readers, I’m going to close out with the American Robin, because it’s always such a lift to the spirits to hear them burbling after a rainstorm. So, robins until Friday. –lambert * * * In Case You Might Miss… Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Administration “One Word Describes Trump” [The Atlantic]. “Weber wondered how the leaders of states derive legitimacy, the claim to rule rightfully. He thought it boiled down to two choices. One is rational legal bureaucracy (or “bureaucratic proceduralism”), a system in which legitimacy is bestowed by institutions following certain rules and norms. That is the American system we all took for granted until January 20. Presidents, federal officials, and military inductees swear an oath to the Constitution, not to a person. The other source of legitimacy is more ancient, more common, and more intuitive—’the default form of rule in the premodern world’ [Stephen E. Hanson, a government professor at the College of William & Mary, and Jeffrey S. Kopstein, a political scientist at UC Irvine] write. ‘The state was little more than the extended ‘household’ of the ruler; it did not exist as a separate entity.’ Weber called this system ‘patrimonialism’ because rulers claimed to be the symbolic father of the people—the state’s personification and protector…. In his day, Weber thought that patrimonialism was on its way to history’s scrap heap. Its personalized style of rule was too inexpert and capricious to manage the complex economies and military machines that, after Bismarck, became the hallmarks of modern statehood. Unfortunately, he was wrong. Patrimonialism is less a form of government than a style of governing. It is not defined by institutions or rules; rather, it can infect all forms of government by replacing impersonal, formal lines of authority with personalized, informal ones. Based on individual loyalty and connections, and on rewarding friends and punishing enemies (real or perceived), it can be found not just in states but also among tribes, street gangs, and criminal organizations. In its governmental guise, patrimonialism is distinguished by running the state as if it were the leader’s personal property or family business.” • Hmm. Patrimonialism seems akin to the Schmittian friend/enemy distinction. DOGE Elon out over his skis: “Email starts power clash between Musk and agency leaders — even the Trump loyalists” [Politico]. “Elon Musk’s weekend threat to federal workers triggered panic and confusion Sunday as administration officials rushed to issue sometimes conflicting guidance, setting in motion a power struggle between Musk and agency heads appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the federal government. The guidance varied by agency…. It’s the latest episode of Musk’s ‘move fast and break things’ philosophy clashing with the layers of rules and laws that fortify the bureaucracy he hopes to hobble. And it’s the first sign that even staunch Trump loyalists are beginning to flex their political muscle against Musk, an unelected ‘special government employee,’ whose power stems primarily from his proximity to the president.” • Hmm. Here is the letter: I have seen three explanations for this letter, besides sheer harassment (most employees I know of work in a chain of command; they certainly don’t need to report to Elon). (1) The letters will be fed into an AI, and keywords found will be used for firing; (2) the letters are a sorting device for stupid or loyal people, a la the Nigerian 419 fraud; (3) based on the request for that the worker’s managed be cc’ed, results would enable a more accurate, granular org chart of the Federal government to be constructed. “OPM’s Own Guidance Says Fed Employees Never Have to Respond to the Elon Emails” [Talking Points Memo]. “Notwithstanding that what amounts to a prank email has had the entire federal government debating with itself over the last 48 hours, Musk’s own Office of Personnel Management says that federal employees never have to respond to any of these emails. After landing at the Office of Personnel Management in January, DOGE operatives first order of business was to set up a new email system through which all federal employees could be emailed through a single distribution list. They built it on a new server system outside of the established government email system. But emails it sends come to civil servants from the email address HR at OPM dot gov. This new system was given the name Government-Wide Email System (GWES). On February 5th, 2025 — in other words, well after the Trump and more specifically Musk was in charge of OPM — OPM published this document, Privacy Impact Assessement for GWES. As you can see here, most specifically in sections 4.2 and 4.3, federal government employees are never obligated to respond to any GWES emails and are under no obligation to share any information. Indeed, section 4.3 says that to mitigate the risk that the federal employees may not realize this, every GWES email should ‘explicitly stat[e] that the response is voluntary.'” • BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!! Here are a few of the better “five bullets” letters, culled from the Intertubes: Here's one creative way @SecretService managers told agents to respond to Elon Musk's surprise email demanding hat fed employees list their 5 accomplishments last week. Sources said it was designed to avoid agents sharing sensitive and classified details of their work protecting… pic.twitter.com/3dSx9n0ayi — Carol Leonnig (@CarolLeonnig) February 23, 2025 And: I’m going to need five bullets on what you did this past week by morning. pic.twitter.com/SFR3bkU3Hg — Katie Mehnert (@katiemehnert) February 24, 2025 And (NSFW): pic.twitter.com/1YNJMXkizS — Josh Ellis (@jzellis) February 24, 2025 * * * “How Trump’s government-cutting moves risk exposing the CIA’s secrets” [CNN]. “The CIA is conducting a formal review to assess any potential damage from an unclassified email sent to the White House in early February that identified for possible layoffs some officers by first name and last initial and could’ve exposed the roles of people working undercover, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. That’s just one of multiple aftershocks from President Donald Trump’s push to take a jackhammer to the federal government – including the CIA. The administration’s efforts to cut the workforce and audit spending at the CIA and elsewhere threaten to jeopardize some of the government’s most sensitive work, current and former US officials familiar with internal deliberations say. And on the CIA’s 7th floor — home to top leadership — some officers are also quietly discussing how mass firings and the buyouts already offered to staff risk creating a group of disgruntled former employees who might be motivated to take what they know to a foreign intelligence service. Taken together, those actions highlight the depth of unease among career officials that Trump’s efforts to speedily slim down the US government may be putting American secrets within the grasp of foreign spies and hackers.” • So far, Trump — except for slapping those “50 intelligence officials” around for election interference — has left the spooks alone (presumably the generation of spook-related cover stories formerly undertaken by USAID will be moved to State). So is this story a message? A warning shot? What? “Despite the hype, DOGE hasn’t found a shred of fraud” [Public Notice]. “DOGE has claimed it’s rooted out $55 billion worth of spending, a dollar amount that appears to be wildly inaccurate: As of Sunday, DOGE’s website claims it has saved or cancelled $55 billion worth of government contracts. But that same website only accounts for $16 billion in contracts. Half of that comes from an $8 million government contract that DOGE incorrectly identified as being worth $8 billion. Additionally, DOGE has been in some cases simply cancelling contracts that the government has already paid for. Some $325 million in supposed savings are simply contracts that have been repeated in DOGE’s reporting, Politico found. But actual fraud? DOGE has found nothing. None of this has stopped Trump, Musk, congressional Republicans, and their allies in rightwing media from breathlessly highlighting millions of dollars’ worth of spending as examples of fraudulent government programs. Nowhere in those lists of programs — like the USAID initiatives that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been lambasting for weeks, including the tortured and incorrect claim that US taxpayers funded ‘condoms for Gaza’ — is anything that even Musk or Trump themselves have identified as ‘fraud.’ Instead, the goalposts for DOGE have silently moved from finding fraud and corruption to simply pointing out and cancelling government programs that Trump and Republicans simply don’t support.” • I kinda turned off following the detail on this story after Musk went all “Ghost of COBOL” on Social Security…. Democrats en déshabillé “AI video of Trump kissing Musk’s feet plays on TVs in HUD building” [The Register]. “A video produced using artificial intelligence (AI) showing President Trump rubbing and kissing Elon Musk’s feet played on television screens in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) building Monday in an apparent mocking of the relationship between the two men. The words ‘Long live the real king’ were displayed over the top of the computer-generated video, a reference to Trump’s Truth Social post last week in which he wrote, ‘Long Live the King!’ The Hill obtained a photo of the screens in the HUD building as the video was playing.” • Here’s the video: On Monday morning, TV sets at the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development played the seemingly AI-generated video on loop, along with the words “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING.” Read the full article: https://t.co/TYHyCUUqvV pic.twitter.com/dHRjnmVes6 — WIRED (@WIRED) February 24, 2025 I fail to understand the extraordinary hold this trope has on the liberal Democrat mind; it began, or at least was normalized, in a series in The New York Times back in 2018. Liberals seem to believe that the trope is an enormous “own” of conservatives. In fact, it shows that for liberalism — hold onto your hats, here, folks — tribalism trumps principle. In what other context would the “In this house….” rainbow-flag crowd treat gay lovers as anything other than worthy of praise, indeed emulation? But bring in a demon figure, and the deep triggers go off…. “Angry Democratic donors turn off the flow of money” [The Hill]. “Democratic donors — from bundlers to small dollar donors — say they are still angry about the election results and uninspired by anything their side has put forward since then. ‘I’ll be blunt here: The Democratic Party is f‑‑‑ing terrible. Plain and simple,’ one major Democratic donor said. ‘In fact, it doesn’t get much worse.’ A second donor was equally as pointed. ‘They want us to spend money, and for what? For no message, no organization, no forward thinking. … The thing that’s clear to a lot of us is that the party never really learned its lesson in 2016. They worked off the same playbook and the same ineffective strategies and to what end?'” • The party did great in 2016 and 2020. They crippled the left, and that’s their main goal as a party, right? Stop whining, donors! You never had it so good! “Carville suggests Trump admin will ‘collapse’ within 30 days” [The Hill]. “Democratic strategist James Carville suggested the Trump administration will ‘collapse’ within 30 days as the public reacts to the sweeping actions from the executive branch. ‘I believe that this administration, in less than 30 days, is in the midst of a massive collapse and particularly a collapse in public opinion,’ Carville said during a conversation with Mediaite’s Dan Abrams about the Trump administration’s unprecedented recent actions. Abrams asked Carville to clarify what he meant, to confirm that Carville believes the administration will crumble shortly. ‘It’s collapsing right now. We’re in the midst of a collapse,’ Carville replied. ‘This is the lowest approval, not even close, that any president has ever had at a comparable time.'” • This is cope. Not buying it. And if I did, it would be bad: The Democrats must suffer much, much more before there is any change, inside or outside the party. Republican Funhouse Maybe: Voters are mostly liking what they see in the first month of the new presidency. By 57/43 voters say Trump doing a better job than Biden in advance look at poll coming out Monday. Job approval at 52 but closing the border, cutting waste are hugely popular. So is resetting merit… — Mark Penn (@Mark_Penn) February 23, 2025 I’d certainly give the Trump administration more than Carville’s thirty days, though. Realignment and Legitimacy “Monopoly Round-Up: The Populist Revolt Against Oligarchy Begins” [Matt Stoller, BIG]. why choose to focus on Bernie Sanders giving speeches on how he doesn’t like the superrich? I mean, yawn. Right? But something about this campaign is different. It’s not so much what Bernie is saying, it’s that he is doing it to overflow crowds in Nebraska and Iowa. And it’s not just event crowds, his videos are getting tens of millions of views, and his online campaign metrics are performing remarkably well. I got a note from a contact in Bernie-world, who told me that ‘The level of engagement is higher than the last presidential.’ Democratic operatives who have traditionally disliked Bernie are noting what he’s doing, approvingly. Even billionaire Mark Cuban, who hates populism, is calling Bernie’s approach ‘really smart.’ …. This anti-big business vibe isn’t necessarily channeling itself through the Democrats, who are deeply loathed and distrusted…. What’s important about what Bernie is doing, and these other signals, is he might be showing that fear of oligarchy is the dominant view of a large swath of the public. If that’s the case, a lot of things could change, and quicker than we might imagine.” • (Readers; Please keep the Bernie grousing to a minimum. We know all those points by heart.) What I want to know is why Sanders is the only one at the podium. Let’s get some new faces up there!

Measles “Former FDA chief ‘very concerned’ about Texas measles outbreak spreading” [The Hill]. “Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said he is ‘very concerned’ about the measles outbreak in Texas spreading…. He noted that he believes it ‘will spread.’ ‘There’s been 100 cases that have been identified so far,’ Gottlieb said. ‘There’s probably many more than that. ‘So, I think that this is going to get into the hundreds of cases and could take many months to try to fully snuff out,’ he added. The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed at least 90 cases of measles and said 16 patients were hospitalized. Just five of the patients were vaccinated…. Gottleib also noted that there could be economic impacts from the spread of measles, as other countries could place the U.S. under a travel advisory. ‘The risk to the United States right now is that a virus that has been largely extinguished from circulation in the U.S. could return and just continue to spread, even at a low level,’ Gottlieb said.” Treatment: Covid “Demographic Variation In US Outpatient Hydroxychloroquine And Ivermectin Use During The COVID-19 Pandemic” [RAND]. “Using insurance claims from the MedInsight Emerging Experience Research Database for 8.1 million patients from all fifty US states, we evaluated COVID-19-associated outpatient hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin use and spending throughout the public health emergency (January 30, 2020-May 11, 2023) versus pre-public health emergency rates. …. The combined overall hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin utilization rate was threefold higher in older versus younger adults. Ivermectin use was greater among patients with the highest versus the lowest degree of social vulnerability and in the southern US versus other regions.” Origins Debate “What sparked the COVID pandemic? Mounting evidence points to raccoon dogs” [Nature]. • Readers know I take the strong form position that any argument from the structure of SARS-CoV-2 to a claim of human-made creation is the Watchmaker Analogy, beloved of creationists, and to be rejected by Darwinians. That said, for Nature to be recycling the “authorities” who have been on this topic since before the beginning (e.g. Andersen, Pekar, Rasmussen, Worobey) just isn’t a good look. If indeed Nature wishes to “depoliticize” this issue, they should broaden their sourcing.

The calls come after an incident in 2021 where the main cargo door of a DHL-operated Boeing 757 converted freighter opened mid-flight. In the incident in question, the aircraft failed to pressurize following a routine departure from DHL’s European hub located at Leipzig-Halle Airport (LEI) in Germany. Although the crew onboard was aware of the pressurization issue, it was only later discovered that the main deck cargo door had failed to latch correctly, leading to its uncommanded opening in flight.” • Since 2021….

At first. Tech: A classic “Smiley’s People” scene, but with a AI slop added: Always worth watching. But take a look: Every day, in every way, AI makes us more stupid. (Sure, there are use cases.

News of the Wired “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” [Cory Doctorow]. Well worth reading in full, but here is the heart of the matter: “HP’s enshittificatory impulses run wild. They hunt relentlessly for ways to make things worse for their customers in order to make things better for themselves. Last week, they came up with a humdinger, even by their own standards. They announced that people who called their customer service line would be subject to mandatory 15-minute waits, even if there was a rep who was free to talk with them…. During this mandatory 15-minute wait, customers would be bombarded with a recorded voice demanding that they solve their problems by consulting HP’s website and its awful chatbots. In a competitive market, businesses can contain their customer service costs by making better products. In a monopolistic market like the printer racket, companies can deliberately introduce maddening antifeatures to their products, and then fob off the customers who reach such a peak of frustrated rage that they resort to calling a customer support number on chatbot that will use its spicy autocomplete to hallucinate nonexistent drivers and imaginary troubleshooting steps…. Within a day of Paul Kunert breaking the story in The Register, HP had reversed its policy, citing ‘feedback’ (a corporate euphemism that means ‘fury’).

He noted that he believes it ‘will spread.’ ‘There’s been 100 cases that have been identified so far,’ Gottlieb said. ‘There’s probably many more than that. ‘So, I think that this is going to get into the hundreds of cases and could take many months to try to fully snuff out,’ he added. The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed at least 90 cases of measles and said 16 patients were hospitalized. Just five of the patients were vaccinated…. Gottleib also noted that there could be economic impacts from the spread of measles, as other countries could place the U.S. under a travel advisory. ‘The risk to the United States right now is that a virus that has been largely extinguished from circulation in the U.S. could return and just continue to spread, even at a low level,’ Gottlieb said.” Treatment: Covid “Demographic Variation In US Outpatient Hydroxychloroquine And Ivermectin Use During The COVID-19 Pandemic” [RAND]. “Using insurance claims from the MedInsight Emerging Experience Research Database for 8.1 million patients from all fifty US states, we evaluated COVID-19-associated outpatient hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin use and spending throughout the public health emergency (January 30, 2020-May 11, 2023) versus pre-public health emergency rates. …. The combined overall hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin utilization rate was threefold higher in older versus younger adults. Ivermectin use was greater among patients with the highest versus the lowest degree of social vulnerability and in the southern US versus other regions.” Origins Debate “What sparked the COVID pandemic? Mounting evidence points to raccoon dogs” [Nature]. • Readers know I take the strong form position that any argument from the structure of SARS-CoV-2 to a claim of human-made creation is the Watchmaker Analogy, beloved of creationists, and to be rejected by Darwinians. That said, for Nature to be recycling the “authorities” who have been on this topic since before the beginning (e.g. Andersen, Pekar, Rasmussen, Worobey) just isn’t a good look. If indeed Nature wishes to “depoliticize” this issue, they should broaden their sourcing.

The calls come after an incident in 2021 where the main cargo door of a DHL-operated Boeing 757 converted freighter opened mid-flight. In the incident in question, the aircraft failed to pressurize following a routine departure from DHL’s European hub located at Leipzig-Halle Airport (LEI) in Germany.

News of the Wired “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” [Cory Doctorow]. Well worth reading in full, but here is the heart of the matter: “HP’s enshittificatory impulses run wild. They hunt relentlessly for ways to make things worse for their customers in order to make things better for themselves. Last week, they came up with a humdinger, even by their own standards. They announced that people who called their customer service line would be subject to mandatory 15-minute waits, even if there was a rep who was free to talk with them…. During this mandatory 15-minute wait, customers would be bombarded with a recorded voice demanding that they solve their problems by consulting HP’s website and its awful chatbots. In a competitive market, businesses can contain their customer service costs by making better products. In a monopolistic market like the printer racket, companies can deliberately introduce maddening antifeatures to their products, and then fob off the customers who reach such a peak of frustrated rage that they resort to calling a customer support number on chatbot that will use its spicy autocomplete to hallucinate nonexistent drivers and imaginary troubleshooting steps…. Within a day of Paul Kunert breaking the story in The Register, HP had reversed its policy, citing ‘feedback’ (a corporate euphemism that means ‘fury’). This is a rare win for the forces of disenhittification and it deserves recognition. It turns out that in these Mangionean times, companies can actually be bullied into comporting themselves with marginally less sleaze and cruelty.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. May you sail into your future on calm seas, with propitious winds and pleasant, sunny days. Thank you, especially for the “propitious winds” part (me being watchful of whatever is airborne).

The Atlantic article and Weber’s patrimonialism is utterly anti-historic. In Mesopotamia, the ruler’s household — the palace economy — was corporately distinct, as were the temples (usually close to the ruler). The economy at large was governed by common law on the land. So it was a bifurcated (or better, trifurcated) economy. The state emerged only in classical antiquity. Not in anthropological societies, where the chieftain’s household also was distinct. Awesome, thanks! It was the Schmittian aspect that appealed to me. Did the friend/enemy distinction appear as the key aspect of politics back in Mesopotamia? I have no notion of how that discourse would have appeared, or even if States in those days conceived of “politics” as we do, so perhaps that is a very stupid question. Schmitt’s theorizing on the friend/enemy distinction appears based on his philosophical decision about human nature not the historical development and evolution of the State. “Because the sphere of the political is in the final analysis determined by the real possibility of enmity, political conceptions and ideas cannot very well start with an anthropological optimism. This would dissolve the possibility of enmity, and thereby, every specific political consequence.” See Carl Schmitt, (The Concept of the Political), pg. 64 That HUD video seems especially stupid, aside from just being dumb – unless all those people were just fired and not worried about use of resources, connecting to 3rd parry tools, if HQ means an area where the public could walk in then public presentation without authorization, etc etc that would get me fired from my private sector job. Who the heck knows why the libs think that deploying gay fetishist images are the way to troll the quote unquote fascists into submission. It’s projection. And infuriating. Thanks for pointing this out. My brain shut off with “disgusting” and refused to delve deeper. ive never understood the foot fetish thing,lol. i mean, to each his own…and Tam’s pinky toes were tiny and bent and cute and all…but man! to reify feet thataway… i wonder at the psychology of it. I never got a boner from feet, myself. democratic culture seems to consist entirely of ad hominem “owns” of republicans. i find it to be deeply frustrating, and exacerbated by the internet. (it’s a lot easier to make fun of people who you don’t actually know, and there are no repercussions, only ingroup praise.) they think it’s funny to “turn the republicans own weapons against them,” when really it’s just one giant bullyish name calling match. a lot of the people i hung out with this weekend spoke of trump and republicans in a really mocking sense. mostly online young women in their 20s. one of them told me about a tiktok trend called “republican makeup” (link for reference) where people put on “foundation that is the wrong color and overlined lips”, while democrat makeup was “like actually good makeup.” which reminded me of the “our blessed nyc clean girl aesthetic vs their barbarous southern beauty queen aesthetic” meme. i am reaching the point where i am just going to ignore everyone who acts like that if i can. because me going “erm thats dumb actually” feels like it’s contributing to the cycle. What is a bit disturbing today is two or three of the screen grabs I have seen from the NSA and what the employees were discussing online in an open forum at the agency. Very inappropriate for work. It is also a bit disgusting to me – not everyone who has had the work they described is happy with the results – there are those in my practice who are in constant misery all day. I am no prude. In my life and my line of work, I have heard it all. But that does not mean this is appropriate to be placed on an open forum at work. Had I done anything like that all the way through my career up into the present day – I would have been terminated immediately. I know that because it has happened several times to others in my life – for far far less than what was done at HUD and what was released from NSA today. The HUD tape and now the NSA forum – the kid last year doing the OnlyFans on Amy Klobuchar’s desk in the Senate committee room…..I can go on and on…… What is wrong with these people? Why do they think this kind of behavior is OK? Here, read some history: Triggering the Libs. I never know if people who only quote one side of the food fight were particularly online in the last yen years, where a lot of this originated. Anyway, I always think about Thomas Frank’s masterpiece, Make Them Cry. Now that people believe that the state is mostly unable to deliver positive outcomes for people, they’ve decided to use virality and state power, if possible, to punish and upset their enemies. I think there may be one big difference – this Dem was so “triggered” by much of what was done in the past 4 years not by random online people but by actual employees and staffers of Dem congresspeople and agencies that it really turned me off to the whole Dem architecture in DC. As in really making me believe they need a break from power. Random online people are not the same as employees and staffers. No, no difference. Why? Those people who started it online on the right are now in power so I think the point stands. The Thiel network is staffed through with groypers and Very Online People, including our VP Vance and most of the DOGE main characters. Elon’s Hitler salute was a classic lib-owning 4-chan bit, even saying that “he is become meme.” Life is now a crummy mirror of the posting wars of the last decade where the group in power gets to punish the others. I don’t think we could honestly look at 2021 and say that Trump world handles COVID substantially better than Biden world, and the fact that we get to live through this farce is heartbreaking. Those online people (groypers and alt right) are now the ones in power, punishing their enemies and privatizing the government so the cycle of Making Them Cry continues. The current application of Making Them Cry is a bright shiny squirrel object to divert attention from the deeper longer-range agenda of bankrupting and largely destroying the US government and selling off every publicly owned asset ( all the National Parks, all the National Wildlife Refuges, all the National Forests, all the BLM lands, all the Taylor Act Grazing lands, all the TVA/BPA/CVA/VA/Social Security/USPS etc. assets), and everything else of monetizable value to the Republicans’ social class allies, social class and personal cronies and masters. And the purpose of terminating government functionality is also to make every upper class crime functionally legal in practice. MAPLA! ( Make All Pollution Legal Again) and so forth. Their eyes are on the prize and Making Us Cry is a ploy on their part to keep us busy and distracted. I read somewhere that that video was not an HUD video . . . . not authored and placed by HUD people . . . but was placed there by an outside hacker. Has anyone else read different? How long did the HUD computer people leave it up there before taking it down? And if Musk’s little dogees locked the HUD people out of their own computers and then an outside hacker got in and put it there, but the HUD people were still locked out, what exactly would the HUD people have been supposed to have been able to do about it? >How long did the HUD computer people leave it up there before taking it down? And if Musk’s little dogees locked the HUD people out of their own computers and then an outside hacker got in and put it there, but the HUD people were still locked out, what exactly would the HUD people have been supposed to have been able to do about it?

It sounds like this particular Democrat is not just rolling over. This particular Democrat is a secret Republican agent and probably a secret Trump and Musk asset of influence. Any individual Democratic officeholder who is an effective and functional part of an actual successful effort to derail and delay and hopefully destroy some part of the TrumpenMusk program would be worth retaining in office. Any individual Democratic officeholder who is not successful ( even if they try or pretend to try) is best quietly and unemotionally abandoned to whatever fate awaits it. Time and attention are scarce and precious, and any time and attention . . . even negative time and attention . . . given to such people is diverted away from achieving something real. Individual Democratic Senators would be easy enough to assess for effectiveness. At the very least, a DemSen could put a Tuberville hold on Bongino for Assistant FBI Director. And keep that Hold locked in place as long as Senate Rules allow. That is just an example of the Obstructionary tools which individual Senators do have at their disposal, without regard to what their ” Minority Leader” might think or want. And if the Republican TrumpenMusk plan is to run the government to fast-forward destruction, then Democratic officeholders could be the ones to shut the government all the way down in March and keep it shut down as long as the TrumpenMusk Republicans want a 4 trillion dollar debt increase to match a 4 trillion dollar tax cut in order to liquidate the Government sooner so as to sell off every public asset of every kind to private buyers. If the Democratic Officeholders do not shut the government down and keep it shut down to the end this Congress if necessary in order to slow the Trump Train down, then they would be best not thought about any more. People would have to try learning to live in a “no-more-National Democrats” world. Re: HP and De-enshittification I love the term “enshittificatory” – ha! I suggest another term – “enshittifigenic” … as in, thanks to private equity and greased AI we live in an enshittifigenic environment. I have to admit in my line of work we spent a lot on HP Test and Measurement equipment. We worked closely with them my whole career (later on it was Agilent Technologies, and then Keysight.) Their people were top notch. The equipment was the gold standard for test, data acquisition, and control. They were a big part of what I consider the old Silicon Valley to be all about – technical competence, world class support, and a minimum of BS. This thing they call HP today – I don’t see any of that anymore. Sad. The American Robin was the first bird I identified as a child. It may be common but is still special. Lambert: Thank you for all your contributions over the years. From articles to links to Water Cooler, I feel so much better informed about what is going on in the world thanks in part to you. Your links and information on Covid was so important at a time of chaos. Thank you, thank you, thank you for writing for Naked Capitalism. You will be missed! Agree with everything you said. Thanks for everything, Lambert! Same here. You will be missed. Agreed! Of all places to locate words of wisdom, in an early movie scene of Scarface you have Frank the cocaine boss providing advice to the young new hire, Tony Montana…” Don’t get high on your supply…”. The more this cost cutting effort goes ahead in an increasingly wild pattern, it looks like Musk is possibly violating this rule and being a bit too high and strong on his very own power sources whatever form they might be… Eventually some department heads just needed to push back, even moderately so. You can’t lead a department amid a mass exodus and mass personnel changes….well you can I suppose; people who somehow stay or stick it out really should maintain some outside recruiting contacts. As I recall there was a data science / IT technical leader who commented on being let go during a previous round of cost cutting, hope they’re finding some green pasture afterwards. Cost cutting…does sound better than wielding the proverbial axe through bureaucracy, but only a moderate improvement. This all looks like mere chaos from the cheap seats. At some point, possibly far sooner than our Boer settler colonialist friend suspects, Trump is going to have to weigh whether the money he’s making thanks to Musk compensates for lost attention and, eventually, pushback from his base and the broader public. Musk has his incel s^*+heel legion, but they could be put down if so desired. Hard to imagine Musk’s competing megalomania and antics not annoying Trump before long. A couple of things about the above articles – the measles article – and the ivermectin/HCQ article. First of all – there are some very interesting standouts as far as deviations from norms in the measles outbreak. The rate of hospitalization is extremely higher than what would be expected – and that is giving me some real concerns. My guess is that this is being spread among people who are not the healthiest to begin with- and that may be driving this. Even more interesting is the constant use of the word “unknown” when referring to the “unvaccinated”. Just so everyone will know, the use of the word “unknown” especially in the numbers it seems to be being used in this issue – is a kind of medical code word that is often specifically used for immigrants. Their vaccination status for pretty much anything is truly unknown and this is especially true after the past 4 years of no-screening wide open borders. All immigrants during the past 4 years were forced to be COVID vaccinated – despite the fact that it is a non-sterilizing vaccine incapable of preventing transmission – all the while their measles status, among others, was never checked nor were they forced to be vaccinated for it. I have had my share of unscreened immigrants in the past 2 years with all kinds of medical infectious disease issues. I have screened every last one of them for many infectious issues including measles. Every last one had negative measles antibodies – meaning they had never been vaccinated. I have vaccinated them all. BUT THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE BORDER. Just think how much more common sense would have been had – if instead of mandating COVID vaccines which do nothing for transmission – vaccines for measles and other things THAT DO MAKE A DIFERENCE would have been mandated. It is called public health 101. My understanding of this, although all rumor and hearsay, is that immigrants were the nidus of this – but then it spread into some kind of non-vaccinating religious community, I think Mennonite – but not sure – and then exploded. Regardless – do yourselves a favor and have your kids and grandkids make sure they had MMR. Furthermore – as an adult – if you were immunized decades ago, you may be surprised that your immunity has worn off. GET CHECKED. I did – and I was found to be “inderminate” for measles immunity – so I was vaccinated again. I immediately turned off the IVM/HCQ article when they said right off the bat it was for insurance claims only….Huh? – They must have slept through the entire pandemic, especially the part where pharmacy chains et al were blacklisting docs and reporting them to boards etc. An overwhelming predominance of my patients that were using it were getting it from veterinary sources and other under the table methods. Insurance claims? Really? If that is the method they were using – it has WAY WAY undercounted the usage. And I can assure you in my world – there was no lower class predominance. The border vaccination policy you describe is shocking. I was recently surprised to learn that a measles infection comes with a bonus: it compromises immunological memory so that one is rendered vulnerable to reinfection by diseases that one would otherwise have protected from by the adaptive immune system. From Wikipedia: The measles virus can deplete previously acquired immune memory by killing cells that make antibodies, and thus weakens the immune system, which can cause deaths from other diseases.[42][43][44] Suppression of the immune system by measles lasts about two years and has been epidemiologically implicated in up to 90% of childhood deaths in third world countries, and historically may have caused rather more deaths in the United States, the UK and Denmark than were directly caused by measles.[94] Although the measles vaccine contains an attenuated strain, it does not deplete immune memory.[43] I made a misstatement in my above discussion – It should say “All LEGAL immigrants were forced to have the COVID vaccine” – it is very clear that in the chaos at the border where the illegal immigrants were concerned – there was no effort to worry about any vaccination. Nidus = “Medicine: a place in which bacteria have multiplied or may multiply; a focus of infection.” Sorry for the jargon – I try my best but it sometimes escapes. And just FYI, medical jargon terms are often not really associated with their underlying meaning. I have been fascinated by the attempts of AI to reproduce this as if it was a real clinician. This is often hilarious to read. A nidus is the source of infection in a body – in epidemiological terms – a nidus is often ironically used to refer to the patient zero type individuals – the source of the epidemic. “Sorry for the jargon ” I think you are beyond splendid, and was only setting down a dictionary meaning. “FYI, medical jargon terms are often not really associated with their underlying meaning. I have been fascinated by the attempts of AI to reproduce this as if it was a real clinician…” https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202502/1328947.shtml February 23, 2025 Local governments, hospitals in China embrace DeepSeek AI helps assisting public service hotline, medical record management By Li Yawei and Liang Rui A growing number of cities in China are embracing the innovative applications of DeepSeek, with some integrating it into government services to streamline repetitive tasks and hospitals leveraging it for preliminary patient diagnostics. A Chinese AI expert noted that DeepSeek serves as an assistant to enhance productivity, yet humans’ comprehensive practical abilities remain beyond DeepSeek’s reach… Nidus. Latin for nest ==> French, le nid. Joining in the etymology-fest: The term “nidicolous” is also used to refer to birds who stay in the nest until grown, and also used to describe other species that mainly occupy nests of other animals, as in “nidicolous mites” or other “nidicoles” that specialize in parasitizing nesting birds and mammals. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DRWK January 15, 2018 Life Expectancy at Birth for China and Mexico, 2000-2022 https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DRWM January 30, 2018 Infant Mortality Rate for China and Mexico, 2000-2022 Thanks Doc. We movie fans know that one of the functions of Ellis Island was to check the health status of immigrants and possibly reject them on that basis. Hence the “island.” Disease management going backwards? And of course during Covid port of entry NYC was one of the origin regions for the USA. Whatever one thinks of Musk our government managers seem to have lots of competence gaps. Shouldn’t they be hiring while they are firing? ” Shouldn’t they be hiring while they are firing”? Only if maintainance of government function while improving it is Musk’s goal. But if Musk’s goal is to destroy these government departments and agencies, then firing should outrun hiring. And Ideally hiring would be zero while doing the firing so as to destroy the targeted departments and agencies soonest. Since that is what Musk is doing, it would appear that ‘ closing competence gaps’ is not the goal here. The NIH says measles immunity from vaccines starts falling after 10-15 years! https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8189124/ Plus the MMR vaccine is a live (attenuated virus) vaccine and those generally strengthen the immune system (I have become a live vaccine fetishist). Where I am, getting a measles titer test costs more than the vaccine (and my insurance does not cover either). I could almost certainly talk my regular MD into Rxing an MMR vaccine again. Is there any reason not to do that (as long as you space it out in relation to other vaccines or interventions)? To put it another way, shouldn’t everyone over 50 assume they need an MMR vaccine again? The word disenshittification is the main thing that’s always irked me about his attempt to enhance his brand with a new word, when crapification has been a perfectly complete, and more sensible, word since the last century. Petty? Perhaps. (Probably.) The backpedalling has begun, but with hints of more mayhem to come: Elon Musk makes an admission about the productivity email his group sent to federal workers Elon Musk said that blanket emails sent to federal employees asking for a response about their weekly accomplishments or risk termination was a test to see if they “had a pulse.” Less than 24 hours before the deadline, Musk hinted that the emails were simply a ruse to ensure federal employees were “capable of responding” to his correspondence. “This was basically a check to see if the employee had a pulse and was capable of replying to an email,” Musk said. “This mess will get sorted out this week. Lot of people in for a rude awakening and strong dose of reality. They don’t get it yet, but they will.” On Sunday afternoon, Musk also referred to the emails as a “very basic pulse check.” That evening, Musk added that a response was indicative that employees have “two working neurons.” I think the degree of future mayhem depends on who/what was behind the backtracking. Musk hates to look a fool, and right now he does in spades. You can tell by his childish response. Since Musk is a significant driver of this stuff, and it is moving faster than any legacy systems or people can keep up, then it becomes up to individuals, along and/or in groups, to figure out how to cause Musk maximal pain so fast as to divert his energy from the great work of dismantling governance. How can millions of people destroy Tesla and force it into quick liquidation all over the world? How many people would have to leave twitterX and/or boycott all its advertisers until they leave it, in order to steer twitterX into a shrinkage spiral and then a death spiral? Thanks. He also sent an email saying the month is up and those not back in offices from work at home would be fired. Presumably another “just kidding” missive? Musk needs a muzzle. Why does Musk need a muzzle? Let Musk be Musk. Let it all hang out. Let people get a good strong whiff of the Musk-man’s true smell. From “a critical care physician and medical director of intensive care units in federal, local and rural hospitals, I am in part a government employee”: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-02-24/doge-office-of-personnel-management-uc-san-diego-veterans-affairs/ The man-children in charge still won’t respect what this doctor does or feel happiness at care brought to patients. They still think AI will do it better. Dealing with certified empathy challenged people who were selected for those traits. It is not just the federal government. This doctor is having many of the same complaints that any doctor in America working for private equity has. Here’s the latest outburst from DOGElon with commentary. https://www.reddit.com/r/1102/comments/1ix0sif/another_tweet_by_musk_about_rto/ Due to office space constraints, many federal agencies have not been able to find space for all of their teleworking and remote work employees, some of whom live thousands of miles from their head quarters. According to Musk, it appears that these individuals will be put on administrative leave and presumably laid off in 60 days. “Bad government is the natural product of rule by those who believe government is bad.” –Thomas Frank I wonder what Elon will do when he realizes that the US Patent and Trademark Office is about 90 percent remote, including almost all patent examiners. Would be tragic if all Tesla (car company) and SpaceX patents were permanently deleted. Irrecoverably lost. Just gone. Not on Google, not anywhere. It could be an organized hack, who knows? Many government workers don’t have offices to go back to because it was management that sent them home. I’ve already read stories about mass layoffs in the US PTO on LinkedIn. Looks like there won’t be as many of them to rubber stamp tech bros patents … Are you sure they’re not talking about new hires who got their start date delayed or people who took the “Fork”? Nothing about a mass layoff https://www.reddit.com/r/patentexaminer/ Lambert – I don’t know if you realize how your postings and curations over these many years have been what seems now as an irreplaceable window into the realities of the world. It’s been really fabulous. If this is actually the last day, it is then a very sad day. May you flourish wherever you are destined! >If this is actually the last day, it is then a very sad day. May you flourish wherever you are destined! Indeed, as grey a day as can be in the Upper Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire if it is a last day. And yes, may you flourish wherever you are destined. Thank you! Friday! I have things to wrap up for this whole week I hope you include Christmas wrapping paper as you are (soon to be were) a wonderful gift. AKA you dah mahn! Lambert, Please make a website and help organize us into Local Third Parties! The Conjurer, A reminder to us not to get caught up focusing on the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Lambert, I am going to miss your ability to see beyond the mirrors, and your dry wit flogging of our betters. Whatever your plans may be, I’m confident they will be executed in style with deserving beneficiaries. Fare you well. ps, robins were my mom’s favorite. Friday! Friday. In a different timeline I would insist on standing you a pint or five. Thanks for everything. It’s been a good run. Is there a place we can go to follow you? Or are you opting out to pursue other adventures? After you have had a good long well-earned rest, I hope you decide to figure out how to overcome your dislike of work when it comes to gardening. If we are approaching a future where ” the food you cannot grow is the food you will not have” . . . then you may well want to protect your future survivability against that future. That’s not an assignment, just a hope and a wish. Cheers, Mazel Tov and Cent Anni to Lambert! >>>What I want to know is why Sanders is the only one at the podium. Let’s get some new faces up there Perhaps he is the designated Judas goat? And despite being almost as supine as most other politicians, he still has more of a spine than most of them? Maybe the “party” feels that Sanders actually had an email list of people who supported him, and thus he should get out there; no one else can even claim to have a popular following. I note that I received not one but two different spam text this past weeks: “Bernie here”. Yeah, sure. I now live in Iowa so maybe it was a way of hyping the rallies in PMC Fooballville (aka Iowa City). I was angry at Sanders after he dropped out in 2020. Now I just feel sorry for him having to carry water for such horrible people, to no apparent purpose, and with no possible benefits. I’ll be missing you weekday afternoons. Along with all of the substantive things Lambert has shared, and all of the substantive comments people will make in farewell, I have been grateful for all of the Clash references. ‘Ignore Alien Orders!’ And Woody Guthrie’s guitar isn’t the only machine capable of killing fascists. Thanks to the team here at NC. It is ok to hear that Sanders has followers. I guess he most people only realistic option to completely selling out. I haven’t seen any positive talk about him anywhere else or encountered any of his supporters on any of the mastodon social media i usually inhabit. I have seen things for Jill Stein, De LA Cruz etc. Lambert, thank you again for all the hard work, sophisticated explanations, and sacrifice you have given to helping knit together this wonderful website! We will miss your daily presence, and hopefully will still enjoy guest returns from time to time. Lambert – thank you for all that you have done. You have not only enlightened people – I think you have done much to save their sanity. To Lambert : Thank you for all your work and all the best in your future endeavors. RE: why Sanders is the only one at the podium Because if actual members of the Democrat party were there too, the “good billionaires” like Pritzker and Soros might have a sad. And we can’t have that lest donations be cut. The spice must flow! Lambert, not sure what you’re remaining schedule is, but thanks for everything over the years! “Your” – it wouldn’t do to allow the typo in my potentially final comment to you in WC to go unremarked. I’ve admired your meticulous grammar over many years! Lambert: masc. proper name, from French, from German Lambert, from Old High German Lambreht, from lant “land” (see land (n.)) + beraht “bright” (from PIE root *bhereg- “to shine; bright, white.”). Plantidotes and John Singer Sargent. Everything begins to make sense. https://youtu.be/lWA2pjMjpBs?si=KzwL4OCH3Io-QY0n Lambert: sharper than any diamond Your last day? Say it ain’t so! You are the very model of a Moderator General, You’ve information vegetable, animal, and mineral, You know the chiefs in Congress, and you quote the fights historical, From Medicare to Labor laws, in order categorical; Paging Edward Gorey, nice one f. Farewell, thou greatest of hamster wranglers Bosch, Smiley, Sparky the raccoon dog…. Gonna miss you Lambert. Thanks so much. Elon’s “five bullets” email debacle. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Yeah, one bullet is all you need when playing Russian Roulette~ Lambert, It’s been fun having you around with your keen sense of chiaroscuro, and a celebration is in order! Happy trails… Thank you for everything, Lambert, and do take care. Happy trails! If you’re ever near Hanover I’d be honored to buy you lunch and a beverage of your choice. Lambert – many will be referencing your files into the future. Take care. Wishing you well, Lambert. I’m an appreciative lurker. You rock! https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/covid-virus-evolution/681798/ COVID Broke the Rules of Virus Evolution “But scientists were not aware of a second, accelerated evolutionary track: When SARS-CoV-2 infects a single immunocompromised patient, it can persist for months, accumulating countless mutations in that time.” I vaguely recall this being discussed on NC early in the outbreak. No? It may have been during those conversations where there seemed to be much amazement at how much previous science about viruses seemed to have went out the window. Maybe a post or two. “And if we are unlucky, that highly mutated virus might spread to others. This is the likely origin of Omicron, which appeared in fall 2021 with more than 50 mutations—an astounding evolutionary leap. ” And the timing of that…brings something else to mind. “COVID Broke the Rules of Virus Evolution” Please set down the science reference, if possible. I can find no journal publication reference. I didn’t write the article. Just looked like they were talking about something scientists weren’t aware of and I’m trying to remember where it seems like I heard that discussed before. “I didn’t write the article.” I am grateful for the mention of the article, but an article about scientific findings should immediately reference those findings. I am in no way challenging the post, but absent journal-published scientific findings I have no way of judging the article. Thank you so much. (Remember…) > That same month, a preprint from a group led by Ravindra Gupta The link at preprint leads to: : Neutralising antibodies in Spike mediated SARS-CoV-2 adaptation I have a long time frustration with The Atlantic’s Covid coverage. i remember something about that, as well…but Toffler’s information overload applies Lambert, I will really miss you, a lot lot! May you find new adventure on the high seas, but always remember to return home… hope we will hear from you around here once in awhile, but if this is really your quiet grand finale, then thank you ever so much Bosch! I’m so happy to see this. So much to unpack in it as always. Thank you Lambert. Tossing this out there. Acknowledging the questionable nature of the analogy, but Musk’s Legions of Decency and Economy could be equated with Ernst Roem’s Brownshirts of the early days of the NASDAP in interwar Germany. Will Trump have to stage his own version of the ‘Night of the Long Knives?’ (After the Muskshirts have done their wrecking chores. What would Kristallnacht look like on the Internet?) In this case, Trump, or his successor, already has an Enabling Act in place, thanks to the spineless Politicos of Washington. The above is not strictly snark Happy trails Lambert. I will miss you. Labor activism. When the enforcers strike, what does that mean? More than 6,500 National Guard personnel on duty as wildcat NY prison strike continues syracuse.com More than 6,500 National Guard personnel were on duty Monday to help run the New York state prison system as an illegal strike by corrections officers entered its second week. … Strikes by government employees are illegal under a section of state Civil Service Law commonly known as the Taylor Law. The current contract with the corrections officers union took effect in 2023 and lasts through next year. The involvement of the National Guard is similar to a two-week strike in 1979 when guard personnel ran prisons with the State Police. “We bullied HP into a minor act of disenshittification” There must be a movement against that kind of thing. It could be called antidisenshittificationism, a new spelling bee word. Anyway wouldn’t the HP action be deshittification? Other: I hadn’t heard about raccoon dogs before. I only knew about wiener dogs. Lambert, OMG just catching up with earlier comments. I’m going to miss you. Make sure to check in with your NC homies here now and then. Bizarre – I’m just noticing now after years, that Gonzalo Lira (the US journalist passed/killed by Ukraine) had a pretty bad dust-up with Steve Keen a decade ago – I had even contacted Steve at the time to let him know of a ‘website malfunction’ caused by the aftermath of this, and learned of Lira’s involvement then (without knowing anything about him then). Weird how short the degrees of separation are – I see he has had stuff cross-posted here at NC at times, as well, ‘back in the day’. Moving to USA as a Brit is bewildering in many ways. Finding out that the American robin is a completely different bird was one. Beautiful :) Re: hanging up the Yellow Waders? But where to hang them? Some artistic placement is needed. Best wishes Lambert! Thanks for all the conversation and links over the years. I hope your next endeavor is everything you want it to be. Re the “patrimonialism” piece, the thing to note is that the Weberian state was always an ideal, not ever a real thing, even if we came closer to it every now and then. As an academic acquaintance put it, “meritocracy” simply meant people who have “merit” (whatever that is) get the right to give stuff to their friends via government. The real question, as I see it, is whether people who don’t have this “merit” can recognize this as something worth yielding to? Are the “meritorious” so powerful that they can’t be challenged? (This would be the unstable path) Or, do they produce such public benefit, even if it’s not their primary goal, that the masses are willing to tolerate them? (This is actually Mancur Olson’s argument–more important insight than the collective action stuff, I think.) This runs counter to what “meritocrats” today think “merit” means–just credentials, whether they actually produce anything useful, or not–actual raw power through which they can assert their rule or something useful for enough others so that they would tolerate your rule.). So today’s meritocrats are just bandits, not the bandits with some “redeeming” values that Olson saw. This cannot be a stable thing…. In regard to Musk’s 5 points email, they are explicitly stating that they will use LLM Artificial Intelligence to review the responses. This almost certainly means Musk’s Grok. It seems to me that one could explicitly poison the AI with responses. BUT THAT WOULD BE WRONG, THAT’S FOR SURE!!!! Your email address will not be published.

Title: Ultimate Alexa Guide: 200+ Voice Commands to Master Your Amazon Echo

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement With the right commands, your Amazon Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices can control your smart home, stream music, automate everyday tasks, and much more. You can use all of these Alexa commands if you have the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock. Amazon's voice assistant Alexa is much more than just a talking tablet. In fact, like Siri on your iPhone, Alexa can do way more than you probably realize. Playing your go-to Spotify playlist or checking the weather forecast is just the tip of the iceberg. With simple voice commands, Alexa can control your Fire TV devices, streamline your daily routines, and turn your home into a fully automated smart haven. Want to try something with Alexa? You probably can -- you just need to know the right words to say. If you have an Echo at home and want to get the most out of Alexa, here are all the voice commands you should try. Alexa is set to get an AI overhaul. We saw Amazon demo its new AI-backed commands back in 2023, but the rollout of this big AI update has been pushed. There are several Reddit threads like this one, discussing how the "Let's chat" AI command isn't properly available yet, so all we can do right now is wait it out. Prior to that, Amazon had announced new hardware products while also talking up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library, including: By default, Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request, just say, "Alexa." You can change the wake word to something else if, say, your own name is Alexa, or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon, Echo or Computer. To change it, in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually). If you have an Amazon Tap, Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote, you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa. There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word, if you enable it. When you do, Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say, "Stop." Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like, "Alexa, play folk music at volume six," or, "Alexa, add bread, milk and eggs to my shopping list." Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen, the living room or anywhere for that matter. While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon, it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant. In fact, there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time, and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have: You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will, however, disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. "Hey, Siri" or "Hey, Google" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise, you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant. On an updated Windows computer, you can summon Cortana and say, "Open Alexa." After the initial connection is made, saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana. Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device, but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors, for example). The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect, but it's pretty great at understanding natural language, so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted. When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of, visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com. Here are all the native Alexa commands. The Echo Show devices and Echo Spot are the only Echo speakers with touchscreen displays. This means you can tell them to show you things. You can ask your Echo show to show you things using voice commands. You can now use compatible Echo devices (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show and Amazon Tap) to control your Fire TV and Fire TV Sticks. Amazon also builds its Fire TV operating system into televisions like the Element EL4KAMZ17 series. All of the commands above work on those too, in addition to a few TV-specific commands below. Alexa commands also work with Fire TV products. You can make calls and leave voicemails to other Echo users, as well as "Drop In" to your own echo devices, either to voice or video chat with whoever's in the room (or just to monitor the space like a security camera). If you have an Android, you can send text messages with Alexa. Control purchases, shopping lists and notifications with your Echo device. To turn on notifications, open the Alexa app and select to Settings, then Notifications, then Shopping Notifications and toggle it on. Your Echo speakers will light up yellow when you have new notifications. Alexa can answer all of your music and movie-related questions. Kids can ask Alexa to play parent-approved music and stories with the Echo Dot Kids Edition. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more. Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms and devices. Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used). Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill -- but rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list. For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future. Ring in the holiday season -- or the spooky season -- using you Echo devices. Alexa comes chock-full of Easter eggs and jokes -- the list is long. We cover the strange world of Alexa Easter eggs here, noting some of the more popular or prominent commands that prompt a snarky or humorous response. For even more, check out this Reddit thread dedicated to Alexa Easter eggs. This story is periodically updated.

Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) Caterpillar daily price chart, 2 24 25. The November 204 high is near $415. The January high of near $410 meets selling and goes no higher.

It looks as if it may cross below the 200-day moving average next or in a few weeks, a sign of further weakness. That the price is below both of the moving averages is not a bullish look and that it’s dropped below the early January low of just under $350 reinforces that. A test of the September 2024 low near $325 may be next. United Healthcare (NYSE: UNH) UnitedHealth Group daily price chart, 2 24 25. The stock peaked in early November at almost $630. The re-test in early December made it up to just $620, a failure to establish a new high.

Note that the price has dropped below the previous support levels of the early November 2024 low and is testing the low from early September 2024. If a more serious bout of selling begins, the August 2024 low near $380 may be tested. Merck (NYSE: MRK) Merck daily price chart, 2 24 25. Although the stock has rallied over the last few days, the price has along way to go to look bullish again. The 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average in early September 2024 and has remained below it since then. The early February 2025 gap down took Merck below the mid-November low. If this month’s gap is filled, the stock would climb above the 50-day moving average.

Title: AT&T, Verizon Use AST's 'BlueBird' Satellites to Power Video Calls on Phones

In the race to develop satellite services, AT&T and Verizon are both hailing recent tests that show they can power video calls on US phones using next-gen satellites from AST SpaceMobile. The video calls tap into AST’s BlueBird satellites, which the Texas-based startup launched into space back in September. The five satellites have since been orbiting Earth, with the goal of operating as cell towers in space that can connect unmodified phones on the ground. Although AST is still working for approval from the US Federal Communications Commission to operate the satellites commercially, the company did receive clearance last month to test the BlueBird constellation with both AT&T and Verizon — two of the startup’s major investors. In AT&T’s case, the carrier used a BlueBird satellite to power a video call from a phone in Midland, Texas, to another device in Dallas, while harnessing the carrier’s radio spectrum. Meanwhile, Verizon was able to do the same, but through the BlueBird 2 satellite; one phone was connected via satellite and the other was using Verizon’s terrestrial network connection. The carriers didn’t offer details, such as the quality of the video call or the connection speeds. But AT&T has uploaded a short clip, showing what the video call looked like. As you can see, the video quality is a bit grainy, but the call is successfully carried out. The results are also similar to the video call test Vodafone conducted in the UK last month, which also used AST's satellites. Competitor T-Mobile is aggressively trying to build interest in its own satellite-to-phone service through SpaceX’s cellular Starlink system, which currently supports text messages. Earlier this month, T-Mobile opened the beta program to test cellular Starlink connectivity for all US users, including those on AT&T and Verizon’s networks. In July, the company plans to start charging $15 per month per line for T-Mobile subscribers and $20 per month per line for all other users. Hence, consumers can expect a heated rivalry as AT&T and Verizon tout their own advancements in satellite-to-phone services, which aim to end cellular dead zones. In AST's case, the startup has designed its extremely large satellites to power voice calls and video and data downloads with speeds reaching over 20Mbps. The problem is that AST SpaceMobile only has five satellites in orbit, in contrast to SpaceX’s cellular Starlink constellation, which spans close to 500 and will one day support voice and video calls. AST will need several months or even a year before it launches the needed 45 to 60 BlueBird satellites to offer continuous coverage over the US. In the meantime, the FCC has given AT&T and Verizon temporary clearance to test AST’s existing BlueBird satellites with up to 2,000 devices in the US.

February 24, 2025 12:22 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Merck & Co., Inc. ("Merck" or the "Company") (NYSE: MRK) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Merck investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=131248&wire=3 MRK investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Merck during the relevant time frame, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases. Our firm has extensive expertise representing investors in complex securities litigation and a team of over 70 employees to serve our clients.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, on December 20, 2024, Novo issued a press release announcing the below-expected results of their “REDEFINE 1” trial, “a 68-week efficacy and safety trial investigating subcutaneous CagriSema.” The trial showed that patients treated with CagriSema exhibited weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, well short of Novo’s targeted expectation of at least 25% weight loss. The press release further indicated that participant patients were permitted to modify their own dosage during the trial and, as a result, only 57.3% of patients treated with CagriSema were on the highest dosage contemplated by the study. Following this news, Novo’s stock price fell by $18.44 per share to close at $85.00 per share. WHAT'S NEXT?

Title: Apple says it will spend $500 billion in US over next four years as it faces down Trump tariffs

Spending is said to include over 20,000 new American workers and the production of servers in Texas. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Apple today announced a plan to spend $500 billion in the United States in the next four years, including in jobs, suppliers, and building servers. This comes as Apple — like most consumer electronics companies — faces down a threat of tariffs from importing goods and components from China and other countries from President Donald Trump.The company says this is its biggest US-focused spending plan to date. Beyond jobs, it includes paying US-based suppliers, including factories owned by Texas Instruments and TSMC. Apple will build servers for Apple Intelligence at a facility in Houston, and claims it will increase its Advanced Manufacturing Fund and establish an "academy" in Michigan to "train the next generation of U.S. manufacturers, and grow its research and development investments in the U.S. to support cutting-edge fields like silicon engineering." Following a meeting between Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook last week, Trump said that Cook was ceasing plants in Mexico and would increase its spend in the US. “They don’t want to be in the tariffs,” he told U.S. state governors. It's unclear which Mexican facilities Trump was referring to, though Apple supplier Foxconn has some plants there, Bloomberg points out.The Trump administration has put a 10% tariff on goods imported from China and has mentioned, but not yet enacted, a 25% tariff on chips.Apple made a similar announcement in 2018 during the first Trump administration, including jobs and a campus in Austin, Texas. It's unclear which, if any, of the investments discussed recently were previously planned prior to Trump entering office for his second term. During the first term, Trump took credit for Apple's Mac Pro plant run by a contractor, which was already in operation.In 2021, Apple announced more U.S.-based spending plans, including a $430 billion investment including a North Carolina campus, as well as jobs in silicon engineering and research and development. (That campus is currently on pause)."We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said in a press release. Notably, the hiring commitments come at a time when much of big tech is going through layoffs.Cook's plans for US investments helped Apple during Trump's first terms, earning it exceptions from some tariffs on its biggest devices, including the iPhone. This time around, it appears other tech executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon chairman and former CEO Jeff Bezos, are trying to follow Cook's playbook by cultivating relationships with the president.

Title: ‘They got to get rid of it somehow’: Shopper buys 24-pack of Sprite from Walmart. Then they open up the cans
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/news/walmart-sprite-coca-cola/
Time Published: 2025-02-24T16:00:00Z

Stace Fernandez This Walmart shopper found something really strange in her Sprite cans. Now, viewers are starting to speculate. Sprite, known for its iconic lemon-lime flavor, is known to be a clear drink, unlike sodas like Dr.Pepper and Coca-Cola, which are brown, and even ginger ale, which has a slight yellow tinge. That’s why this woman was so freaked out once she started pouring the soda she just bought. In a trending TikTok, Walmart shopper Meagan McGee (@themeaganmcgee) shared the offputting thing she found when she went to open a Sprite. The clip garnered more than 200,000 views total, as it was posted twice. See, her husband just went to Walmart and picked up a 24-pack of Sprite. But when McGee opened one, the liquid inside was a dark brown. Maybe it was a fluke with just one soda being accidentally filled? That doesn’t seem to be the case. McGee had already poured out two cans, and the third had the same contents. “Every single one of these is pouring out Coke. Make it make sense,” McGee says. Now, the most logical explanation is that Coca-Cola and Sprite are owned by the same parent company. A big mistake may have been made during the packing process, and Sprite cans were incorrectly filled. But commenters have their own, potentially less plausible, theories. “I wonder to make up for the difference in sales coke cola is being sold as other products just a hunch,” a person said, referring to the Coke boycotts. “Thanks but i like my soda companies with no ICE,” another added, also in refence to the boycott. “I did some quality work in that industry and there is a way to track back to the technician who signed off for that particular can,” a commenter claimed. Last year, people started boycotting companies that donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign. Those boycotts have only grown as numerous big companies—including Target, Meta, Walmart, Amazon, and McDonald’s—rolled back their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Coca-Cola did donate to Trump. The soda brand was added to this boycott list, not for ending its DEI work, but because of rumors that they fired a slew of Latino workers in Texas and allegedly reported them to ICE, Yahoo reported. Let’s be clear up front: these are all rumors until evidence comes out. And so far, there is no evidence, fact-checker Distractify reported. Coca-Cola’s targeting of Latinos could have a huge business impact given that its Latin American division serves about 530 million consumers. A few other things. On layoffs: As a publicly traded company, Coca-Cola must disclose specific financial information. While not all layoffs are public record, one of the scales the rumors propose would certainly be included in their SEC filings. So far, there are no recent SEC filings or press releases on the matter.They did reportedly lay off 75 employees at the Grand Prairie, Texas plant that was closing—but that was in 2021. The Daily Dot reached out to McGee for comment via TikTok direct message and comment and to Coca-Cola via email. Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Title: A Costco executive on the luxury items its wealthy customers love
URL: https://qz.com/costco-gold-rolex-dom-perignon-tvs-dei-amazon-walmart-r-1851766107

Costco (COST+1.20%) is best known for its no-frills, bulk-buying experience, but the warehouse giant also moves a surprising amount of luxury goods. From Rolex watches to gold bars, high-end items have become an integral part of the business, and according to Hamilton “Tony” James, chairman of Costco, wealthier shoppers are hooked. “We’ve known we could move anything in volume if the quality was good and the price was great,” James said in an interview with Chief Executive magazine. That’s partly why the retail giant sells everything from Dom Perignon to 10-karat diamonds. According to James, Costco’s members are not just average-income households – they also include wealthier shoppers who recognize a good deal when they see one, like a Porsche on the sales floor of a Costco in Seattle. Costco, known for its “treasure hunt” shopping experience, won’t sell just anything. Unlike rivals Amazon (AMZN+0.25%) and Walmart (WMT+1.39%), Costco is selective about what it sells. While big-box retailers like Walmart stock over 120,000 different items, Costco limits its selection to about 3,400 stock-keeping units (SKUs). “We’re not interested in selling just anything at a low price,” James said. Instead of offering a $500 TV for $250, Costco would rather sell a $1,000 TV for $500. This formula has been a massive profit boost, further buoyed by the recent surge in gold bar sales. Wells Fargo (WFC+1.54%) noted last year in a research report that the company moved between $100 million and $200 million worth of gold bars each month. James told the magazine he wasn’t sure whether affluent shoppers or those wary of the economy were driving gold bar demand, but either way, the strategy has set Costco apart.

Title: A Costco executive on the luxury items its wealthy customers love

Costco (COST+1.20%) is best known for its no-frills, bulk-buying experience, but the warehouse giant also moves a surprising amount of luxury goods. From Rolex watches to gold bars, high-end items have become an integral part of the business, and according to Hamilton “Tony” James, chairman of Costco, wealthier shoppers are hooked. “We’ve known we could move anything in volume if the quality was good and the price was great,” James said in an interview with Chief Executive magazine. That’s partly why the retail giant sells everything from Dom Perignon to 10-karat diamonds. According to James, Costco’s members are not just average-income households – they also include wealthier shoppers who recognize a good deal when they see one, like a Porsche on the sales floor of a Costco in Seattle. Costco, known for its “treasure hunt” shopping experience, won’t sell just anything. Unlike rivals Amazon (AMZN+0.25%) and Walmart (WMT+1.39%), Costco is selective about what it sells. While big-box retailers like Walmart stock over 120,000 different items, Costco limits its selection to about 3,400 stock-keeping units (SKUs). “We’re not interested in selling just anything at a low price,” James said. Instead of offering a $500 TV for $250, Costco would rather sell a $1,000 TV for $500. This formula has been a massive profit boost, further buoyed by the recent surge in gold bar sales. Wells Fargo (WFC+1.54%) noted last year in a research report that the company moved between $100 million and $200 million worth of gold bars each month. James told the magazine he wasn’t sure whether affluent shoppers or those wary of the economy were driving gold bar demand, but either way, the strategy has set Costco apart. He expressed confidence in the company’s position against Amazon and Walmart, noting that Costco focuses on its own approach rather than its competitors’ moves. Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, however, dethroned Costco to claim the top spot in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) 2024 rankings for general merchandise retailers. Another area where Costco continues to be an outlier is in its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).

Title: Florida Sues Target Over Trans Merchandise

Time Published: 2025-02-24T15:00:42Z

First Amendment Elizabeth Nolan Brown | 2.24.2025 10:00 AM Florida is suing Target for selling LGBTQ-friendly merchandise, something the state is misleadingly calling "efforts to sexualize children." You're probably thinking: Wait, doesn't the First Amendment stop the government from doing things like this? Doesn't Target have a First Amendment right to sell goods broadcasting whatever perfectly legal messages it chooses, and don't individual Americans have a First Amendment right to access those messages? The answer is a resounding: of course. But Florida authorities don't seem to care, so long as they get to perform concern for children. You are reading Sex & Tech, the newsletter from Elizabeth Nolan Brown on sex, technology, bodily autonomy, law, and online culture. Want more on sex, technology, and the law? Subscribe to Sex & Tech. It's free and you can unsubscribe any time. Δ What the state considers the "sexualization of children" seems to be anything discussing gender identity or acknowledging that transgender people exist. On X, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier listed three of the products that he objects to: "rainbow sports bras for boys," swimsuits for transgender children, and books about gender identity. Like many anti-trans crusaders, Uthmeier doesn't bother elaborating on how products concerned with gender identity—whether someone identifies as male or female or neither or both—are related to sexualization. He expects his audience to take it as a given that anything related to transgender or nonbinary identities is rooted in (deviant) sexuality. As has been pointed out many times before: In cases like this, it's the anti-trans crowd who are sexualizing children, applying their adult interpretations of gender and sex to things that are not inherently sexual. A girl saying she feels like a boy is not automatically expressing anything related to sexual feelings or preferences, nor is a teenager who likes to wear elements of masculine and feminine clothing necessarily making a sexual statement. Likewise, catering to a market of transgender and nonbinary minors is not an attempt to sexualize them. And Florida isn't only objecting to products designed for children. On the first page of its massive 163-page class action complaint, the state complains about Target having sold "transgender 'tuck-friendly' women's swimsuits with 'extra crotch coverage.'" Ari Cohn, who serves as lead counsel for tech policy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has called Florida's lawsuit "asinine, performative buffoonery and an attack on the First Amendment." The state, he noted, is objecting to products "based on the messages they convey—all of which are First Amendment–protected, and none of which 'sexualize children.'" You do have to give it to Florida authorities for creativity. Presumably aware that the state can't simply ban messages it finds distasteful, the state is trying to frame this not as a matter of censorship but as a matter of Target's corporate duty to shareholders. "Target's efforts to sexualize children caused its stock price to plummet, harming Florida's retirement fund and putting the retirements of our teachers and first responders at risk," Uthmeier said in his X post. Uthmeier accused the company of "misleading shareholders" and promoting "a harmful leftist agenda at the expense of shareholder returns." By this argument, the state could engage in all sorts of censorship so long as it bought shares in whatever companies it wanted to bully into cracking down on speech. It could even demand the suppression of certain messages on social media on in search results by buying shares in companies like Meta and Alphabet. "It's beyond question" that the products Uthmeier objects to Target having sold are "expressive items" protected by the First Amendment, noted Cohn. "That Florida's retirement fund holds shares of Target is irrelevant and meaningless. Government does not gain the power to regulate speech because it's a shareholder." If Florida thinks Target stock is a bad investment, it can divest itself of Target shares. It cannot use them as an excuse to say what sorts of perfectly legal messages the company may broadcast. Even if Florida could somehow sweep First Amendment issues aside, the state might not have much of a case. The new lawsuit, filed in federal court, "is one of at least three similar cases against Target in Florida," reports the Tallahassee Democrat. It claims that Target CEO Brian Cornell and the company's board of directors violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by failing to "oversee or disclose the obvious risks of Target's 2023 LGBT-Pride Campaign" and thus "deceived Target investors." In a previous Florida lawsuit against Target, the company disputed some similar claims. The company "repeatedly warned investors of the risk" that consumers might boycott over its initiatives, it said in a January 2024 filing in this case. Florida might be unhappy with "Target's business judgment about merchandising. But disagreeing with Target's business judgment does not give rise to an actionable claim under the securities laws." • Surrogacy is the new battlefield in reproductive freedom. • "Presenting people with more partisan video recommendations has no detectable polarizing effects on users' attitudes in the short term," according to a new study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "While we cannot rule out effects from long-term exposure or to small vulnerable subsets of users, our evidence is not consistent with prevailing popular narratives about YouTube recommendation systems radicalizing users en masse." • A new bill in Alabama would allow pregnant women to defer jail or prison sentences. "The woman would then serve a term of pre-incarceration probation under electronic supervision until 12 weeks after she gives birth," reports the Alabama Political Reporter. "That probation period would then be credited to the woman's sentence." • After Texas banned abortion in 2021, "the rate of sepsis shot up more than 50% for women hospitalized when they lost their pregnancies in the second trimester," reports ProPublica.

Title: Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer is betting on the human touch — and AI

AI tools are here to stay, Moyer says, but Vimeo wants to build on ‘authenticity.’ by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. AI tools are here to stay, Moyer says, but Vimeo wants to build on ‘authenticity.’ by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer. You probably know Vimeo from its beginnings as an artsier, more creative competitor to YouTube. But over the last few years, and especially after it went public in 2021, Vimeo has really turned itself into an enterprise software company, selling video hosting services to companies of all sizes. And this episode is a particularly fun full-circle Decoder moment — I interviewed Philip’s predecessor, Anjali Sud, both when she was the CEO of Vimeo and again more recently in her new gig as CEO of Tubi. So it was fascinating to close the loop and see how Philip is changing Vimeo after taking over, especially as the entire ecosystem of online video is shifting so rapidly. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Philip is pushing to make Vimeo a different kind of YouTube competitor, one that can support everything from independent creators to huge corporations. It’s a shift from the strategy Anjali used to reset the company and take it public, and there’s a lot of interesting nuance to it. Everyone wants to put videos on the internet, it turns out, but only some of those people want them to be ingested by YouTube’s advertising and recommendation systems. Philip himself has a ton of big tech experience: he’s worked at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and he’s deep in the weeds on both the tech and the business. You’ll hear us talk about Google’s business and YouTube in particular quite a bit in this one, but we also get into TikTok and what it means to have the incentives of algorithmic video platforms drastically influence both creators worldwide and the culture we all consume. Of course, we talked about AI, too, and how it’s upending every platform in different ways. Vimeo has been marketing itself as an “AI-powered video platform” lately, so I wanted to know what Philip is thinking about Vimeo’s creator-focused mission colliding with the pitfalls of AI-generated video. We also spent some time on the simple supply-and-demand math problem that seems like it will change the creator economy drastically in the years to come: that is, if the amount of video on the internet explodes because of AI while the total amount of time we can spend watching video remains relatively fixed, how is anyone going to make any money at all? This is a fun one; I think you can really tell that Philip and I could have kept talking for a very long time. Okay, Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Philip Moyer, you are the CEO of Vimeo. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you, Nilay. It’s great to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. I have got to tell you, just structurally, this is one of the very first truly full-circle Decoder episodes. Because we had your predecessor Anjali on as CEO of Vimeo, and then we had her on in her new job as CEO of Tubi, and now we have you on as her replacement. Wow, it’s full circle. It’s full circle for a show that’s about structure, decision-making, and organizational culture — this is as good as it gets for me. So thank you so much for joining us. That’s fantastic. I have a lot of respect for Anjali and have to say a big thank you to her for all she built here, so it’s wonderful to hear. I’m very curious. Anjali was in the middle of executing a big pivot when we talked about Vimeo. People know Vimeo as what it started as — a consumer video service, kind of the art-ier competitor to YouTube. She pivoted it to a [software-as-a-service] business. She was very open: “This is now a SaaS company, we’re doing a lot of enterprise work, we’re a video hosting provider to a lot of people, we are a video creation tool for small businesses.” That was several years ago. I talked to her three years ago at Vimeo. You’re the new CEO. What do you think of Vimeo today? I think in a lot of ways, I mean a little bit of what she started, and a lot of what we’re continuing here, is going back to the roots of what Vimeo is known for. People came to us because, at the time, 20 years ago, it was hard to upload video. I kind of call that… I’ll say the second or third epoch of video was right around that time period when video files were getting bigger. It was hard to stream video. They were no longer just a single file. We were starting to get multiple formats. People came to us because of the quality of our transcoding and then, ultimately, our ability to be able to serve it directly to the person that was most important that they wanted to provide that video. And a lot of what we’re doing right now, and what we’ve taken that Anjali had started and extended pretty significantly is… It turns out that lots and lots of organizations and individuals around the world want to be able to keep a video private or they want to be able to serve it only to an intended audience. They don’t want to have someone collect data, they don’t want to have an algorithm that tries to send them down a rabbit hole. Instead, they want to just literally be able to provide that video. And so we’re seeing that video makes up about 82 percent of the world’s internet today and we’re seeing that same concept arrive with private individuals, doctors, educators, and large organizations. And so yes, I would say that what we’re really becoming now is… Our goal is to become the largest private video distribution platform in the world. We think that there’s an increasing demand for video that isn’t public or algorithm-driven, but instead, it could be very personal and delivered at the right moment, at the right time, to the right individual. Let me try to just understand that in context. There was the beginning of [shared video], right? You’re saying there are several epochs of [online] video. There’s the beginning, which was on iOS as a “send to YouTube” button at the operating system level because no one thought that public videos were a big deal. You just needed someplace to watch videos and YouTube was that. And then YouTube grew into the social media juggernaut it is now. TikTok exists, all that’s there, and the initial reaction was that it’s very hard to compete with that. “We’ll be for enterprises, business customers have video needs, we’ll service them.” Are you saying there’s some kind of middle ground, in the middle of the spectrum between big algorithmic consumer video platforms and enterprise, where just a lot of regular people want private video sharing? We have hundreds of thousands of school districts that use us. Teachers want students to be able to upload video assignments. Especially in a world of ChatGPT and AI, teachers want to see that the student is actually doing the assignment. We’ve got tens of thousands of medical professionals who want to be able to send a video to a patient without having some algorithm capture their disease state or the question that they have. We’ve got lots and lots of marketing organizations that want to be able to serve their video over to an individual inside of a big company, or to their client, and they don’t want it to be public. And then what we’re also finding is, on the YouTube front, organizations that were hosting entire YouTube sections on their website… YouTube is redirecting its customers over to some other place. I was meeting with a really large financial services company’s CEO and the chief economist. I took them to the website and I said, “Let me show you your chief economist speaking.” I clicked on the video, and before the video played, we had to watch some advertising on some Bitcoin or something. And on the right-hand side, it said, “Here’s how the top three credit rating organizations are trying to control the world. This is the video you should watch next.” And we’re just trying to watch the economist’s video. So organizations are getting tired of being redirected or having their data captured. A lot of organizations are starting to bypass what I call the big walled gardens, and in a lot of ways we’re back in the MSN and AOL era for websites. That’s where we are with video right now and people want to be able to go directly to their consumers. They want to be able to serve the message in an unfettered way, and then ultimately, they just want to be able to ensure the highest quality and the most personalized experience. We’re seeing tremendous demand for those kinds of scenarios. Again, it’s everything from the school teacher, the fitness instructor, and in some cases, the faith institution, all the way up to some of the biggest companies in the world — and I do mean that literally the biggest companies in the world are becoming customers. I think the thing that I’m keying on there is… there’s the consumer-facing video platforms and then you have a bunch of enterprise video needs and you’re in some way describing a bunch of core enterprise customers, right? Large school districts, and companies big enough to have a chief economist. I think those are classic enterprise customers and then somewhere in the middle, those companies actually want to reach consumers without participating in algorithmic media, and that consumer surface is what Vimeo has gotten away from. Are you saying you’re pushing back towards it? We get about 100 billion views of video a year on Vimeo, and only 20 percent of it is on Vimeo.com. We show up on e-commerce platforms. I was meeting with a physician, who is an independent practitioner, a fertility doctor, and he records a video before his patients come in and he sends that video over to his patients in the fertility clinic. So we have individual proprietors, people who want to be able to share a family video or something that they learned if they had been at a doctor’s visit or otherwise — so we have lots and lots of people that are using [the platform as] individuals. Now on the filmmaker side… What is most amazing to me right now is the sheer number of filmmakers that I have coming to me, and this has really started kicking up since I’ve become CEO. I would tell you it’s been a trend for about the past six months. I have so many filmmakers that are coming to me saying, “We don’t like the deal… We don’t like the deal that we have with the big studios. We don’t like the fact that if we go to YouTube, as an example, they take 45 cents of every advertising dollar. Or if we want to go onto one of the big platforms, they’ll take as much as 50 cents of every dollar. Is there a way for me to be able to sell tickets to my audience?” In some cases, some of these filmmakers that come to us have audiences that are bigger than they might get on one of those platforms and so we’re finding people who want to go direct. Our streaming business is like that. When you post on some of these big platforms… I really encourage people to look at the terms of service of the major consumer-based video platforms. It says in their terms of service that they’re able to monetize your content any way they want to. They can reuse your content, they can serve the content, and quite frankly, they’re capturing 45 cents of every dollar in that process. So a lot of these organizations want to be able to bypass those kinds of economics. So is that you building a consumer interface? You’re saying it’s only a small percentage that’s coming to Vimeo.com. Where are they finding an audience? Is it all on their own websites? Is it on other people’s platforms? Where is that audience actually going? It’s been interesting because there is this trend among streamers in particular where they’ll go to the large platforms, they’ll get some following, and then when they want to be able to serve premium content. That’s when they’ll come over and say, “We want to put SVOD. We want to be able to put a gate in front of this content.” Or they may want to go live, they may want to go asynchronously, and so they’ll come to us and say, “Look, we want to be able to have a common library so that people can see past live events.” Plus, they want to be able to serve new content. In some cases, we’re getting organizations that want to do more interactive content — so like clickable videos, as an example. It’s a whole variety of creators that are saying, “Look, we might not want to adhere to the… let’s call it compliance requirements, the economic requirements, or the IP requirements of the big platforms. Give us an environment that we can control ourselves.” And that environment lives on their websites? Exactly. Sidemen is a great example of a group. They have one of the biggest followerships in the UK. They sold out Wembley Stadium in two hours and they famously played a soccer match where, when a yellow card was shown, one of the Sidemen held up an Uno reverse e-card to the ref and it blew up the internet over in the UK. They serve on Vimeo. They have both content that they put on YouTube or they put on Instagram, but then some of the more extended content they actually put on Vimeo, and then that library lives on us as well for a lot of things. Dropout’s is another great example of that. Try Guys is a great example of that. Zeus Networks, Martha Stewart — where they want a little bit more control over the content and they want control over the monetization more so than what the traditional platforms give you. I’m going to ask you a question, and you’re just going to have to bear with me on the mathematical nature of this question. Hopefully, it makes sense. I have a lot of CEOs of web hosting companies on the show because I’m very curious about the web in the age of platforms and where the audience comes from. The last great referrer of web traffic is, as everyone knows, Google Search; Google Search is undergoing some sort of gigantic AI-powered identity crisis. Who knows what’s going over there, but it’s changing. So I have the CEO of Squarespace or the CEO of Wix, or whatever other hosting providers, and I say, “Why does anyone build a website? Why would you do that instead of starting a TikTok channel now?” And they all say, “Well, it’s to do e-commerce, right?” Embedded in that is some sense that, “Okay, you’ve built a following on some platform, now you want to sell something to your audience. And you have to sell the spoons somewhere, so you’re going to start Spoons.com and that’s going to be hosted on Squarespace, and that’s the way it goes.” You’re describing the content itself as being valuable, and being more valuable when it’s hosted on Vimeo. Maybe you’re selling it, maybe you’re doing subscriptions, whatever you’re doing. But that’s happening on a website because you can’t transact that way on YouTube or TikTok. You can’t make the content valuable, but you’re still stuck with how you get the audience to come to the website that’s still just some fraction of a search audience or some fraction of conversions from one of the social video platforms. And that — this is the math — seems like the upper bound of your growth. Because some number of people have to come to the website, some number of people have to choose to transact on a video from the Try Guys, and that can only grow insofar as all of those individual customers can get people to come to the websites. Do you see that the web is the limiter in that way? No, not at all. I’ve worked for Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in my life. Most recently at Google, I worked in all manners of businesses and data problems, and I have this foundational philosophy that there’s actually more data behind firewalls and paywalls than there is in front. There’s more information behind those firewalls and paywalls than in front. And when I take a look at the enterprise market for video… In the past, you’d have a marketing video and it was hard, or you might have a couple of product videos for e-commerce. Or you might have, for example, the CEO’s message. Video is coming to literally every single element of business. In the same way that it’s 82 percent of the internet, it’s coming in [to business]. And so whether or not it’s that e-newsletter, whether or not it’s for sales… You look at an organization like Seismic or Gong, that records sales calls, and then it helps to coach individuals. If you watch a video, you’re 67 percent more likely to buy a product. And so we’ve got very large e-commerce customers where they now have millions of videos on us that are serving to every single product page on their website. So what I’m seeing is quite frankly that there is an explosion of video. It’s such an engaging medium. When you watch a video, you have 91 percent better retention than when you read something. A lot of the stuff that’s behind the firewall and behind the paywall is now getting video enabled, and it’s going across every single division inside of an organization, and it actually dwarfs what I’ll call a lot of the content. We’re going to see video show up in so many different ways and in so many different businesses. People are starting to use video to be able to determine efficiencies inside quick-service restaurants. They’re starting to use video to be able to evaluate what’s on a shelf and whether or not there’s a stock on the shelf. So when I think about this, I don’t think about it just in terms of one segment of our organization. Actually, the beauty of Vimeo is that we’re able to live inside and outside the firewall, and YouTube does not live inside the firewall. We’re able to hook in and sign a [business associate agreement] to do HIPAA for a doctor. YouTube’s not going to do that. You think about all the interactions in the healthcare industry that actually can be video-enabled… And so our upper bound of growth is a larger opportunity than what YouTube is focused on right now. YouTube, right now, is focused on video podcasts. They picked their shot and they’re going to take it. By the way, every time anyone says that stat about video retention, I feel like a dinosaur because I need to read. For as much video podcasting as I literally do, I am a reader. I’m an underliner. I have to underline things. I learned to highlight with five colors in law school. It’s still where I’m at. Maybe the future is video and that’s why we do a video podcast, but I’m still a reader to my core. There are three parts of the video business. We’ve talked a lot about distribution, and where you might distribute that video. It sounds like that’s where you think there’s a lot of growth across organizations, even to consumer in some new way. Then there’s monetization, which I want to go to, but the first part is the hardest and I think undergoing the most change in terms of what we expect videos to be, and that’s obviously creation. You need to make a video, you need to distribute it, you need to monetize it. The creation of video right now is super interesting because you have not just the young generation, but everybody learning to speak the language of TikTok. TikTok, I think, is most importantly expressed to people as a video editor, not just a scrolling video tool, and it’s a very powerful video editor that you can also use in CapCut. Then there’s AI, which is making it a lot easier to make all kinds of videos in all kinds of ways, and then there’s the smaller AI components, like it’s going to write a script for you that you can read and maybe that’s good. Maybe that’s bad, but it’s all just in the mix. Everyone is expecting the tools to guide them. You can see in particular how TikTok tools, challenges, filters, and templates create a kind of culture that builds upon itself. Are you thinking of that component of it? Like “We need to build an enterprise TikTok editor for people just to bring them into the pipeline?” I think there are a couple of dynamics that are happening right now. This is what gets me so excited about this… One of the biggest things that brought me here is that the barriers to video creation are dropping so dramatically, which leads to that mass proliferation of video, and then the difficulty in being able to manage at that scale. That’s just, foundationally, the market forces that are behind us. I always pause for a second and tell people, “I’ll be able to talk to you for a long time about artificial intelligence in a couple of seconds, but let me talk to you about what’s happening in video formats.” You’re one hundred percent right. Right now, we’re in that era when mobile video is becoming much easier. People are becoming more comfortable. Covid really helped us get comfortable with dogs barking in the background, babies being inserted into frames, and basically, I’ll just call it more casualness, in video. Before it was highly scripted, if you recall. Highly scripted. And so culturally, people are getting much more comfortable shooting video. The proliferation of tools has been extraordinary. Now, we did make some acquisitions in the past. Magisto was an example of this because we really felt that we had to make it easier and easier to be able to create video. Well, I was thrilled with the proliferation of tools. We shot a video for our Reframe conference. I shouldn’t say shot a video — we actually created a video using 16 AI tools that didn’t exist 18 months ago. Over $15 billion of venture capital has gone into creating those tools and that’s just one small set. But you’re absolutely right… You’ve got all these tools that are being created and so we are thrilled about that, but simultaneously, the format of video is also proliferating, and so you’ve got traditional like 1068, and you’ve got 4K that’s starting to become more commonplace. 8K is arriving. When you do 8K, it’s roughly about six times the size of a 4K video. Well, 16K and 32K televisions are on the horizon right now. You’ve got wide stream formats, square formats for podcasting, rectangular formats, and then we just recently released Apple Vision Pro support to be able to stream on an Apple Vision Pro — which is 8K per eye, 36 frames per second. Simultaneously, while the tools are proliferating, the format types are also proliferating. So, your ability to both accept video from any format… In some cases, you accept something that’s an old, old format that you have to get improved, or it’s a super high quality, giant widescreen format that needs to be cut up for all the different areas that you’re going to serve that video. What I would tell you is that it’s becoming more complex for the creator to choose which tool to use and when, and then how to ensure that the right format gets served at the right moment. So the two simultaneous things that are happening in our business are creative tools and formats, and they are exponentially growing right now. They’re exponentially growing the amount of video that a creator has to deal with. What’s growing the fastest? It’s really interesting. As you can imagine, I think the square format is popping up a lot. We are seeing a lot of demand for 4K — 4K in live formats and in serving formats. I think people are starting to demand that format more, which is obviously for us… We have to move more bits, we have to store more bits, we’ve got to transcode more bits, and so I would tell you that’s probably the thing that we’re seeing spike the most in terms of consumption. The traditional mobile stuff is going to be there and it’s going to be constant. I think it’s almost growing at the speed of so-called mobile phones, but I’m actually surprised about how many people are coming to us asking us for 4K. Why do you think that is? I look at the broader industry and you see the big streamers are pushing everybody to 1080p with ads. That’s sort of the default for Max or Netflix, and then you have to pay extra for 4K. Are you seeing that demand in the same way they do, which is that people will pay extra for it? Or are you seeing that demand as this is now the understood industry norm? It may be the place that we sit in the industry. As I mentioned at the top of our talk, people have always come to us for quality. So it may just be that because we’ve been known for quality — we’ve been known for the quality of our transcoding, our stream, the service that we do — that people are not finding that kind of support elsewhere and coming to us for it. I think that people are experimenting with those formats. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the sheer number of people who have come to us since we launched the Apple Vision Pro. They are coming to us with really interesting film projects to do 8K per eye, stitching all the camera work together. You’ll see us talk a lot about this at SXSW, about what we think. I’m seeing some good excitement in those 8K formats as well, that’s all I’ll say, but it might just be the position that we sit in the industry. It’s so interesting to see the rest of the industry basically insist that consumers don’t care about 4K. You and I are talking two days before the Super Bowl. For all of Fox’s talk about 4K, they’re still producing that in 1080p and then upscaling it. It’s fascinating to see the consumer side of the market land at one standard quality level while you’re saying the enterprise side of the market — the more discerning part of the market — is now not only assuming that 4K will exist, but that you will support 8K per eye, 36 frames per second on the Vision Pro. And when there’s 16K for TVs out, I think people will be buying them. That’s a lot of cost, right? I mean you’re talking about moving an enormous amount of data. Are you just getting ahead of it because that’s what the customers expect? You have a background in cloud services and big data. Is that something where you say, “Okay, this is just scalable? We can solve this problem with the tools we have”? Or do you have to build new systems? It’s a little bit like… I’ll use the corollary of what’s going on with token size inside of AI models, where everybody knows that the very first version of ChatGPT was maybe, I don’t know, a hundred million tokens and then it popped over to a billion tokens and will be up to a trillion tokens. So the cost to be able to deliver all of that will come down over time. The cost of storage comes down, the cost of bandwidth comes down, and then even the innovations that are in the televisions, those costs will be coming down. When you think about the quality of the TVs we have now versus even just 10 years ago, it’s so discernibly different and I think that as those costs come down, somebody has to serve that content and our infrastructure... We have the infrastructure to be able to do it, and so for some of us, we have to stay slightly ahead so that we are that place that’s always viewed as quality. So yeah, I guess it has to be part of our DNA that we’re always going to support those cutting-edge formats. We’ve opened the door to AI and I definitely want to talk about that and in particular, using AI as a creative tool, and how your customers might be thinking about that and their relationship to it. But first, I just want to get to the Decoder questions. We’ve talked a lot about how you’re thinking about growing Vimeo’s business. What would you say is the most tangibly different thing you’re doing compared to your predecessor Anjali? There are a couple of things. I think Anjali was supporting a lot of different businesses. I’ll say as you went through covid and as you went through when video was hard… I would say it wasn’t as culturally ingrained as it is right now. She had to make a lot of decisions around the business. When I got here, a lot of people asked me this question: “Well, do we serve the consumer or do we serve the enterprise? Do we serve the filmmaker or do we serve the physician?” When I really spent time with who our customer was, I really had to get deep, deep, deep down inside and go, who really uses us? Show me the type of company, show me the names of the companies, and the industries that we’re in. It was very clear to me that we serve the creator who is professional, somebody who is using video for their business professionally. It’s not a hobby. It’s actually to get a job done. Being able to consensus around that creative pro, not trying to go and create a YouTube competitor or a low-cost tool for the hobbyist, but truly that we serve that professional creator, and then being able to describe very succinctly the fact that all of that comes together. Sometimes a professional creator wants to serve a single video. Sometimes they need to be able to manage thousands of videos. Sometimes they want to be able to go live, sometimes they need a high quality, and sometimes they need help to divide it, to cut it up into rectangular or square formats. I think one of the core things that I did when I got here was really obsess about the customer. Every meeting we start, we start by telling a customer’s story. I learned a lot of this, I would tell you, between Google and Amazon. Amazon is, I would say, renowned for this, but we really tell the stories of who our creators are and then really build the ability to move quickly and listen to those enterprise requirements. When you start a company, and… I started at Microsoft in the very early days of Microsoft. It wasn’t an enterprise company then, believe it or not. Amazon, when I got there, didn’t have a lot of financial services companies using the cloud. I went through that transition. At Google, it wasn’t really known as an enterprise-grade cloud when I first got there. So I’ve been through this transition, and when you start a product that is going to serve the enterprise, what I always tell people is that it’s easier to get more complex, but it’s really hard to be complex and get easier. And so we were starting from these roots as a consumer and filmmaker’s product, and a lot of what I’ve focused on is really listening quickly to not just our individual customers, but the entire spectrum, and being able to say yes to those requirements. I also come with a tremendous amount of experience as you can imagine. You could look at my background — it’s years of enterprise experience, and so, I know what’s required to be able to do HIPAA. I understand how to do General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). I understand compliance requirements. When we go into things like artificial intelligence, or we go into storage and distribution, I have a lot of instincts around that. Spending the time to explain where we’re going as a company, to be able to serve both inside and outside the firewall, and the requirements that we’re going to have architecturally, and just explaining that to the organization and weaving together… Hey, that filmmaker wants their content protected the same way that the largest retailer in the world or the CEO wants their content protected, then weaving those two messages together and building a product roadmap that’s going to serve both. I feel like that’s probably the biggest thing that I’ve done since getting here: unifying the vision into a single cohesive vision. And then the second thing is really making sure that all of us are telling the stories. “Hey, did you know that this fertility clinic is using us in this way? Did you know that this school teacher is using us in this way? Did you know that this faith organization uses us in this way? Do you know that the largest retailer uses us this way?” Getting people to tell the stories internally, I think, was important. The last thing I’ll tell you is that there was a little bit of a shine that came off the company after the IPO. I think, giving the company confidence and saying, “Let me tell you who’s actually using us.” I don’t think that a lot of people really realized, internally even, the broad array of customers we have. I put this in our shareholder letter: we have eight out of the top eight big box retailers. We have eight out of the top eight media companies that are using us internally. We have huge numbers of insurance and financial services companies, companies that could use anybody, and I said they’re using us for a reason. So getting some confidence back into the company that we actually are an incredibly valuable tool in a world of increasing complexity — I think that gives the company a lot more confidence to be even bolder as we go forward. You’re talking a lot about culture change, and renewed focus. The thesis of this show is that that comes out of structure. I’m just looking at our notes here from my producers. In the past few months, you’ve named a new chief marketing officer, a new chief information security officer, a new people officer, and a new chief revenue officer. You’re obviously making some changes in the organization. How was Vimeo structured and how are you restructuring? I think that, in some cases, our technology organizations were incredibly siloed. How we did trust and safety as an example, in some cases how we did data, and who owned which parts of engineering. They were actually broken up in a lot of ways. I think oftentimes our marketing organization had one mandate while the sales organization might’ve had another mandate. A lot of what I would tell you was really important to me… One of my first hires was a chief technology and product officer, Bob Petrocelli. I brought in an individual who unifies product engineering and is able to have single-threaded leadership over top of parts of the business that are that important. They have to be working together well. Some of the things that we’re doing in trust and safety, we actually think we can turn around and expose that to our enterprise customers. It turns out they probably don’t want things on their platform the same way that we don’t want certain things on our platform. So getting any internal function to become an external function and getting that kind of view that we all serve the customer in some way, shape, or form is super important inside of our product and technology organizations. One of the most important things I had to do was bring in our Chief Marketing Officer, Charlie Ungashick, who has really extensive experience marketing to individuals and enterprise. We are going out and talking about how we can protect videos, serve videos, and provide AI to that entire audience. So we had to get an individual who was able to oversee both parts of the business. I’ve also done some recent restructuring where we put an individual completely in charge of what we call our self-service business. To be able to move even faster in that part of the business and obsess on everything from the top of the funnel all the way through when a subscriber comes in, right down to “what are we actually using in the product”… And this is a big element as well. I will tell you one of the other changes I didn’t mention is that we’re obsessing on use right down to the feature level. I look at those reports on a weekly basis, like how many people are using our edit feature, and how many people are using our live feature. How many people applied permissions to a video? Did that increase week over week? What did we do? And so that self-service leader is really now a single-threaded leader, and we also had a single-threaded leader around our streaming business. We really started seeing some of the results from that inside the company. Giving single-threaded leadership, I will tell you it is talked about a lot, but oh my God, it’s beautiful to actually be able to call up somebody that owns the number, that owns the resources, that worries about it as much as you do every single day. Single-threaded leadership is an Amazon concept. You’ve worked at all the companies, so I can pick out where the concepts come from. It’s pretty fun for me. That’s a classic Amazon concept. It is. You need to have a pretty small team that owns the thing and there’s a leader who is responsible for the whole stack. That is how you get silos. You can look at Amazon’s product and say, “Oh, there’s a bunch of single-threaded leaders here.” This is not necessarily cohesive. Everything is running as fast as it can, but the holistic vision of the Amazon product suffers for it at scale, right? You started out talking about having too many silos and we’re talking about single-threaded leaders. How are you managing that tension? I was asked one time to give a talk on what it was like to work at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. I got an opportunity to work directly with Gates, Ballmer, Jassy, and then certainly with Thomas Curry and Sundar Pichai. One of the most important lessons I learned very early on at Microsoft was about really establishing a strong single-sentence vision for the entire company about what we’re trying to do in the future. And you wake up every single morning and I mean… I was there in the early days when the vision was a PC on every desktop in every home. That was extraordinary at the time. Now we have a PC in every pocket, but we all knew that what we were trying to do was unlock information for the world by putting this powerful computing device in someone’s hands. And so regardless of the divisions or otherwise, it all feathered into a common vision. It was a lot of what I had to do when I got here. I owed the company a strong agreement among everybody in the company about what we’re trying to build. Are we trying to build the best livestream product? Are we trying to build the best marketing platform? Are we trying to build a product for filmmakers? We settled on this common vision and then we’re able to say, “Okay, this is the individual that owns this part of the business.” There’s a huge portion of our individual business where people swipe a credit card and start using us or register for free. A huge number of those customers actually end up as enterprise customers. I called up one of the top retailers and started talking to him about Vimeo and he said, “Well, first of all,” he goes, “You don’t have to tell me who you are.” He goes, “My son is on Vimeo every weekend. He’s an independent filmmaker.” He goes, “So I know who you are, but why are you calling me?” And I said, “Well, we have 2,600 accounts, self-service accounts that are on [our platform]. We should do an enterprise agreement.” So being able to explain to the organization how the two sides work together and being able to make decisions in a room between where we’re applying more features may be in one part of the business or another… And how those features actually feather, how we might start them for an individual, but they have to grow to work for an entire enterprise — is all really, really important. Starting with a strong vision that everybody buys into, that they understand their piece of it, is really critical. And then for each one of those leaders, I expect them to have a strong vision for how they’re going to contribute to the overall vision. That’s another important thing. You can’t let their vision exist in the absence of the rest of the company’s vision, so you have to actively stitch those visions together. You brought up decisions. That’s the other classic Decoder question. I will warn you: this is a honeypot for former Amazon executives. When you ask Amazon executives how they make decisions, everybody sings chapter and verse, but you’ve worked at a bunch of places. You are now the CEO of this company. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? The other company I didn’t talk about that I learned a lot from was Google. One of the things that I would tell you Google gave me was that they managed something like 10 out of the top 11 billion-user products in the world and were really thinking big. Actually giving an organization incredibly lofty goals, and sometimes you only reach 80–90 percent of them. One of the things that I do first and foremost is — that I really am a believer in — that you’ve got to set these very high goals. You need to have this vision and you need to be willing to put yourself out there to set extremely high goals. And then back into that from a decision-making process, I would tell you that we’ve made a number of decisions around which products we focus on, which areas we deprecate. I come back to the customer. One of the things I really try to hold people accountable to, and I think it’s really important, I learned a lot of this both at Google and at Amazon, but actually explaining the customer problem that we’re trying to solve. And there are all kinds of studies that you can do. There are user studies, data studies, and so forth, but truly being able to assess what that workflow looks like. What are we trying to solve? What is the most challenging thing for the customer? What is actually frustrating the customer most? And really having a strong sense for your customer and the customer anecdotes as well as what we call... At Google, we called it customer empathy, actually putting yourself in the shoes of the customer. One of the things that we ask everyone inside of Vimeo to do is be a user of the product. So the things that are frustrating us, we are elevating those into our decision-making process. We both bring the voice of the customer in and, we bring our own voice in, and then we also are saying, “Okay, well what’s going to help us grow? What’s going to grow the next million users for us or what’s going to grow us to 10X?” So I can’t just tell you it’s one thing. It’s a little bit of a framework of the customer, making sure we’re tethered to big ideas and really making sure that we’re being innovative enough in how we push the team. Well, I applaud you for being the only former Amazon executive to not talk about one-way and two-way doors when I ask that. You’ve done it, you’ve achieved escape velocity. I mean, I appreciate the one-way and two-way doors. I’m just saying. No, I get it. I don’t know if I’d buy that. The thing I do love, I mean, at Google, I think they’ve proven that there’s not a lot of one-way doors. Fair enough. Google’s interesting. We’ve talked a lot about YouTube during this conversation. Vimeo has come out against YouTube. You have entire blog posts about how your search capabilities are better than YouTube’s search capabilities or how Vimeo is a better platform. You’ve talked, even in this episode, about wanting things to be private, not being part of the algorithmic ecosystem or the advertising ecosystem on YouTube. Google is big. They think so big that sometimes they let opportunities just slide away because they think at such a massive scale. How are you thinking about competing with YouTube at that scale when they seem to own so much of the attention, space, and video? I don’t think that a lot of product companies love the fact that you have to go to YouTube to get some customer support for one of their products. Meanwhile, one of their competitors could be rolling right next to you. And I think that when I look at YouTube… I was at Google and spent a lot of time with customers, and I really foundationally believe... I love YouTube, I’ll watch YouTube as much as the next person. I think that what they’re doing for, I’ll call it the attention economy, for what they’re doing around content, for democratizing access to more and more content — I think it’s absolutely wonderful. And quite frankly, as I said, a lot of our customers are great YouTube customers as well. People will house their videos on Vimeo and post on YouTube in a lot of ways. But I really do think that there is… In the same way that you don’t do a lot of your business on Facebook or you don’t do it on LinkedIn, you kind of do it behind closed walls. I think that a lot of the economy runs behind firewalls and paywalls. So I think that we can go directly at that. The other thing I’m going to say is… Think about what happened in content and why some of these platforms rose. Think about, and again, I’m old enough to remember MSN and AOL — the reason why we went there was because news had to be consolidated. It was hard to create websites. It was difficult to find information, it had to be curated. Well, Netflix and YouTube were born in an era where it was really hard to categorize content to say, “Hey, this video is about a cat,” or “This video is about how to plug an HDMI cord into the back of your LG TV.” And so there was categorization that had to take place. There was standardization of the data, the metadata, and then recommendations engines. I don’t know if you remember, but Netflix famously paid a million dollars to be able to write their recommendation engine. They went out and said, “Whoever builds the best recommendation engine will win a million dollars.” Well, with an AI model, I can categorize content in seconds now. With a recommendation engine, I can buy recommendation engines off the shelf. And quite frankly, the metadata that we can produce now out of a video is extraordinarily more detailed than a human being can even write. I can tell you precisely when the purse left the beach, who was carrying the purse, and what brand of shoes the individual was wearing. All stuff that may be missed when a human being has to enter all that metadata. And so what I see is that there is going to be a democratization of content classification, content recommendation, and context discoverability. I think that there are searches… There is a single search place that you go to be able to get your content, videos, and maps, and pick your favorite things. But I think that there are billions of dollars going into discovering other ways to find and interact with information. And so I think that Vimeo can serve that kind of information outside of a traditional Google search in a lot of ways, whether or not you’re on an intranet inside of a company, whether or not you’re inside an AI model and you don’t want to leave the ecosystem of the AI model. We can provide an answer to a question as well. I think YouTube is fantastic, I love it, but I think that for the discoverability, accessibility, indexing, and recommendations, there’s a whole new era coming and we intend to be a part of it. There’s another piece of that dynamic that I’m wondering if you are considering, which is that Google is a huge company that is under an enormous amount of pressure right now. Maybe it’s so much pressure that it will be hard for the company to execute. There’s an antitrust trial in this country that resulted in the government suggesting Google break itself up and sell Chrome. There’s Donald Trump in the mix, who may or may not make some sort of deal. There’s a Donald Trump in the mix who’s done a tariffs regime with China that resulted in a Chinese antitrust investigation of Google — which is amazing because Google doesn’t really operate in that country. Europe exists, much to the chagrin of many of our tech companies. There’s just a lot going on. There’s a lot of pressure on Google to not flex that dominance. And then there’s competitive pressure from the AI products, like ChatGPT, SearchGPT, and Bing — to whatever extent that Microsoft believes that Bing is a real competitor to Google. Does that create an opening for you? Do you see that as a real opening or is that just well, if those doors open, you’ll be ready? I have a lot of friends at Google. I really enjoyed my time there. I don’t wish them ill in any way, and I really hope that they sail through this era of challenge for them in a really great way. Clearly, I came here from Google because I saw the opportunity. I really did see the opportunity that… We’re about to go through a seismic shift in the accessibility of information with new ways to go and access it. Whether or not you’re using ChatGPT, Anthropic, or Mistral, there are so many different ways to be able to discover information. The notion of the common crawl on the web, the ability to be able to crawl the whole web, index it, and then to be able to ingest it into these models shows that it’s democratizing access to that information discovery. Video is a very important element of video, and I think you’d agree. You can’t just imagine only one platform is going to serve all the video answers in the world, and so that’s where I see it’s such a super opportunity for us at Vimeo. Let’s talk about AI. I want to start by asking a mathematical question. One of my theses for the year is that the creator economy is under an enormous amount of pressure. Not just from AI, but also from what you’re describing: this huge shift to video. You can see that there’s just an exponential increase in the supply of video on all these platforms. More and more kids are making videos. More and more people are choosing to communicate in video-first ways. More enterprises are doing it. And then you have AI, which is just making it easier and easier to produce a massive amount of video. So the platforms are getting flooded with supply. There’s not as much ad revenue as there is an increase in video supply, so you do the division and you’re like, well, the ad rates are going to go down, and then attention is sort of fixed. There are only so many people with so many hours in a day, and presumably, people do have to eat and do productive work. So attention is kind of fixed, right? It’s just like a fixed number that you can capture. That all just seems like it’s a bubble that’s going to pop. You flood an ecosystem that has been pretty stable for a few years with an enormous amount of supply, the ad rates go down, and attention stays fixed. Something happens in there, and it seems like, to me, AI is the most important component of that because it’s the thing that can change the economics of the supply the fastest. You just say, “Make 50 videos about my product,” and now we have 50 videos about the product on whatever platform. Is that an opportunity for you? That this whole creator economy, or the video creator economy as we know it, seems like it’s going to have a pretty basic shift in its economics? That’s a huge question. To me, it is the question of 2025 — if you asked me, “What is The Verge doing in 2025?” There’s Elon Musk and DOGE, and then there’s what happens to the creator economy. I think with the creator economy, we are reaching saturation. I mean, think of your own experience. I don’t know when we’re going to get to the post-mobile phone era, but this is not a way we’re going to live for the rest of eternity as human beings. And so on the creator’s side, yes, I think that there is a saturation point, but I also think that people are looking for a little bit of a higher quality experience. I think people are getting tired of the doom scrolling. I think the mere fact that we name it, the fact that we are now acknowledging that we get sent down rabbit holes... I do think people will like storytelling. And I do think there’s going to be really different opportunities. I get asked all the time, “When will AI be able to take my favorite book and turn it into a movie?” And now, think about that. Think about how wonderful that would be. Think about being able to take your child’s favorite book and turn it into a video for them that has an extended storyline. I think storytelling is as old as humanity and it’s going to continue forward and so I do — Can I just stop you there for one second? I know the Decoder audience fairly well. A lot of people just started screaming at you in their car because they think that’s a bad outcome. Do you think that’s a bad outcome? I have a young child. The idea that we’re going to read The Wild Robot and then some AI tool is going to make the movie The Wild Robot instead of the beautiful actual movie made by people, The Wild Robot — I would argue that that’s a bad outcome. I think it is for a class. Here’s what bugs me the most right now. Last year the big six studios only put out 88 movies. 88. Right, because the economics of video have collapsed on them. They don’t have a distribution monopoly. Exactly, and I think there are so many stories to be told. If the creator of The Wild Robot gets paid for having a movie and is able to be monetized in some shape or form, in a really beautiful way, I actually think we’re supporting storytellers in a foundational way. I think that that’s a decade away. I would say maybe five to seven years away. And so first and foremost, I do think that AI is going to help people create more stories. I think they are. I think they’re going to be able to illustrate more stories, let’s put it that way. I talk to a lot of creative types who tell me, “Look, AI is fairly disjointed right now. It’s indeterministic. I don’t know what I’m going to get out of it.” Human curation of AI creation is going to be a necessity, in the same way that shooting on a green screen and then being able to put in a background for a movie is indeterministic until the human being decides what’s on that green screen. What I’m saying is that I do think that longer-form stories are going to be more compelling. I think people are going to want to stay inside of a story a little bit longer. That doesn’t mean that the creator is going away. It doesn’t mean human curation is going away. I just think that we’re going to be able to tell more beautiful stories in more ways. So I’ll park there because we are pro-creator, we are pro-filmmaker, and we serve a lot of them. They’re not going away. We’re going to uplift them and make them faster. I think this is a real tension, and I see it expressed all the time. I’ve heard it from your peers on the show when they tell me about the tools that people use in Photoshop, right? Generative fill in Photoshop, according to Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen, is like a hundred percent usage rate. But then, everyone yells about generative fill existing, and there’s a real mismatch between consumer expectations and how people feel about AI, and then about the creatives actually using the tools at high rates. I get all that. I also think there’s a mismatch between you saying you’re for filmmakers and how marketers want to use AI. I think we’re careening towards a world of basically custom creative being shown to individual users. [A world] where some brand uploads their assets to a video platform and ads get assembled for you in AI. For you, a specific user, [to get] ads targeted to your interests. We’re headed there and the big platform’s already talking about it. But those really commercial uses of AI — “we’re going to make a whole bunch of ads and we’re going to do some of the most creative filmmaking that exists” — they don’t seem like they’re happening at the same rate or with the same level of acceptance, or even like they should happen with the same tools, and you have every piece of the puzzle in front of you. Where do you see the biggest growth and where do you see the biggest pushback? One of our creators, Jake Oleson, recently shot Currents for Apple Vision Pro. And when you shoot for an Apple Vision Pro, you have to maintain perfect stillness in the camera. You’ll shoot four to six cameras and by hand, you have to stitch all these things together. If you get an opportunity to watch Currents, it’s absolutely stunning. You kind of look at it and go, “Oh my God, I’ve seen the future of filmmaking. I truly have.” And I do think that this is where I say that I think we’re going to get into a post-mobile phone era for watching content and creativity. And I think that we’ll experience film in new ways. We’ll experience stories in new ways. And I think that I’m seeing the best creators blend together the content and AI usage with traditional techniques to make something incredible. Most filmmakers that I talk to start with something they’ve shot and then enhance it with AI. One of the things that is most interesting to me is that, in the marketing world, the thing that’s taking off the most right now are not avatars (and avatars, I like to call them… like nobody wants to talk to a robot), it’s actually people that are sitting there going, “Hey, I just bought this piece of furniture. This looks really cool. Let me show you what it looks like inside of my house.” Actually, authenticity in a world of robots I think is actually... I’m already seeing it. We offered to a number of our customers, “Hey, would you like us to do some avatars?” And then we also offered to them, “Hey, we have this super down-and-dirty create tool where you can record, we can put a teleprompter up in front of you so you can do your own script. And we can either make the avatar look perfect or you can be sitting in your living room and do this quick thing about your product or about your service.” And inevitably, all of them go to the real human being doing this. I’m just going to tell you point blank: I’m not seeing the robots take off. I’m not seeing it. And we’ve tried to serve both. I think that humans have always risen above. They’ve always brought authenticity. They’ve always brought through how you kind of know when you’re getting something and when you’re not. Even in the chatbot world, how many people get frustrated when they’re talking to a chatbot online? They quickly want to talk to a human being. I don’t know how to say it to you, but we sense that there are no ghosts in the machine. So I don’t know how to say it to you any other way. I studied artificial intelligence for a long time and I’m very confident in the beauty of the human soul in the context of creativity. I feel like I’m more cynical than you, but I spend more time on social platforms, it feels like. And the problem, generally, is you can sense it. Some people can feel it, and a lot of people cannot, right? Or they just let it wash over them and then you end up in sort of interminable fights about metadata or labeling. Google just rolled out SynthID for images that you edit in Google Photos. None of that stuff seems to have landed. It has certainly not landed in a universal way. Vimeo has some labeling features. You have some ideas about how you might show people AI-generated content or expose that metadata to people. Do you think that’s working? Is that something you’re going to continue? Is that something that you think needs to be expanded? When I was at Google, there were about 42 different regulatory bodies that were working on AI legislation. The last we checked, there are over one thousand on a worldwide basis. And I’m raising that to say that when you do translations in certain states inside of the United States, like Illinois or Texas, you can’t actually modify people’s lips and put words in their mouths, so that’s just one of the regulations. Over in Europe, you actually do have to identify that something’s been AI-enhanced or modified. So I do think that we as humanity are wrestling with it when we want to know that something’s not real. The mere fact that that’s coming from all over the world, that you’re seeing the desire to know when something’s not real, I can’t say whether or not that’s good or bad, but I can tell you that it’s actually a human desire. And so, getting something done like changing the credit card on my telephone bill, I’ll deal with a bot to do that. But if I’m really having a problem, or my elderly father-in-law is having a problem, I actually do want a human being to pick up the phone and just talk him through it. I guess what I’d say to you is… I think in filmmaking as well, we’ve always used tools to tell our story. It’s been the invention of so many tools to help us tell stories. AI is just another tool to help us tell the stories. I would certainly like to know when characters aren’t real. I guess this is the hardest question. This is an existentially philosophical question, but: Where do you draw the line? Where do you personally think the line should be for when you have to put the label on something? I’ll give you two examples. I think when I stabilize a video with AI, that does not require it. I think if I’m talking to a deepfake avatar, or a creator that is photorealistic, that is just lying to me, that situation probably requires it, right? I’ve replaced products in this movie with other products and that may require it. Where do you think the line is? I think that I haven’t been asked this question before, but as I reflect on it, I would like to know that a particular character, animal, or something that’s in the film is actually not real — that it’s completely made up. Now you can tell that in animation, but in a real film, if I know that a certain character or a certain scene is actually completely fabricated with a single individual in it, I probably would like to know that. Or when there’s dialogue involved where something’s talking back to me that’s not for real, I probably want to know about it. When I look at some of the Marvel movies, clearly you start crossing the line. Well, does the fox in Guardians of the Galaxy do it? We all know the fox is- The latest Marvel movie they just announced is Fantastic Four, and they made the poster with AI, and there’s fan backlash to it. So I’m just wondering if you see the norms moving faster than the technology, or slower? You are shipping these products and you have such a direct line to creators, so it feels like you’re caught up right in the middle of where we put the labels. The thing that really does bother me right now is the influencers that don’t even exist. If I’m looking at something that’s clearly animated, I’m okay with it. I would love to know that somebody’s voice was actually used for real by that individual. So it’s going to be complex and I wonder out loud, will we stop caring, and at what point? Will we become comfortable that basically the whole thing is simply animated because that’s really what we’re talking about? We’re just creating animation that’s higher and higher fidelity in a lot of ways. But I think it should probably be noted that, at some point, the human doesn’t exist. I feel like that’s probably where I’d cross the line, or that dog doesn’t actually exist, especially if the dog’s a main character. So you might end up doing it based on the classification of the importance of the character and whether or not there’s actual, true existence there. And how much modification was done to the individual based on the class of character in the story? I asked that question three different ways and pushed on it again because it feels like the pressure on the creator economy and the social platforms is just going to go up. With Meta, Mark Zuckerberg is out there openly saying, “We will have AI content in people’s social feeds on Facebook and Instagram.” How they choose to label it, whether or not the mean dogs have labels — I don’t know. I don’t know what Mark Zuckerberg is going to do. No one can see into his soul, but it’s pretty obvious that if he could get a bunch more cute cat videos on Facebook using AI, he’s going to do it. It’s obvious why he would do that. Does that create an opportunity for you to say Vimeo is for real content or real people? Is that something you would lean into? Because you do have the AI tools. When you open the website today, it says you’re an AI-powered video platform. There’s a lot of conflation between “we can do better classification and with better recommendations” and “we can do better marketing videos and we’re going to steal everyone’s data and make cat videos for Facebook attention spans.” I think as I sit here and think about protecting the Vimeo brand, I aspire to actually be the place that people trust. When I first got here, we were approached to basically crawl our content and it was like as many companies were approached… We talked to the creators and the creators said, “Listen, don’t replace us. Just uplift us and protect us. Make sure that Vimeo is always a place where we’re protected and that’s why we come to you and that’s why we want to continue to come to you.” So we made a decision not to allow that crawling, and then shortly thereafter we had to say, “Anytime you use AI on Vimeo, we’re going to actually guarantee that none of the AI models will improve based on your usage of it.” Unless you say, “Improve based on my usage, like understanding my storyline, my filters, my dialogue, or my style of dialogue,” we’ll do that for you as an individual creator. We’ll create your own private AI. We were actually approached as well to say, “Listen, we need you.” A number of the creators said, “We want you to help us identify when content has been generated by AI.” We do a lot of business over in the EU, and so we said, “Yes, we’re going to do that as well.” The thing that I describe about AI… Back in the era of the production line, humans stopped being able to keep up in a lot of ways, and so we started creating robots. We started creating machines that turned on screws and so forth. And next year at this time, there’s going to be more information created in the next year than there has in the history of mankind coming up until this point. Humans are struggling to keep up with a production line of information. So we’ve invented these machines. I also think AI is going to help us identify these things. It will help us filter and help us be able to say, “This is AI generated,” or “This content cannot be verified from the source.” We have to do some work around what we call KYC or know your creator. In some jurisdictions that we operate in, we have to actually say, “Yes, this is a human being that created this, this is the company that created this.” I actually think we have an opportunity to serve as that — like “Yes, this was created by a real human,” which actually stands out in a world of robots. So I think there are a lot of opportunities to protect the viewer and the creator, as well as serve them in helping produce stories faster. I want to ask one more foundational question about AI. There’s a lot of talk about cost right now in the AI world. There’s DeepSeek, which might have brought down the cost of training. There’s an argument about whether the cost of inference will drop. At the same time, Sam Altman is saying he’s going to build $500 billion worth of data centers all around the world with SoftBank. You use these tools, right? You’re deploying these tools against some large data sets in video, which is where the costs tend to go up the fastest. Where do you think that is? Is that working out for you? Are you making more money on the use of AI than you’re spending on it right now? The short answer is yes. I would tell you that I expect the cost of inference to drop dramatically. We were experimenting with some of the exact same things that DeepSeek claimed to do, to be able to use really low-cost chips to be able to do inference. And I do expect inference… the cost of inference is going to go through the floor. I used to joke to say, “If I need to order a Frosty and a double burger at Wendy’s, I don’t need to wade through all of Taylor Swift’s boyfriends and songs to be able to get through that.” So distillations of models to be able to serve at the exact moment of time that’s necessary, whatever the language or the function is. I think that you’re going to see that distillation will help us with this. The most recent Blackwell chips from Nvidia were about four times more efficient. Lighter weight models are super important to us. So we’re going to solve a lot of the inference problems and the cost associated with inference. I’m seeing it drop dramatically for what we do, and so it’ll be very manageable over time. I think that the real big cost for a lot of these companies is the training of some of this stuff, and that is going to come in line as well. We’ll get to a point of diminishing returns, like do you really need to go to 10 trillion-parameter models, or do you need something that’s just lighter weight to be able to do chemistry, biology, security, or coloration, as an example? I think, right now, we’re in the era of big models, and I don’t think that’ll last. Do you think we need to spend $500 billion on data centers all around the world? We need to lay down a new infrastructure of silicon. The silicon that’s around the world right now is highly optimized for general compute, and this is a new mathematical model that has to be supported with silicon. Otherwise, we’d actually consume more power if we didn’t have specialized chips that run this math equation. So all that’s happening right now is that, yes, we need to run our current compute and now we have a new algorithm we have to run. We’re going to need optimized silicon to be able to run that extra algorithm. So the short answer is that we actually do have to duplicate the silicon around the world. Is that something that you can drive at Vimeo? We talked about needing to serve 8K and the price of storage and compute for those falling on a pretty predictable basis. We need to invent new silicon to support AI workloads. That’s like a whole industry effort, right? And the pressure is all on maybe a handful of companies in one foundry to pull that off. How do you make those bets? I would tell you that we’re doing a lot in evaluating quality across a whole spectrum. One of the things that, as I said to you at the very start, we’re obsessing about is how our creators really want to use AI. They don’t want to be replaced and all this. And so what we’re doing is we’re picking each one of these areas and actually establishing quality frameworks inside of Vimeo — I almost said Google — inside of Vimeo where we’re saying, “Hey, this is high-quality translation,” or, “This is what we need to do to be able to support understanding what changed frame to frame.” And so a lot of what we’re doing is that we’re saying, “Okay, what’s the best model for the job that our creators are going to need to get done?” And then under the surface, we’re stitching all that together so the creator doesn’t even know there might be multiple models that are supporting them. We’ve established quality and then also handoffs for that creator because, as I said to you, we’re creating AI that’s going to be unique to that creator. And so we’re going to remember whether it’s over here in the translation world, over in asking a question, indexing, or otherwise. We stitch it all together for the creator so they don’t even know that we might be using multiple AI, but it’s establishing quality bars for each one of those things. And then also economics — making sure we get the best economics and best performance, like queries per second from the model providers for that area so they can serve our massive minutes of video and number of creators. We’re managing performance, cost, and quality on behalf of the creator across multiple models. Well, Philip, as you can probably tell, I could talk to you forever, but we are out of time. What’s next for Vimeo? Give people a preview of what’s coming up next and we’ll let you get out of here. I’m probably most excited right now, as I mentioned to you, about the massive formats that are coming at the creator. I’m super excited about what can be done with immersive formats. I’m also starting to see a lot of people who want to go back into these sphere-like experiences. I do think that that’s going to be exciting and you’ll see us continue to push the edge there. You’re going to see us invest more in the filmmaking community. Literally on Monday, I’m headed over to the Berlin Film Festival after hopefully, my Philadelphia Eagles do well in the Super Bowl. So you’re going to see us do even more around staff picks and celebrating filmmakers in every geography we serve around the world. I mean, it’s been fairly US-centric, and you’re going to see us get a lot more global in supporting filmmakers. Also, I would tell you as we look over at our enterprise customers, we think we can support customers in their customer journey. This mass proliferation of video across every part of the organization in the service of customers. We’re going to do really well at just-in-time video serving just the right video to just the right person at just the right moment of the customer interaction. So you’ll see us really come out with some exciting things about that between the format and the AI, things we can do to transform storytelling. Amazing. Well, we’ll have to have you back when we do just-in-time immersive video, AKA to both eyes at the same time. Phil, thanks. That’d be amazing. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode?

Title: Week Ahead: Busy Week On Wall Street

Time Published: 2025-02-24T14:49:16Z

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 16: People walk past the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 16, 2023 ... [+] in New York City. Stocks fell again in morning trading as investors continue to show concerns over the stability of global banks following the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) As Wall Street kicks off the final week of February 2025, investors are bracing for a busy week of data. I watch the news but I pay more attention to how the market reacts to the news. Remember, there are only three ways the market can move: up, down or sideways. A market that can’t fall on bearish news is bullish. The opposite is also true. Moreover, we all make (and or lose) money based on one thing: change in price. If the price moves in our favor (up if we are long and down if we are short) than we make money. If the price moves against us, we lose money. Everything else, including the latest headlines du jour comes second. For me, that’s why the reaction to the news matters more than the news itself. That doesn’t mean the news doesn’t matter, it does. The key is to focus on how the market reacts to the news and adjust accordingly. First, let’s look at the day-to-day breakdown and some of the big events happening this week: Monday, February 24: Earnings season keeps rolling with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Owens Corning (OC), and Zoom Communications (ZM) reporting. Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) is also on tap—could give us a read on industrial demand. No major economic data today, so the focus is on these corporate updates. Tuesday, February 25: Big day—Home Depot (HD) reports, offering a window into consumer spending and housing trends. We’ve also got American Tower (AMT), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY). Plus, February Consumer Confidence drops—last month it hit a low, so any bounce could lift spirits. Wednesday, February 26: Heavyweight day for tech and retail—Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM), and Snowflake (SNOW) report, which could swing the Nasdaq. Lowe’s (LOW) and TJX (TJX) give us more consumer clues. January New Home Sales data lands too—watch for housing momentum. Thursday, February 27: GDP second estimate for Q4 hits, alongside durable goods and pending home sales for January. On the earnings front, Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) report—tech’s still in the spotlight. Royal Bank of Canada (RY) and TD Bank (TD) could signal financial sector health. Friday, February 28: Is the last trading day in February. We wrap the week with January PCE price index—the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge—plus personal income and spending data. Earnings from Chart Industries (GTLS) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) close out a busy earnings week. Markets will be digesting all this ahead of the weekend. Political News: Second, let’s step back and look at the different news that we expect to hit the tape this week. First, we have the always fun political news. Investors will want to see the latest developments and what will happen with tariffs. Last month, Canada and Mexico managed to get a one month extension. Investors will want to see if they get another extension or if they can reach a deal to get rid of tariffs. In early February, U.S. stocks sold off after the tariffs were announced. We’ll see what happens in March. Economic News: Next up we have a flurry of economic news. As mentioned above, on Tuesday we have the Consumer Confidence Index. That will offer a fresh perspective on household optimism, a critical driver of consumer spending. It is important to note that consumer spending makes up over 75% of the economy. That’s why focusing on the consumer is important to make sense of what the rest of 2025 will look like. On Wednesday, Nvidia reports earnings and we will get more economic data. Nvidia is considered the big artificial intelligence darling on Wall Street. If it gaps up and rallies, that will bode well for other AI and tech stocks. On the other hand, if it rolls over and falls, that could put pressure on the market. On the economic front, durable goods orders are going to be released. That could signal whether businesses are ramping up spending or cutting back. Thursday brings international news with preliminary inflation figures from major Eurozone economies: Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, among others. Inflation has been public enemy #1 for many global central banks so that will be important going forward. We also have the second estimate for U.S. GDP. In the U.S., we get a sneak peak at inflation on Friday when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is announced. The PCE is one of the important metrics the Federal Reserve looks at each month. We will also get the personal income and spending figures; a hotter-than-expected PCE could cut hopes for near-term rate cuts, while slowing spending might hint at an economic slowdown. Together, these releases will test the narrative of a robust U.S. economy against lingering inflation risks, offering clues on whether stocks can sustain their lofty heights or face a reality check. What It Means For Investors Investors will want to see who will win this week, the bulls or the bears. If we get a big up week, that means the bulls win. Conversely, if we roll over and see more selling pressure (a.k.a. distribution) show up, the bears will emerge victorious. As February draws to a close, this week’s heavy data and earnings will test global markets. Bulls will point to resilient earnings and lower central-bank rates as fuel for further gains; bears will highlight inflation risks and policy uncertainty. By Friday’s close, we’ll have a clearer picture of what the rest of 2025 may look like. As always, it is never a dull moment on Wall Street. Disclaimer: I have a position in NVDA and it is featured in my FindLeadingStocks.com report.

Title: An advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. It's now proving to be a liability.

What did you do last week? Sorry to be so blunt, but federal workers are grappling with that question. DOGE sent an email this weekend asking government employees to list their recent accomplishments before midnight tonight. Many told BI they feel frustrated by the request. The Department of Defense, meanwhile, instructed staff not to respond. In today's big story, getting an advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. Now, it's proving to be a liability on your résumé. What's on deck Markets: The takeaways from Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Tech: A former big-time Elon Musk believer makes the case for why Tesla is in trouble this year. Business: The Russian media oligarch pushing Putin to even further extremes. But first, school's out forever. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Their degrees were something for them to fall back on. Instead, they're in a free fall. Job seekers with advanced degrees are having a much harder time finding work compared to their less-educated peers, writes Business Insider's Aki Ito. These days, you're better off with just a high school diploma instead of a Ph.D. if you want to find work fast. People who didn't go to college can get work twice as quickly as those with advanced degrees. (Let's be clear: Advanced-degree holders still largely rule the roost on compensation. But pay only matters once you have a job.) Aki has previously written about the struggles of white-collar workers thanks to hiring reductions among tech and finance firms. Those are common landing spots for people with advanced degrees, which might be why extra education isn't paying off in the job hunt. However, Aki's story explores whether the labor market's latest shift could signal a bigger change in the importance of education. All of this is also happening at a time when colleges are facing a reckoning. Some say you can't put a price on education, but universities have certainly tried. With the cost of a four-year degree at a private college easily surpassing $250,000, more and more young people are questioning the benefits of college, let alone grad school. Another corner of the job market that was once a sure thing is also getting shaken up. Government jobs, traditionally considered a stable paycheck with good benefits, have been upended by the Trump administration. (Just reread the intro to this newsletter if you need a recent example.) Tens of thousands of employees took buyouts, and thousands of probationary workers were fired during the first month of the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting efforts.It's still unclear the impact these job cuts will have on the wider labor market. But continuing to make wholesale changes to the largest employer in the US, which is known for its job security, will likely have some residual effect. 1. Warren Buffett's tax bill was a doozy. Berkshire Hathaway, the legendary investor's conglomerate, paid a record $26.8 billion in taxes last year, Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. It's the most paid by any US company in history and represents about 5% of total American corporate income taxes paid in 2024. "Spend it wisely," Buffett wrote. The letter also included some more fundamental business — and life — lessons, too. 2. The meme coin explosion. Once an obscure corner of crypto, meme coins have taken on a life — and market — of their own. But scams are common with meme coins, and ongoing conversations about a regulatory path are another big question mark. 3. How a hedge fund repays $1.2 billion to investors heading for the exits. The past few years have been rocky for Paloma Partners, posting just a 2.5% return in 2024. The multistrategy hedge fund said last fall it would take time to repay departing investors. To meet redemption requests, Paloma plans to pull $600 million from hedge funds it backed, including the quant firm Aquatic Capital, according to four people familiar with the matter. 1. An early Tesla investor is now bearish on the stock. Ross Gerber was among the first to spot Tesla's potential, but he isn't feeling so confident now. Gerber doubts the company can achieve Full Self-Driving on time without switching hardware, and he believes Elon Musk has too many pots in the fire. 2. We're hiring … just not humans. Originally created as an experiment, two founders built a jobs board for AI agents. The jobs board, dubbed "Job for Agent," provides insight into what companies might look for in an AI workforce. 3. AI bosses feel the pressure. In a recent interview, the CEOs of Google DeepMind and Anthropic spoke about the weight of responsibility that comes with ushering in AI. The leaders urged people to better grasp the real force for change they expect AI to be — and for societies to start planning accordingly. 1. The oligarch who wants to "Make Russia Great Again." There is one Russian nationalist currently in the spotlight who may be even more zealous than Vladimir Putin. Konstantin Malofeyev operates Tsargrad, a multimedia platform with over three million followers. He embraces Trumpian rhetoric and helped organize the Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's Donbas region, paving the way for Putin's invasion. But Malofeyev thinks Putin isn't doing enough to crush Ukraine. 2. Scaredy-cat capitalism in the new Trump era. While deregulation and tax cuts are generally favored by corporate America, Trump and his policies aren't exactly predictable. That's leading some companies — from Meta to Disney — to brace for his whims. Many businesses are trying to get in Trump's good graces by cutting back on DEI and handing over a check. 3. You might be waiting on your tax return this year. The Internal Revenue Service began firing probationary workers last week who were not "critical" to tax filing season. These terminations are part of Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce, but it could result in more backlogs, slower customer service, and delayed refunds, tax experts and IRS employees told BI. An IRS HR employee said the firings, coupled with a hiring freeze, could set the agency behind on its functions well into 2026.

Crypto Daybook Americas will arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin and ether, the two largest digital assets by market value, remain largely within their recent trading ranges two days after the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges. Perpetual funding rates for both are positive, indicating a bias for long positions that benefit from price rises. Bitcoin options trading on Deribit show a bullish bias for call options across all time frames, while those tied to ether show a downside bias into March. The bias for ether puts, however, has been present since well before the hack. Meanwhile, Volmex Finance's 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index has dropped to an annualized 48.45%, the lowest since July, according to charting platform TradingView. Ether's implied volatility has reversed the minor weekend spike from 67% to 70%. The calm is a sign of market maturity, according to QCP Capital. "The price action underscores the growing maturity of the crypto landscape since the FTX collapse in 2022, particularly in the crypto credit market," the trading firm said. "Every facet of crypto — from custodial and security solutions to corporate governance and transparency — has strengthened with each past crisis." Overall, the crypto community is reassured by Bybit’s ability to manage over $6 billion in withdrawals following the hack. Plus, the exchange has filled the gap in its ETH reserves. According to Mena Theodorou, a co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, all eyes will be on Solana's SOL as Franklin Templeton, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has submitted a spot SOL ETF proposal to the SEC. In addition, 11.2 million SOL (2.3% of total supply) from the FTX estate are scheduled to be unlocked on March 1, which could breed market volatility. That has already boosted volume in SOL put options on Deribit. President Donald Trump's decision to audit gold reserves at Fort Knox in Kentucky has piqued interest in the crypto community. "While routine gold audits are rare, the timing is notable as Trump continues to push a pro-crypto narrative. If the gold supply turns out to be lower than expected, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s case as digital gold — and possibly even as a superior reserve asset," Theodorou said in an email. In traditional markets, the yen continues to gain ground against the U.S. dollar and growth-sensitive commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar, calling for caution on the part of the risk asset bulls.

The Nvidia Corporation logo, the American multinational corporation and technology company that ... [+] designs and supplies graphics processing units, application programming interfaces, and high-performance computing, appears on a MacBook in Barcelona, Spain, on February 10, 2025. (Photo by Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nvidia, the $3 Trillion AI posterchild, is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday, February 26. The company will likely continue to report robust demand for its products and a compelling outlook. The stock is likely to pop - per our data on how Nvidia reacts post earnings. However, there is a larger risk to the US economy, worth factoring right now. What is that? See more on Trefis.com Inflation fears have subsided, but not extinguished. If anything, Trump’s bold moves on tariffs and immigration have stoked fears of an inflation restart. All of this means the US economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession - our analysis here on the macro picture and below we describe what it could mean for Nvidia. When you factor in a higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration - these are critical risks. After all, trade is uncertain, and everyone - including Canada, Mexico, and Europe - longtime allies are now called to the negotiating table. NVDA stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the last 3 economic downturns. Inflation Shock (Jan 2022 to May 2023) • NVDA stock fell 66% from a high of $33 on 19 November 2021 to $11 on 14 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-inflation shock peak by 25 May 2023 - taking 154 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 317 days • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and currently trades at around $135. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like NVIDIA, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. • NVDA stock fell 37.6% from a high of $7.83 on 19 February 2020 to $4.89 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 11 May 2020 - taking 56 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days. • During the 2007-09 recession, NVDA stock fell from a peak value of $0.91 on 17 October 2007 to $0.14 on 20 November 2008 a decline of 85.1% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500) • However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 27 April 2016 - taking 2715 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. Not too happy about the volatile nature of NVDA stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images In the summer of 2024, I noted that the stock market was likely to move higher. However, the big tech leaders were seen as too extended and overvalued. This group was due for a correction. If the market was to move higher and the tech leaders were to correct, then other lagging stocks would have to start outperforming, which has been the case. Let us take a closer look. The relative strength of the equally-weighted NASDAQ versus the S&P 500 turned up in late December and remains strong. This indicates that the average stock in the NASDAQ 100 is stronger than the cap-weighted S&P 500. The big-cap tech stocks have been lagging while the smaller weights in the index have been rising. The result: Many more stocks are rising but the equities that have the greatest influence on the indices have lagged. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in 2024 in which only 25% of the stocks outperformed the S&P 500. Note the rising relative strength as denoted by the green line. The relative strength screen shows that within the NASDAQ 100, the big eight tech stocks are ranked from No. 6 (Netflix) to No. 75 (Microsoft). Here are the stocks in relative strength order with the cycles recommendations in parentheses: Netflix (hold) Meta Platforms (sell) Tesla (buy) Nvidia (sell) Amazon (sell) Apple (hold) Google (sell) Microsoft (cycle low in March) This monthly cycle graph explains the buy signal on Tesla. This accurate monthly cycle points to higher prices through 2025. Here is another graph that explains the sell opinion on Nvidia: This cycle peaked at the price high and points down though the year. The top five NASDAQ current relative performers are: 1. Palantir 2. Super Micro Systems 3. Axon 4. Atlassian 5. DoorDash Some of these stocks are extremely overbought and too risky to buy now. From these new leaders, here are two stocks that can be added to portfolios. Super Micro came down hard, and is now giving longer-term buy signals, supported by rising cycles. There are weekly buy signals and a very oversold monthly price. Atlassian features technical strength and a rising monthly cycle. Use the pullback in this cycle and any NASDAQ weakness to accumulate shares. The cycle rises from March to June.

Title: Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #632

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Nobody’s honest. Scientists are not honest. And people usually believe that they are. That makes it worse. By honest I don’t mean that you only tell what’s true. But you make clear the entire situation. You make clear all the information that is required for somebody else who is intelligent to make up their mind” — Richard Feynman “The Unscientific Age”, The Meaning of It All (1998) Number of the Week: 29,000 THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW will continue with questioning whether climate science is a physical science. TWTW begins with a discussion of omitting physical evidence by the UN IPCC. Then it discusses the importance of the Greenhouse Effect. TWTW discusses a report that Earth’s albedo is changing. Then it discusses a report by Ross McKitrick that some advocates of the so-called social cost of carbon omitted key evidence. A controversy at the Royal Society is discussed, followed by an essay by David Legates explaining why the vaunted Hydrogen Economy is not materializing. TWTW concludes with a discussion on the failure of the green energy transition. ********************* Is It Science? For years, organizations have used the term science to sanctify their political actions. Some of these organizations even have the term science in their names, others are government organizations funded with the intent for providing physical evidence for certain concerns, such as weather. Most researchers are no doubt scrupulous, but some, such as James Hansen, may deceive themselves. Others seek funding for advancement and to profit from it. But in physical science the ultimate and final judge, nature, is impartial. All ideas and theories must be tested against what nature reveals to us, physical evidence from observation and experiment. To SEPP this is what is meant by applying the scientific method. And those ideas and theories which fail to meet the test must be discarded. Unfortunately, a common practice among researchers who are less than scrupulous is omitting data (physical evidence) that contradicts the desired conclusion. As Stephen McIntyre has demonstrated repeatedly, this practice was common to the so-called hockey-stick. It was featured in the reports of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [particularly the Third Assessment Report (AR3 or TAR, 2001)]. [The cover of the TAR Synthesis Report: Summary for Policymakers has been altered in recent versions, however the hockey-stick style shape (of roughly stable temperatures between the year 1000 to 1900 then sharply increasing temperatures and projections thereafter to 2100) can be seen in Figure SPM-10b: Variations of the Earth’s surface temperature: years 1000 to 2100.] Click to access spm.pdf To call such reports “science” is misleading. It is not physical science and some of the findings are contradicted by physical evidence. The contradicting physical evidence is omitted in such reports. However, it is common practice in the political game called “science” to label such reports as “science” — without mentioning the omitted physical evidence. This game is commonly practiced in the US and Europe. The integrity of all of physical science is tarnished by such efforts. *********************** Importance of the Greenhouse Effect: The UN IPCC and its collaborators have condemned carbon dioxide by speculating about possible harmful effects of increasing carbon dioxide and its greenhouse effect. Their publications seldom mention the benefits of the primary greenhouse gas, water vapor, without which we probably would not have life on Earth. Nor do they mention the benefits of the secondary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, which is essential for providing carbohydrates, the food source for all complex plants and animals. Their publications omit any benefits of the greenhouse effect itself. Starting with experiments in 1859, John Tyndall was the first to produce evidence that what he called greenhouse gases are critical for life on Earth. Without them the land masses of Earth would become too cold at night to support life as we know it. Growing plants would freeze every night. To understand the importance of the greenhouse effect for life, one needs only to compare the temperatures on Mars with those on Earth. Mars is about 1.5 times farther from the Sun than Earth. Thus, the solar radiant energy hitting it is less intense. But Earth has an albedo (reflective power) of about 30% reflecting solar radiation back to space, primarily from clouds and ice. Mars has an average albedo of around 16% primarily from dust and the composition of its surface. The daily rotation of Mars is about 24 hours and 37 minutes, a little less than 40 minutes longer than that of Earth. But it is the temperature range at the equator that is interesting. At the equator on Earth, the average daytime temperature is about 31°C (88°F). The average nighttime temperature is about 23°C (73°F). Thus, the average temperature range between daytime and nighttime is about 8°C (15°F). [Note there are other estimates that tend to give a smaller range.] At the equator on Mars daytime temperatures are around 20°C (70°F); the average nighttime temperature is about minus 70 °C (-94°F). Obviously, such cold on Earth would kill growing plants. Furthermore, although the atmosphere on Mars is thin, it is about 95% carbon dioxide. So, the runaway greenhouse effect is not occurring. https://www.space.com/16907-what-is-the-temperature-of-mars.html Some researchers such Carl Sagan falsely assumed such an effect is occurring on Venus. The overwhelming amount of the atmosphere on Venus is greenhouse gases, and the atmospheric pressure is about 92 times that on earth. If we had Venus’s quantity of greenhouse gases, they would amount to: CO2, 89,000,000 ppm (in other words 89 times our atmosphere in-toto; sulfur dioxide (SO2), 13,800 ppm; H2O, 1840 ppm, carbon monoxide (CO) 1560 ppm; hydrogen chloride (HCl), 30 ppm. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus The Greenhouse Effect is vital for life on Earth; without it the planet would be too cold to support life. Further, the two significant greenhouse gases, water vapor and carbon dioxide along with sunlight for photosynthesis provide carbohydrates (simple sugars), the food source for all complex plants and animals. Thanks to modern technology, we are measuring the greenhouse effect in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Calculations of the greenhouse effect by van Wijngaarden and Happer using the HITRAN database agree well with measurements at various latitudes made by satellites. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer *********************** Earth’s Changing Albedo? In August, Geomatics published a paper by Ned Nikolov and Karl F. Zeller titled “Roles of Earth’s Albedo Variations and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in Recent Warming: New Insights from Satellite and Surface Observations.” The abstract states: “Past studies have reported a decreasing planetary albedo and an increasing absorption of solar radiation by Earth since the early 1980s, and especially since 2000. This should have contributed to the observed surface warming. However, the magnitude of such solar contribution is presently unknown, and the question of whether or not an enhanced uptake of shortwave energy by the planet represents positive feedback to an initial warming induced by rising greenhouse-gas concentrations has not conclusively been answered. The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also did not properly assess this issue. Here, we quantify the effect of the observed albedo decrease on Earth’s Global Surface Air Temperature (GSAT) since 2000 using measurements by the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project and a novel climate-sensitivity model derived from independent NASA planetary data by employing objective rules of calculus. Our analysis revealed that the observed decrease of planetary albedo along with reported variations of the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) explain 100% of the global warming trend and 83% of the GSAT interannual variability as documented by six satellite- and ground-based monitoring systems over the past 24 years. Changes in Earth’s cloud albedo emerged as the dominant driver of GSAT, while TSI only played a marginal role. The new climate sensitivity model also helped us analyze the physical nature of the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) calculated as a difference between absorbed shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere. Observations and model calculations revealed that EEI results from a quasi-adiabatic attenuation of surface energy fluxes traveling through a field of decreasing air pressure with altitude. In other words, the adiabatic dissipation of thermal kinetic energy in ascending air parcels gives rise to an apparent EEI, which does not represent “heat trapping” by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases as currently assumed. We provide numerical evidence that the observed EEI has been misinterpreted as a source of energy gain by the Earth system on multidecadal time scales.” [Boldface added] In other words, the increase in warming that has occurred since 2000 may be from a small decrease in cloudiness, not from an increase in CO2. The CERES project, designed to measure the earth’s energy imbalance by measuring solar intensity, albedo, and outgoing IR, concluded that the “Large ASR [Absorbed Solar Radiation] trend [is] primarily driven by reductions in low and middle clouds. (https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/documents/STM/2023-05/15_Loeb Contributed_Science_Presentation_2023.pdf) As explained by AMO physicists William van Wijngaarden and William Happer, a 1% decrease in cloudiness can cause a warming equal to that of a doubling in CO2. Further, John Robson discusses a paper by Swiss scientists suggesting sunlight hitting the earth is increasing, first from a reduction in Soviet era pollution, then from an overall decrease in cloudiness. [Robson did not link to the paper.] See links under Science: Is the Sun Rising? and Commentary: Is the Sun Rising? *********************** More Omissions: During the Biden Administration a group of economists decided to increase the mythical Social Cost of Carbon (Dioxide) (SCC). Econometrician Ross McKitrick examined their work and wrote a paper “Extended crop yield meta-analysis data do not support upward SCC revision” published by Nature, Scientific Reports. The abstract states: “The Biden Administration raised its Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimate about fivefold based in part on global crop yield decline projections estimated on a meta-analysis data base first published in 2014. The data set contains 1722 records, but half were missing at least one variable (usually the change in CO2) so only 862 were available for multivariate regression modeling. By re-examining the underlying sources, I was able to recover 360 records and increase the sample size to 1222. Reanalysis on the larger data set yields very different results. While the original smaller data set implies yield declines of all crop types even at low levels of warming, on the full data set global average yield changes are zero or positive even out to 5 °C warming.” [Boldface added] Judith Curry’s Climate Etc. had a post by McKitrick which explains his work in some detail. The background sections states: “In 2023 a team of economists working for the Biden Administration concluded the SCC needed to be increased by a considerable amount. The higher the SCC, the costlier the regulatory burden that can be justified by the agency. This not only affected US regulations but Canada’s as well since our own environment ministry adopted the new US values when justifying a sweeping set of new greenhouse gas regulations. I wrote an op-ed about the SCC change in May 2023 in which I drew attention to the important role played by a revision to projected agricultural yield damages. While it is difficult to trace where, precisely, all the changes came from, I estimate about $50 of an approximately $100 increase in the 2030 value of the SCC (holding the discount rate constant) was attributable to the revised agricultural yield damage estimates. These revisions were attributed to estimates of crop yield losses from a 2017 paper published in Nature Communications by Frances Moore et al. called “New science of climate change impacts on agriculture implies higher social cost of carbon.” I’ll call that paper M17. I was familiar with this paper because Kevin Dayaratna and I had studied it while preparing a response to a comment by Philip Meyer on a paper of ours on the SCC. I knew, for instance, that M17 used a data set originally developed for a 2014 paper published in Nature Climate Change by Andy Challinor et al. called “A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation.” I’ll refer to that one as C14. But C14 and M17 had different implications about the impact of CO2-induced warming on crop yields. In the C14 model CO2 fertilization offsets the damage from warming, whereas in M17 the combined effect is negative for most crops across most warming paths. So why the difference? It was not possible to tell simply by reading the papers. Neither one provided a detailed explanation of its regression analysis. M17, in particular, did not report its regression results nor was its model directly comparable to C14. So, in 2023 I decided to get the data and try to replicate both sets of findings. While both papers said the data was available online at a website called http://www.ag-impacts.org no such site currently exists, and the Wayback machine entries did not include any data. I emailed Moore to ask for her data, but she was at that time working for the Biden Administration and her university email was inactive. I then reached out to Challinor who replied promptly and sent me his data set.” McKitrick explains the misleading dataset he terms as C14. He then explains the slow review process in which his paper was rejected by Nature Climate Change and the slow review by Nature Scientific Reports. The paper was finally published by Nature Scientific Reports on February 15, after the new US administration took office. McKitrick states: “Of course, the topic has now been rendered somewhat moot by the Trump Administration’s January 20 Executive Order suspending the SCC on the grounds that it is “marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation.” The EPA has until mid-March to issue guidance on how to address these problems including possibly scraping the use of the SCC altogether. I have had no contact with people working on that undertaking but if any of them were to ask me I would tell them the following. Measuring the SCC is not a scientific procedure akin to measuring the weight of an atom or the speed of light. The SCC is based on so-called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that contain countless assumptions and yield complicated “if-then” statements. If the following assumptions are true, then a ton of CO2 emissions will cause $X worth of damage to the world. Whoever gets to pick the “If” statements determine what the “then” statement will be. And you can pick studies that guarantee any SCC value you like, although some are more plausible than others. Ultimately the SCC is determined by the political and social process of choosing who gets to write the report. The Biden-era SCC report was written by people whose antennae were up for any reasons whatsoever to boost the SCC estimate, and who ignored evidence pointing in the other direction. The report even warns the reader that they probably overlooked many reasons why the SCC is even higher than they have estimated because surely there are many other damages associated with CO2 that they have not yet thought of. (They claimed to have taken account of the benefits associated with CO2 fertilization in one of their two IAMs, but they did so based on the M17 analysis. Which means, in effect, they didn’t take it into account.) From an economic perspective, the dirty little secret of climate policy is that CO2 emission reductions are so costly, even if the US government accepted the Biden SCC estimate very few climate policies would survive a cost-benefit test, and if the SCC were lowered to something more reasonable none of them would. So, in that sense climate activists will get no joy from hanging onto the SCC. But beyond the question of what the magic SCC number should be, the bigger question is how you convince a bureaucracy not to rig the report-writing process. The 2013 Interagency Working Group SCC report boasted of consulting 11 separate government agencies, and the 2023 report additionally boasted of input from the National Academies of Science and outside expert reviewers. Yawn. The more agencies involved the less scrutiny a report gets. It is all but certain that no one checked any underlying data or undertook any replication work. And I know from experience in the IPCC and other bureaucratic processes that review comments going against a chapter author’s biases are ignored or argued away, while comments confirming an author’s biases are welcomed at face value. The scientific establishment has resisted all attempts to fix climate assessment processes because they always got to pick the authors. But now a very different team is going to do the picking. If the establishment grandees suddenly decide they don’t like the process, they should have said something sooner.”[Boldface added] See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy *********************** Which Science? Episodes such as the one experienced by McKitrick prompt one to ask: when organizations speak of science, what type of science are they referring to: Is it the science of using the scientific method to test all ideas against nature, or the science of omitting key physical evidence that contradicts the proposed idea or theory? The Royal Society is the oldest science society in the world. Elon Musk is a fellow. Jo Nova links to an article in the journal Nature which states; “The Royal Society in London has called a meeting to discuss the behavior of fellows after a growing campaign by scientists over the membership of Elon Musk. The meeting, scheduled for 3 March, comes after more than 1,300 scientists signed an open letter expressing “deep concerns” about the conduct of billionaire Musk, who is a fellow. Musk is working closely with US President Donald Trump on sweeping government reforms that threaten flagship US research programs and are causing havoc for scientists in the United States and globally. He is also accused of spreading misinformation on the social-media site X, which he owns. Two Royal Society fellows have resigned over the institution’s perceived lack of action over Musk’s behavior in recent months. ‘It is tarnishing their reputation and to some degree devalues the honor of awarding fellowships. Does one want to be associated to a society that does not stand up for its values?’ says Stephen Curry, a retired structural biologist at Imperial College London, who wrote the letter and published it on his blog on 11 February.” The Imperial College London harbors World Weather Attribution (WWA) which without physical evidence attributes severe weather events to increasing carbon dioxide. Further, Musk and his team are exposing significant funding of highly questionable political organizations in the name of science. The question is, which type of science are these members defending: the science that tests all ideas against physical evidence? or the “science” that omits key physical evidence to make a political assertion? Nova writes: “The Royal Society acts every day more and more like a trade union for approved priests of science. They reveal their small mindedness in so many ways. They accuse Musk of ‘attacking public sciences’ which begs the question of what a public science is? Is that different to real science? Or has the Royal Society totally forgotten that science is a process and not a government institution? The original full name of the Society was ‘The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge’ and no one on Earth is doing more to improve natural knowledge than Elon Musk is. And the reason he can do so much, so fast, is surely because he is funding it all himself, not waiting for government approval, appeasing bureaucrats, or cringing before ‘science’ committees with magical fashionable keywords like diversity. Musk should quit the Royal Society because it has forgotten what science is The Royal Society doesn’t know it, but they desperately need Elon Musk. The Royal Society has become nothing more than a workers’ union for government funded technicians dressed in lab coats, and he’s the greatest private scientist in the world today. He is the antidote to government funded paralysis in science (and in so many ways). Consensus ‘scientists’ are just a paid marketing wing of Big Government — captured by the monopolistic funding. The Royal Society needs Elon much more than Elon needs the Royal Society. He should quit now, before they hold their sanctimonious meeting. *UPDATE: Quitting? Nah. It only makes the Thought Police happy. Unless he has the time to excoriate them properly on the way out, it’s so much better to let them dig their own hole in public, then come crawling back when he gets to Mars. Besides, Elon has 218 million followers on X – If he wanted to set up a Society of Scientists — ones who care about the scientific method, he could do it tomorrow.” See links under Lowering Standards and Funding Issues. *********************** Failed Magic Fuel: SEPP director David Legates, and member of the Cornwall Alliance, has an essay on Master Resource “Hydrogen Energy: Not Clean, Green, Cheap.” He clearly explains the major problems involved in attempting to use hydrogen as a fuel. First, on Earth it is not a fuel. There are no hydrogen mines or fields that can be drilled. It must be extracted from H2O, natural gas (primarily CH4,) or other hydrogen compounds, at considerable cost in energy. There is significant energy loss involved in production. Second it is difficult to store because it turns most metals brittle. Third, it is difficult to transport. Fourth, it is difficult to use, it is extremely explosive. Legates concludes with: “Not Cheap Finally, the fourth hurdle should now be obvious. The use of hydrogen as a fuel source is expensive—in terms of production cost, expensive storage, and energy required to produce. Hydrogen as a fuel source will allow virtue signalers to claim they have developed and are using a ‘clean and green’ fuel source that is ‘saving the planet from the evils of fossil fuels.’ But in reality, it is only going to make energy more expensive and send a larger proportion of the planet back below the poverty line. As we have often stated here at the Cornwall Alliance, inexpensive energy has been the solution to raising billions of people above the poverty line and increasing their standard of living. Hydrogen energy will cease to become viable when the subsidies provided to it by governments of the world dry up. Hopefully, the new Administration will recognize that hydrogen embrittlement applies not just to metals, but to our economy as well.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Article #1 for the bankruptcy of the electric and hydrogen truck manufacturer Nikola. *********************** An Unraveling: Planning Engineer Russ Schussler has an essay in Climate Etc. which takes apart the erroneous thinking behind the failing green energy transition. He writes: “The purpose of this article is to summarize and debunk many of the issues in the narrative surrounding the proposed green energy transition as applies to the electric grid. The issues are so numerous that this piece is at once both too long and too short. A full unraveling deserves a book or series of books. This posting, however, challenges the narrative through summary comments with links to previous posts and articles which can be read for a more detailed explanation or for greater depth. The Narrative Efforts to hasten a ‘green transition’ find support in a powerful and compelling narrative. The following statements are widely believed, embraced and supported by various ‘experts’, a large part of the public and far too many policy makers: Schussler then debunks these claims. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *********************** Number of the Week: 29,000 According to the German newspaper DW translated into English: Germany has expanded wind and solar energy but failed to cut back on fossil fuel use in the transport sector. Environmental issues did not feature prominently in the election campaign — unlike the last time around. The head of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz — who, according to the polls, is most likely to become the next German chancellor — has often said that Germany’s approximately 29,000 electricity-generating wind turbines are a thorn in his side. In November 2024, Merz told public broadcaster ZDF, “I even believe that if we do things right, we can one day dismantle the wind turbines again — because they are ugly.” When a high-pressure system settles over Northern Europe in the winter, producing cold, still nights; 29,000 turbines produce little electricity for Germany.

Conclusion The NCA can reform its current image as a political tool by presenting the total picture—considering both threats and opportunities, incorporating exposure and vulnerability into disaster cost analyses, leveraging systematic review methods, and communicating findings in an objective, data-centric manner. These reforms would not only make the report more useful but also allow it to be more robust to pendulum swings between administrations. [SEPP Comment: Under the current structure, it is doubtful that the United States Global Change Research Program’s (USGCRP) National Climate Assessment (NCA) is worth saving. Recent severe weather events probably have nothing to do with climate change.

By Rachel Cleetus, Policy Director with the Climate and Energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists, Feb 18, 2025 If Lee Zeldin is looking for a recent authoritative assessment of the science, he should turn to the 2023 Fifth US National Climate Assessment, produced under the direction of the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates that the USGCRP—which collaborates across 15 federal agencies—deliver a report to Congress and the President at least every four years. Another valuable source is the IPCC sixth assessment report, which reflects the work of thousands of scientists around the world—including many from the United States—in assessing the latest climate science, impacts, and opportunities to cut heat-trapping emissions and adapt to climate change.

Why is the US giving it billions of dollars? By Robert Bryce, His Blog, Feb 18, 2025 In 2013, the World Bank declared it would stop funding coal projects and would only “in rare circumstances” provide financial support for new coal plants. It also said it would “scale up efforts to improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy.” Rather than support coal projects, the bank said it would “scale up its work helping countries develop national and regional markets for natural gas, the fossil fuel with the lowest carbon intensity.” But two years later, the bank backtracked on natural gas and said it would stop all lending for oil and gas projects “except under exceptional circumstances.” Since then, the bank, which claims its “role is to reduce poverty by lending money to the governments of its poorer members to improve their economies and to improve the standard of living of their people,” has lost its collective mind.

They did a very, very small-scale [demonstration] of actual power beaming from orbit down to the surface a couple years ago. And what we’re actually seeing right now is that in the next five years, we’re going to have the first on-orbit power-beaming demonstrations, again, focusing on lasers, because that’s where a lot of the DOD interest is right now, and that’s where the actual funding is. But we’re going to see that you’ll have those initial demonstrators, and if you start having a market, especially for space-to-space power beaming, that could happen a lot sooner than people think, because you don’t need to have very large systems for that. Just having several kilowatts would be really helpful for certain types of applications.” [SEPP Comment: A possible source of power that may prove to be very practical in areas with few clouds, but a bit impractical perhaps for planes or birds passing through the intense beams. In the 60s (?) the idea was to beam down microwaves at about 200 W/m2, roughly 5% of that of a microwave oven, and covering large areas where the microwaves would be efficiently absorbed by “rectennas.”] Solar Energy Is Not Competitive with Fossil Fuels By Norman Rogers, Real Clear Energy, Feb 18, 2025 The size of power plants is often expressed by the maximum number of megawatts of power they are capable of delivering, called the nameplate rating. The average power delivery is less. For a natural gas plant, it is possible to generate an average power of near 100 percent of the nameplate. The plant can run continuously except for maintenance pauses. But for a solar plant the maximum capacity factor is about 25 percent in sunny areas.

Nikola’s EV Truck Dream Goes Bust Another green industrial-policy project enters Chapter 11. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, Feb. 19, 2025 TWTW Summary: The editorial begins with: “Another green-energy unicorn died Wednesday as Nikola Corp., the electric-truck startup, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its spectacular market crash is another warning about the perils of industrial policy and chasing government subsidies. The 11-year-old EV maker aspired to be the Tesla of trucks. Nikola went public in June 2020 through a blank-check merger amid the euphoric pandemic stock-market recovery and Democratic promises of a Green New Deal. It fetched a $27 billion market valuation that at the time was greater than Ford’s even though Nikola had sold no vehicles. Supposedly sophisticated investors were taken in by its marketing hype. General Motors announced on Sept. 8, 2020, that it was taking an 11% stake in Nikola, which CEO Mary Barra hailed as an “industry leading disrupter.” It was disruptive in a different way. In January 2018 Nikola posted a video on Twitter of its model truck appearing to power effortlessly down a flat road with the caption: “The Nikola Hydrogen Electric trucks will take on any semi-truck and outperform them in every category; weight, acceleration, stopping, safety and features—all with 500-1,000-mile range!” That would be a revolutionary—if true. It wasn’t. According to a 2021 federal fraud indictment of founder Trevor Milton, an inoperable prototype was towed to the top of a hill. Then Nikola employees released the brakes so it looked like it was cruising along. All the while the door was taped shut to keep it from falling off, and its batteries were removed to prevent the truck from catching fire. After taking investors for a ride, Mr. Milton was convicted in 2022. Nikola’s marketing deceptions and problems spooked investors. Nikola in 2023 recalled 209 battery-electric trucks owing to fires. As of last October, it had sold fewer than 500 trucks—and at a heavy loss. Nikola reportedly had sold hydrogen trucks for $351,000 — about half what it cost to produce them, though its sales price was still about twice as much as an internal-combustion-engine semi. This was financially unsustainable, especially amid higher interest rates. California regulators and the Biden Administration tried to boost the electric-truck market with mandates and subsidies. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a $40,000 tax credit for buyers of electric trucks. An Environmental Protection Agency rule last spring requires that electric models make up 25% of long-haul tractor sales by 2032. But the government still couldn’t induce truckers to buy them. “Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,” Nikola CEO Stephen Girsky said on Wednesday. Translation: High costs and technological limitations make EVs impractical for long-distance trucking operations.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Despite the tanking of the economy by divers means, mainly taxation, some are still prepared to engage in blatant doublethink. Recently Guido had this: “Rachel Reeves has been warned she must “urgently” boost the economy after her tax hikes triggered the sharpest collapse in business output and profits since the pandemic. A damning report from the CBI predicts another significant fall in private sector activity over the next three months (-23%), with the “pessimism widespread” https://order-order.com/2025/01/27/british-businesses-sees-biggest-hit-to-profit-and-output-since-covid/ That same CBI says… “Britain’s net zero economy is booming, CBI says Green sector growing at triple the rate of the UK economy, providing high-wage jobs and increasing energy security … The analysis showed economic growth and climate action go together, said the report’s authors, and improve lives and livelihoods. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/britain-net-zero-economy-booming-cbi-green-sector-jobs-energy-security On the one hand an economy going into needless recession and on the other a boom in green… To quote Rachel from Accounts: “There is no tradeoff between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century” And to quote John Lennon: “Just gimme some truth”. “Most researchers are no doubt scrupulous” I’m not this is true (any more). At every level they are encouraged to be less than truthful. This starts with funding proposals, in which they feel compelled to exaggerate, often wildly, the significance and impact of what they propose. The buzzwords change constantly, eg “paradigm shifting” becomes so yesterday and is replaced by “transformative” or some other vacuous term. The publication process has become a game. It is not to be taken seriously. It’s difficult to get informed, balanced, intelligent reviews any more in most journals, especially the interdisciplinary journals. Reviewers are often antagonistic for no reason, frequently ignorant of the techniques employed, and unable to judge the merits or spot fundamental flaws. This makes the process somewhat of a lottery, with of course some biases. Editors don’t by and large make editorial decisions any longer. They hide behind reviewers without bothering to make sense of comments and responses themselves. With the right recipe in terms of topic, techniques and writing style, it’s perfectly possible to get papers into top journals often by simply bamboozling reviewers with technical jargon and exaggerated claims. Just keep submitting and some will slip through. If you look more closely, you will find most papers suffer from outright fakery or data manipulation, or lies by omission. For example, there are countless papers in so called top journals like Nature using machine learning, especially deep learning, in which it is obvious that the authors don’t understand the techniques, have applied them to ill suited problems, and have misinterpreted or manipulated the results. This sort of thing would be resoundingly mocked by a specialist journal as an example of what not to do. Do the authors know what they’re doing? Of course they do. The PhDs, postdocs and supervisors are all aware that they shouldn’t be using techniques they don’t fully understand, but they do it anyway to ride the the latest fashion. By the way, I don’t blame the junior ones too much, this is the culture in which they’ve been trained and come of age . This is the sort of dishonesty that is most common, and it is rife. The more serious dishonesty (plagiarism, fake data) is much rarer. The entire academic system from the focus on funding over scholarship to the corruption of journals and scientific bodies will not be easily fixed. I don’t see how it can be. Academia has attracted and awarded the wrong sort of person in the past 20 years or more. The non scholar, a natural manager rather than a researcher. These types are in charge of universities, journals editorial boards and scientific panels and bodies. These people got to where they are by focusing on the things universities value (money), moving in the right circles, timing their bandwagon jumping to perfection and by exploiting the talents of others. They have redifined what it is to be a scientist to some degree. Doing research yourself has become anathema, a waste of your valuable time, which ought to be spent polishing the funding proposal written by your postdoc. I find endeavours like retractionwatch a bit laughable. They focus on one symptom of the disease, ignoring the root cause, and manage to catch a few small fry Indians and Chinese who are playing the game devised by people operating in a different stratosphere, occasionally catching out some big names Moreover, they engage in the same sort of censorship of views that don’t fit within the consensus. At heart, they are just another parasitic organisation set up to get whatever riches they can extract can from modern day ‘science’ Vert astute observations Abbas. 🙂 When did university media departments start acting as the critical influence on research projects, results and publication? It seems to me that media releases are orchestrated even before the print on abstracts is dry these days. I don’t think that happens to be honest. They are reactive, any good news will be exploited for maximum publicity, but they play no part in the publication process. A lot of it is self promotion, driven by the academics themselves, especially on social media. Horribly narcissistic Self promotion and marketing yourself can be key to fast promotion. This is the modern way. You don’t say as a young academic I want to solve X and Y outstanding problems in my area. You pick a fashionable topic, put some spin on it to make it sound novel then aggressively market yourself internally and externally as some world leader in this thing This transparently shameless tactic can get you known by senior management – they just love this kind of thing. Combine this with good funding success and you’re on your way to fast promotion before you’ve even learned to tie your shoelaces as far as the actual research is concerned. These days it’s not good enough to be good at research and well respected in your field. It’s not easy for senior management to see that. You need a ‘vision’. Visions are things I have in my sleep, or if I were to hallucinate on acid. Real research is not needed when you have a vision. The idea goes like this. First pick the journals in which you want to publish. Then pick suitable topics and techniques. Then find some idea and keep polishing it until your turd looks like gold, and you make sure to keep repeating that it’s gold, a new kind of special gold never before discovered, more golden and shiny than conventional gold. Submit. Get all your PhDs doing this. Let them learn from each other In the old days we picked the challenges we wanted to work on, rather than the journals we wanted to publish in. People tended to publish in more specialised journals. You couldn’t bs, couldn’t bamboozle. The reviewers were experts and you couldn’t fool them all. Yes, people made claims to big up their research, but this was done in a measured way. Nobody was claiming to have revolutionised anything, unless they really did “Starting with experiments in 1859, John Tyndall was the first to produce evidence that what he called greenhouse gases are critical for life on Earth.” I’m willing to bet you can’t quote Tyndall referring to “greenhouse gases” – because he didn’t. Tyndall pointed out that without an atmosphere, plant life (and hence human life) would not be able to survive the low nighttime temperatures which would occur. Conversely, daytime maximum surface temperatures would exceed the boiling point of water. Just like the Moon! Tyndall was never silly enough to claim that increasing the amount of CO2 in air would increase the temperature. I suggest anyone who thinks I am wrong, to read “Heat – a mode of motion”, which Tyndall continuously revised after each addition, as his knowledge increased. I continue to be surprised at some of the ideas attributed to John Tyndall which are contradicted by what he wrote. But hey, others know what Tyndall thought, better than his thoughts expressed in his written work. I only know what he wrote. That’s enough for me. I’ve asked this before but I think it warrants repeating. Am I missing something with regard to the use of hydrogen as a fuel/ As I understand it, the by-product of burning hydrogen is water vapour, which apparently is a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. if that’s the case (and you believe that greenhouse gasses are responsible for global warming), then what is the rationale for burning hydrogen in the first place? Alan, you’re right of course: But the UN agenda is to control the energy so to direct societies toward “progressive” ends. So it’s all about accounting for reductions in CO2 and CH4. It’s worse. Steam reformation I believe is still the only way to produce hydrogen at scale. 27% CO2 or something. The puny bits of so called green hydrogen, eg from concentrated solar, are probably not worth the effort when taking into account the whole process involved in production and transportation. Do not try to make sense of it, this would be a mistake. For goodness sake we now even have a war on nitrogen The primary source of atmospheric water vapor is evaporation from surface water which covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface. Any added contribution from human activity is trivial. Since water vapor continually condenses and evaporates at rates controlled by temperature and pressure to try and maintain a local quasi-equilibrium, the effect of any added water vapor on atmospheric concentration is not predictable. As explained by AMO physicists William van Wijngaarden and William Happer, a 1% decrease in cloudiness can cause a warming equal to that of a doubling in CO2. You don’t say? Scientists discover unexpected decline in global ocean evaporation amid rising sea temperatures While the decreasing trend in ocean evaporation may seem counterintuitive in the context of global warming, it highlights the complexity of Earth’s climate system and the intricate feedback mechanisms that govern the planet’s hydrological processes. It sure does sound counterintuitive with the global boiling narrative but it depends on the Fruitloops giving the feedback and blowing wind up my ass that they’ve got a handle on all that settled science.

Title: Nvidia earnings are coming. Here's what to expect after the DeepSeek shock

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) stock advanced by more than 3% ahead of the AI chip giant’s scheduled release of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the close today. The shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO+0.12%) and Micron (MU+1.00%) also gained. The company is expected to report revenue of $38.1 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.33%). Net income is estimated to be $19.6 billion, or 85 cents a share, for the period ended in January. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, during its last report. FactSet analysts are expecting Nvidia to set fiscal first-quarter guidance at $42 billion. After Chinese AI startup DeepSeek spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. In December, the Hangzhou-based AI startup released DeepSeek-V3, a model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips. Earlier this month, however, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM+1.32%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. So Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.” Nvidia’s stock experienced an extended rally last week and has recovered about 90% of the value lost during the sell-off. In a note on Friday, Jefferies (JEF+1.22%) analysts noted Nvidia’s stock rally but said it “has been relatively range bound” since November due to fears from the broader market over “a slower ramp in Blackwell shipments.” Despite concerns over supply chain issues for Blackwell, Jefferies analysts said they “believe” Nvidia will deliver a beat and a raise, although “the magnitude is likely to be smaller than the typical $2-3B range.” “We continue to like NVDA during product ramps,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that it expects “the beats to reaccelerate” in the second half of the year as Blackwell continues to expand.

Meta said that the increase aims to bring executive compensation in line with other major technology firms. It’s worth pointing out that Meta announced an increase in executive bonuses soon after it laid off nearly 3,600 employees, which is around five percent of its total workforce. Furthermore, the company has also decided to reduce its annual distribution of stock options for thousands of its regular employees. Under the new plan, Meta executives will earn a yearly bonus of 200 percent of their base salary in 2025, which is a massive jump from 75 percent last year. A committee for Meta’s board of directors approved the change in bonuses on February 13th, on the grounds that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of target total compensation of executives holding similar positions” at rival companies. The social media giant has increased these bonuses while it is in the process of laying off five percent of its global workforce. This is despite the fact that Meta’s shares were nearly 50 percent higher over the past year, with a current stock price of nearly around $687 per share. Furthermore, the company recently announced that its fourth-quarter revenue increased 21 percent year-on-year to more than $48 billion. It’s worth mentioning that Meta has cut more than 20,000 jobs in the past few years. While Meta executives will enjoy their fat bonuses this year, the company’s regular employees will suffer. The company has slashed its annual distribution of stock options by roughly around 10 percent for its regular employees, reports The Financial Times. The exact reduction in the stock options could differ depending on where the employees are located and what their roles are in the organization. That said, the new bonus and stock plans will take effect from the 2025 performance cycle. As per a filing, the new bonus plan doesn’t apply to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, he doesn’t have to worry about his bottom line as he’s worth nearly $250 billion. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Alibaba is going all in on trying to beat the US at developing AI that can reason like a human being
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-share-price-china-ecommerce-ai-agi-tech-markets-deepseek-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-24T07:13:27Z
Full Content:
Hot stock Alibaba has set its sights beyond AI to focus on artificial general intelligence, or AGI. "We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence," said Eddie Wu, Alibaba's CEO, on Thursday. He called the pursuit of AGI the company's "first and foremost goal." AGI is AI technology that mimics human intelligence to the point that it can achieve complex cognitive tasks involving logic and reasoning. US-based companies working toward AGI include OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Masayoshi Son, the CEO of major AI investor SoftBank, said earlier this month that he expects AGI to arrive "much earlier" than his late-2024 forecast of two to three years. Wu's statement came after Alibaba released blockbuster results on Thursday. For the quarter ending in December, Alibaba posted an 8% rise in revenue to 280.2 billion yuan, or $38.6 billion. Profit rose to 48.9 billion yuan, beating analysts' expectations. "The pursuit of AGI can contribute immense business value," said Wu, citing studies indicating that AGI — when achieved — could replace or achieve 80% of human capabilities. He said about 50% of global GDP comes from wages for blue- and white-collar work. "If AGI can be achieved, then that could have a tremendous impact in terms of the restructuring industry around the world. It could have a significant influence on or even replace 50% of global GDP," he said. On Monday, Alibaba announced that it's planning to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. The company is in a crowded global race for AI supremacy as US tech giants ramp up their AI spending. According to recent earnings reports, the combined capital expenditures of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025. Amazon is leading the charge, with over $100 billion earmarked for capital expenditures this year. The vast majority will go toward expanding Amazon Web Services and scaling AI infrastructure, the company said. However, the dramatic rise of DeepSeek, which released a new cost-competitive AI model last month, has thrown Chinese tech companies into the spotlight and caused investors to question whether massive Big Tech AI investments are justified. US-listed Alibaba shares are up 70% this year to date, thanks to the boost from DeepSeek and after Alibaba announced that it was working with Apple to incorporate its AI into iPhones in China. The upswing marks a major turnaround after Beijing's yearslong Big Tech regulatory crackdown, when cofounder Jack Ma's tech empire came under intense scrutiny. Last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with the country's top tech leaders — including Ma — in a sign that the country's private sector is now back in favor again. The market is viewing the meeting as a possible end of the crackdown. The Chinese government is seemingly working to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns, and a real estate crisis, wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note last week following the event. On Monday, Hong Kong-listed Alibaba shares were 2.5% lower by midday after recent gains and as Asian stocks were broadly pressured by sharp losses in the US markets on Friday. Jump to

Gold prices eased on Friday as investors booked profits from the previous session’s record high, but were set for an eighth straight weekly gain, driven by strong safe-haven demand amid concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff plans. Prices have shattered two record highs last week to trade above $2,950, as uncertainties surrounding global economic growth and political instability have underscored investor appetite for bullion. Trump’s fresh bout of tariff plans announced earlier this week includes duties on lumber and forest products, on top of previously announced plans to impose duties on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. This is after the imposition of an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium. Despite all this we have witnessed a sharp fall in Dollar index hovering around 106 supporting prices on lower end. Focus this week will be on US GDP, Inflation, consumer confidence and durables goods orders data.

Recommendation: Buy; : TP: Rs. 4,300 ; Upside: 18% About Monarch Networth Capital Ltd. (MNCL) Since 2019, Monarch Networth has embarked on an extraordinary journey of transformation. The company has evolved from a traditional offline retail broking firm into a vibrant, fully integrated financial services powerhouse. Their strategic expansion into new realms such as Investment Banking, Alternative Investment Funds (AUM now at Rs 1000 cr.), Institutional Research, Debt Capital Markets, and Wealth Management has been nothing short of remarkable. The firm is present in 100+ cities with 55+ branches across the country and also has a sub-broker network of 900+. This year MNCL also announced a fundraise of 300 crore and issued a 1:1 bonus. The company profit soared from 2 crores in 2020 to 123 crores in 2024 with a profit of 40 crore alone in Q1 FY2025. “The market experienced tumultuous sessions, with initial attempts to rally ultimately faltering. The Trump administration’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs hit export-oriented industries hard, particularly the pharmaceutical sector, which saw significant underperformance. The auto sector also struggled, facing increased competition due to the opening up to foreign players. Adding to the market’s woes, the hawkish stance from the FOMC minutes cast a shadow over the likelihood of further rate cuts, complicating the economic outlook. However, the metal indices found some relief on Chinese steps to revive private investments. India is currently lagging behind its Asian peers, as FII outflows remain high, with the “sell India, buy China” strategy continuing to yield returns for the time being. Investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming pivotal indicators, such as the US Core PCE Price Index and India’s GDP growth rate. The market’s mood remains cautious, with pessimistic sentiments likely to linger until there is a marked improvement in corporate earnings and a conducive environment with easy global liquidity and stabilised currency.” Citi on Indigo: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 5200/Sh versus Rs 5100/Sh (Positive) Citi on Federal Bank: Maintain Buy on Bank, target price at Rs 242/Sh (Positive) Jefferies on M&M: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 4075/Sh (Positive) MS on Cyient: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 1750/Sh (Positive) Nomura on Auto: EV policy to accelerate adoption, Tesla’s entry to benefit suppliers like Sona Comstar, Sansera and Motherson Sumi (Positive) CLSA on IT sector: Demand drivers improving; GenAI to be revenue driver going forward.

Throughout the week, the benchmark index struggled to break free from a narrow range, reflecting a cautious sentiment. The lingering pressure from developments in the previous week significantly influenced market performance, resulting in a persistent stagnation as the index remained anchored near the lower boundary of the falling wedge pattern. As the week ended, the overall lack of enthusiasm culminated in a negative outcome, with the index sliding by 0.58 percent to settle a tad below the 22800 zone. The benchmark index has been under pressure over the past 13 trading sessions, with the exception of a brief respite at the beginning of the week. Unfortunately, that single day of positive movement did not lead to any lasting improvements or beneficial effects on the overall market trend. Since NIFTY has been hovering around the lower band of 22900 - 22700 for the last few days and has rejected all attempts to convincingly cross the 23000 mark, the key support of 22700 seems in jeopardy. As a result, we would see it entering a crucial support zone of 22700 - 22400, where the actual litmus test lies for our markets. This scenario would likely heighten volatility and amplify concerns among investors; but we would advise traders to not get carried away and should avoid staying aggressive short in the market. Let the market decide its next course of action during the monthly expiry week. The first obstacle is located at 23000-23150, corresponding to the 20-DEMA, followed closely by 23300-23350, which marks the upper band of the wedge pattern. It is only through a decisive breach of these resistances that some relief and upward movement may be restored for market participants, potentially providing a much-needed boost to investor confidence. In light of the shortened monthly expiry week and the prevailing global uncertainties, we can expect an uptick in market volatility. Given the current landscape, it is prudent for traders to refrain from making overly aggressive bets and to adopt a more cautious approach, maintaining lighter positions on both the bullish and bearish sides. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerabilities within the market highlight the critical importance of vigilance. Traders should proactively consider various risk management strategies to navigate the evolving conditions effectively, ensuring they are prepared for potential market shifts. “FII selling continues unabated in the Indian stock market. After selling stocks for Rs 81903 crores through the exchanges in January, FIIs followed it up by selling stocks for Rs 30588 crores in February through 21st. This takes the total selling in 2025, so far, to Rs 112492 crores (NSDL). This massive selling has resulted in the Nifty yielding negative returns of 4% YTD. After Trump’s victory in US presidential elections, the US market has been attracting huge capital inflows from the rest of the world. But recently, China has emerged as a major destination of portfolio flows. The Chinese president’s new initiatives with their leading businessmen have kindled hopes of a growth recovery in China. The Chinese stock market responded positively to this. The Hang Seng index (FIIs buy Chinese stocks through the Hong Kong stock market) shot up by 18.7% in a month in sharp contrast to the 1.55 % decline in the Nifty. Since Chinese stocks continue to be cheap, this ‘Sell India, Buy China’ trade may continue. But this trade has happened in the past and experience is that it will fizzle out soon since there are structural problems constraining Chinese economic revival. Revival of FII investment in India will happen when economic growth and corporate earnings revive. Indications of that are likely to happen in two to three months.” Bears will continue to tighten their grip on the Indian markets amid heavy FII selling on Monday. Gift Nifty at 22,690 indicates a gap-down opening of about 300 points. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, said: foreign investor sentiment also remained weak, with approximately $25 billion in FII outflows since the market peak in late September, driven by concerns over high valuations and a slowing economy. India’s GDP growth is projected to decelerate to a four-year low of 6.4 per cent in this fiscal year, raising apprehensions about corporate profitability and economic stability. Institutional activity reflected net FII outflows of ₹7,793 crore in the cash segment, while DII inflows stood at ₹16,582 crore, offering some support to the market.

Gold prices eased on Friday as investors booked profits from the previous session’s record high, but were set for an eighth straight weekly gain, driven by strong safe-haven demand amid concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff plans. Prices have shattered two record highs last week to trade above $2,950, as uncertainties surrounding global economic growth and political instability have underscored investor appetite for bullion. Trump’s fresh bout of tariff plans announced earlier this week includes duties on lumber and forest products, on top of previously announced plans to impose duties on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. This is after the imposition of an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium. Despite all this we have witnessed a sharp fall in Dollar index hovering around 106 supporting prices on lower end. Focus this week will be on US GDP, Inflation, consumer confidence and durables goods orders data.

Recommendation: Buy; : TP: Rs. 4,300 ; Upside: 18% About Monarch Networth Capital Ltd. (MNCL) Since 2019, Monarch Networth has embarked on an extraordinary journey of transformation. The company has evolved from a traditional offline retail broking firm into a vibrant, fully integrated financial services powerhouse. Their strategic expansion into new realms such as Investment Banking, Alternative Investment Funds (AUM now at Rs 1000 cr.), Institutional Research, Debt Capital Markets, and Wealth Management has been nothing short of remarkable. The firm is present in 100+ cities with 55+ branches across the country and also has a sub-broker network of 900+. This year MNCL also announced a fundraise of 300 crore and issued a 1:1 bonus. The company profit soared from 2 crores in 2020 to 123 crores in 2024 with a profit of 40 crore alone in Q1 FY2025. “The market experienced tumultuous sessions, with initial attempts to rally ultimately faltering. The Trump administration’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs hit export-oriented industries hard, particularly the pharmaceutical sector, which saw significant underperformance. The auto sector also struggled, facing increased competition due to the opening up to foreign players. Adding to the market’s woes, the hawkish stance from the FOMC minutes cast a shadow over the likelihood of further rate cuts, complicating the economic outlook. However, the metal indices found some relief on Chinese steps to revive private investments. India is currently lagging behind its Asian peers, as FII outflows remain high, with the “sell India, buy China” strategy continuing to yield returns for the time being. Investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming pivotal indicators, such as the US Core PCE Price Index and India’s GDP growth rate. The market’s mood remains cautious, with pessimistic sentiments likely to linger until there is a marked improvement in corporate earnings and a conducive environment with easy global liquidity and stabilised currency.” Citi on Indigo: Maintain Buy on Company, raise target price at Rs 5200/Sh versus Rs 5100/Sh (Positive) Citi on Federal Bank: Maintain Buy on Bank, target price at Rs 242/Sh (Positive) Jefferies on M&M: Maintain Buy on Company, target price at Rs 4075/Sh (Positive) MS on Cyient: Maintain Overweight on Company, target price at Rs 1750/Sh (Positive) Nomura on Auto: EV policy to accelerate adoption, Tesla’s entry to benefit suppliers like Sona Comstar, Sansera and Motherson Sumi (Positive) CLSA on IT sector: Demand drivers improving; GenAI to be revenue driver going forward.

Throughout the week, the benchmark index struggled to break free from a narrow range, reflecting a cautious sentiment. The lingering pressure from developments in the previous week significantly influenced market performance, resulting in a persistent stagnation as the index remained anchored near the lower boundary of the falling wedge pattern. As the week ended, the overall lack of enthusiasm culminated in a negative outcome, with the index sliding by 0.58 percent to settle a tad below the 22800 zone. The benchmark index has been under pressure over the past 13 trading sessions, with the exception of a brief respite at the beginning of the week. Unfortunately, that single day of positive movement did not lead to any lasting improvements or beneficial effects on the overall market trend. Since NIFTY has been hovering around the lower band of 22900 - 22700 for the last few days and has rejected all attempts to convincingly cross the 23000 mark, the key support of 22700 seems in jeopardy. As a result, we would see it entering a crucial support zone of 22700 - 22400, where the actual litmus test lies for our markets. This scenario would likely heighten volatility and amplify concerns among investors; but we would advise traders to not get carried away and should avoid staying aggressive short in the market. Let the market decide its next course of action during the monthly expiry week. The first obstacle is located at 23000-23150, corresponding to the 20-DEMA, followed closely by 23300-23350, which marks the upper band of the wedge pattern. It is only through a decisive breach of these resistances that some relief and upward movement may be restored for market participants, potentially providing a much-needed boost to investor confidence. In light of the shortened monthly expiry week and the prevailing global uncertainties, we can expect an uptick in market volatility. Given the current landscape, it is prudent for traders to refrain from making overly aggressive bets and to adopt a more cautious approach, maintaining lighter positions on both the bullish and bearish sides. Furthermore, the inherent vulnerabilities within the market highlight the critical importance of vigilance. Traders should proactively consider various risk management strategies to navigate the evolving conditions effectively, ensuring they are prepared for potential market shifts. “FII selling continues unabated in the Indian stock market. After selling stocks for Rs 81903 crores through the exchanges in January, FIIs followed it up by selling stocks for Rs 30588 crores in February through 21st. This takes the total selling in 2025, so far, to Rs 112492 crores (NSDL). This massive selling has resulted in the Nifty yielding negative returns of 4% YTD. After Trump’s victory in US presidential elections, the US market has been attracting huge capital inflows from the rest of the world. But recently, China has emerged as a major destination of portfolio flows. The Chinese president’s new initiatives with their leading businessmen have kindled hopes of a growth recovery in China. The Chinese stock market responded positively to this. The Hang Seng index (FIIs buy Chinese stocks through the Hong Kong stock market) shot up by 18.7% in a month in sharp contrast to the 1.55 % decline in the Nifty. Since Chinese stocks continue to be cheap, this ‘Sell India, Buy China’ trade may continue. But this trade has happened in the past and experience is that it will fizzle out soon since there are structural problems constraining Chinese economic revival. Revival of FII investment in India will happen when economic growth and corporate earnings revive. Indications of that are likely to happen in two to three months.” Bears will continue to tighten their grip on the Indian markets amid heavy FII selling on Monday. Gift Nifty at 22,690 indicates a gap-down opening of about 300 points. Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group, said: foreign investor sentiment also remained weak, with approximately $25 billion in FII outflows since the market peak in late September, driven by concerns over high valuations and a slowing economy. India’s GDP growth is projected to decelerate to a four-year low of 6.4 per cent in this fiscal year, raising apprehensions about corporate profitability and economic stability. Institutional activity reflected net FII outflows of ₹7,793 crore in the cash segment, while DII inflows stood at ₹16,582 crore, offering some support to the market.
