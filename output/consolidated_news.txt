Title: Tech Workers Are in Deep, Deep Trouble

By Joe Wilkins Published Nov 8, 2025 12:45 PM EST For years, any American kid eying a stable, future-proof job was told to “learn to code.” Now in 2025, anyone who followed that advice faces a painful reckoning: a decade of booming computer science enrollments has created a massive pile-up of graduates entering an abysmal job market. A new report by the analyst firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks layoffs across various industries, found that the US tech industry had the highest number of layoffs in October of any sector, with a whopping 33,281 tech workers out of the job. That’s an awfully high number for one month, and it looks even worse in context — just a month earlier, the number of tech industry layoffs was only 5,639. Tech companies are planning to lay off 141,159 jobs this year so far, per the report, up from 120,470 over the same period in 2024. And it likely may not look much better in the near future, either. “It’s possible with rate cuts and a strong showing in November, companies may make a late-season push for employees,” the report reads, “but at this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025.” The analysis was spotted by SF Gate, which reported that tech company job cuts in the US are at their highest levels since 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a short-lived recession. For the month of October, however, the analyst report notes that total layoffs haven’t been this high since 2003 — in other words, not even the global financial crisis was this much of a bloodbath. While it’s easy to blame AI for the tech industry layoffs, CG&C highlights some other factors contributing to the dismal labor news. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” the firm wrote. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes.” Across all industries, “those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,” the report commentary read. The depressing economic news comes as tech companies look to be some of the first adopters of their own AI systems, a proving ground of sorts for the software they hope will bring about a new stage of human civilization. Last week, Amazon cut some 14,000 jobs within its corporate offices, with thousands more likely on the way. Over the summer, when Microsoft sacked 9,000 employees, its CEO suggested freshly-unemployed workers turn to AI chatbots to help “reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.” Meanwhile, there’s plenty of reason to doubt that AI is actually capable of replacing thousands of employees — a narrative tech executives have a material interest in maintaining. While some companies like Amazon were surely over-bloated following pandemic hiring sprees, AI is mostly failing when used to improve revenue streams, the reason companies execute these layoffs in the first place. The question, then, is how much deeper the layoffs are going to go — something only some of the most powerful corporate executives can answer.

Title: T Rowe Price’s Calculated Bet: Why the Quintessential “Singles Hitter” Is Swinging for Crypto
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/11/t-rowe-prices-calculated-bet-why-the-quintessential-singles-hitter-is-swinging-for-crypto/

In the buttoned-down world of institutional asset management, T Rowe Price has long been the firm that makes boring look brilliant. While competitors chased hot trends and flashy returns, the Baltimore-based firm built its reputation as the quintessential “singles hitter,” compounding modest, steady gains into industry-leading long-term performance through disciplined, research-driven processes. Which makes the 87-year-old firm’s October 2025 filing for the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF seem, at first glance, utterly out of character. Cryptocurrencies? The asset class synonymous with wild volatility, 70%+ drawdowns, and a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to a wall? For a firm that has weathered every market cycle since 1937 by staying boringly sensible? Yet for those who understand T Rowe Price’s culture, the move is precisely in character. Because when Price’s research leads somewhere, the firm follows, even when it means moving ahead of the crowd into uncomfortable territory. Price is decidedly not an early mover. The filing comes nearly two years after the SEC’s watershed January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which triggered what one analysis called “a 400% acceleration in institutional investment flows” and have since attracted over $150 billion in assets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK dominated that first wave, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) becoming the third-largest ETF by inflows in 2024—trailing only broad S&P 500 index funds and accumulating over $50 billion in assets in less than a year. By late 2025, the landscape will have exploded into what Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas describes as an impending reality where there will be “more crypto ETF filings than stocks.” Over 92 cryptocurrency ETF applications now await SEC review, covering everything from single-asset Solana and XRP funds to multi-crypto index products, staking-enabled ETFs, and even proposals for memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. (sigh) Price’s filing, which Balchunas called a “semi-shock” from a “top 5 active manager,” sits frozen with dozens of others during a federal government shutdown that has left the SEC with skeleton staffing and no clear timeline for approvals. Yet Price’s approach differs fundamentally from the herd. While most applications target passive index tracking or single-coin exposure, Price is proposing an actively managed multi-asset fund (holding 5-15 cryptocurrencies) that applies its core competency – fundamental research, valuation analysis, and active portfolio management – to the crypto space. This isn’t about being first to market. It’s about being right. “If you don’t start out as a crypto skeptic, there’s something wrong with you,” writes Blue Macellari, T Rowe Price’s head of digital assets, in one of three recent research papers on cryptocurrencies the firm shared with us. It’s a revealing admission that captures Price’s approach: start with skepticism, follow the data, and let the conclusions emerge. Price hired Macellari, a former crypto hedge fund executive, in 2022, not to chase trends but to build genuine expertise. The firm has spent years “monitoring developments in the digital assets space closely and developing the ability to trade digital assets,” according to company statements. Those conclusions, detailed in research by Justin Thomson (Head of the T Rowe Price Investment Institute) and Stefan Hubrich (Head of Global Multi-Asset Research), suggest that digital assets have reached an inflection point. They’re not just speculative toys anymore; they’re potentially evolving into a legitimate asset class. The key insight: while Bitcoin has endured four drawdowns exceeding 70%, each near-death experience has been followed by stronger recoveries. Despite extreme volatility (daily price swings of 5-10% remain common), the asset class refuses to disappear. More importantly, Price’s analysts have identified a potential path from “risk-on” to “risk-off” status for digital assets. If volatility dampens and cryptocurrencies decorrelate from other risk assets like high-growth equities, they could transition from speculative investments to mainstream portfolio components. For a firm built on fundamental analysis, cryptocurrencies posed a unique problem: how do you value an asset with no cash flows, no earnings, and no balance sheet? T Rowe Price analyst David Kroger addressed this by adapting traditional discounted cash flow frameworks, using staking rewards as a substitute for cash flow in the valuation process. The methodology acknowledges that cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks with different consensus mechanisms; Bitcoin uses energy-intensive “proof of work” mining, while Ethereum employs “proof of stake” validation. (No, I have no clue what those phrases mean.) The critical distinction: unlike gold (another non-cash-generating asset), Bitcoin is actually used for real-world transactions. With Bitcoin’s programmatically fixed supply of 21 million tokens, growth in transaction volume measured in USD necessitates a rising price for Bitcoin. This creates a potential return framework if Bitcoin transaction volumes grow alongside the broader economy. Over the 12 months ended August 2024, more than $1.3 billion in fees were expended on the Bitcoin network to support a total transaction volume of $2.4 trillion, demonstrating real economic utility. The crypto ETF filing comes at a pivotal moment for T Rowe Price. Like many active managers, the firm has faced persistent outflows as investors gravitate toward lower-cost passive strategies. The firm manages $1.77 trillion in assets but has been “seeking to diversify into new areas,” according to industry analysts. In response, Price has launched 24 ETFs in recent years—a dramatic expansion for a firm historically focused on mutual funds. Last month, it announced a partnership with Goldman Sachs to develop new private market products for retail investors. The Active Crypto ETF represents both a continuation of this ETF strategy and something more: evidence that Price’s research apparatus sees genuine opportunity in digital assets, not just a need to check a product box. As VettaFi’s Todd Rosenbluth noted, “It’s exciting to see them expand their ETF lineup beyond stock and bond exposure.” Price’s researchers acknowledge sympathy for the “digital gold” thesis: the view that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against financial collapse, similar to physical gold but with advantages like algorithmic scarcity rather than mere physical limits. But they’ve moved beyond that framework. Understanding value in crypto means “applying alternative notions of utility; it is a parallel world to ‘Trad-Fi,’ with a different lexicon,” Thomson writes. That lexicon includes concepts like decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and token burning, all of which create potential economic value flows. The comparison to gold is instructive but incomplete. Both Bitcoin and gold have scarcity value and bear a cost of carry since neither generates income. But Bitcoin’s algorithmic supply limit (the “halving” that occurs every four years until 2140, when the maximum 21 million tokens will exist) distinguishes it from paper currencies printed without theoretical limits. Thomson opens his research with a cautionary tale about a 1999 stock called Fyffes that jumped 40% in one day merely by announcing a virtual fruit market, then contrasts it with a 2024 crypto entrepreneur paying $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall before eating it in front of journalists. Both stories feature “a whiff of alchemy and transience—that wealth can be created and destroyed from fumes,” Thomson writes. Yet his conclusion is not to dismiss crypto but to separate “the ephemeral from the permanent, the froth from the substance, Ponzi from probity.” Price’s framework suggests that for digital assets to merit inclusion in diversified portfolios, they need an expectation of positive future returns, specifically, excess returns above cash that reward investors for accepting risk. Traditional assets like stocks (with equity risk premiums) and bonds (with duration premiums) have decades of data supporting this expectation. Digital assets have reached what Price calls the “gold stage.” They have economic value greater than zero. The next step is establishing a durable long-term return thesis beyond merely betting on continued adoption or financial collapse. The fact that Price is willing to file for a crypto ETF suggests its research team believes that thesis is taking shape. Hubrich’s analysis is particularly telling: “To formulate a long-term return thesis for digital assets (Das), investors will need to determine whether passive holders should expect to participate in the value added by the blockchain. The answer is likely to depend on the DA, so this analysis will need to be conducted on a case-by-case basis.” This is precisely the type of granular, security-by-security analysis that Price has applied to stocks and bonds for decades. Dominic Rizzo, who manages some of T Rowe Price’s ETFs, signaled the firm’s direction at an ETF conference earlier in 2025, noting that “now is a good time to consider bitcoin exposure” and comparing cryptocurrency pricing to commodities, saying it “closely tracks the cost of mining it.” These weren’t off-the-cuff remarks but deliberate signals from a firm that doesn’t speculate publicly. When the government shutdown ends and the SEC resumes processing applications, Price won’t be first out of the gate. But if the firm’s research proves prescient, the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF could establish the standard for how thoughtful, non-speculative institutional investors approach digital assets by applying rigorous fundamental analysis to select among cryptocurrencies based on network usage, staking rewards, adoption trends, and value creation. For a firm that has navigated the Great Depression, multiple wars, the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, and countless market cycles, launching a crypto ETF is not a panic move or a desperate grab for assets. It’s a calculated decision backed by years of research and a belief that digital assets are evolving into something durable. As software engineer Jameson Lopp observes in Thomson’s research: “First step to understanding crypto: admitting you don’t understand crypto. Final step: realizing that ‘understanding’ is a moving target.” For T Rowe Price, that journey from skepticism to cautious embrace reflects the same discipline that has defined the firm for nearly nine decades. The research led somewhere uncomfortable, somewhere new, somewhere volatile—and Price followed. Whether that decision proves prescient or premature won’t be known for years. But it demonstrates that even the most conservative firms must evolve when the research is clear. Sometimes the most characteristic move is the one that looks uncharacteristic.

Title: Consumer sentiment is sinking across the board — except for Americans with the most stocks

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The ongoing government shutdown has helped push confidence to near-record lows, but one segment of the population is actually feeling more optimistic. The initial reading for the University of Michigan’s sentiment index fell to 50.3 in November from 53.6 last month, almost matching the all-time low of 50 from June 2022, when the annual rate of inflation hit its post-pandemic high. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a statement Friday. The decline was widespread and was seen across different age groups, income brackets, and political affiliations, she added. But not everyone followed that trend. “One key exception: consumers with the largest tercile of stock holdings posted a notable 11% increase in sentiment, supported by continued strength in stock markets,” Hsu said. The survey closed before Tuesday’s elections, which revealed continued voter discontent about affordability as food and energy prices creep higher. The timing is also notable given that it didn’t capture the most recent stock market selloff that sent the Nasdaq to its worst weekly loss since April’s trade war chaos. That came as investors grew more concerned about the AI boom looking like a bubble that could pop soon. Until this past week, the stock market was on a hot streak, notching fresh record high after record high, with the S&P 500 even closing in on the 7,000 milestone. The market’s impact on consumer sentiment comes as stock ownership has broadened over past five years into more income and age groups. A separate University of Michigan report from last month said the increase in market participation has been especially large among lower-income consumers, while participation rates of younger and older consumers have caught up with middle-aged consumers. In fact, a survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are now retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. Stock ownership has highlighted a divergence in consumer sentiment in recent months: investors are turning more upbeat while non-investors have turned more pessimistic, according to University of Michigan data from October. And participants with the top 20% of stock holdings are especially optimistic. The spilt even mirrors the K-shaped economy that has emerged as higher-income Americans continue to spend and prop up overall consumption, while others have pulled back. Meanwhile, the so-called wealth effect of higher asset prices on consumer spending has become more potent in the last 15 years, making it harder to separate the stock market from the economy. Today, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010, according to Oxford Economics. The University of Michigan pointed out in October that sentiment among stock market participants had been on the rise since May—after tumbling in April when President Donald Trump shocked global markets with his “Liberation Day” tariffs. By contrast, sentiment for non-stockholders continued to decline and had already hit post-pandemic lows. “These patterns are consistent with the fact that strong asset values support consumer sentimentonly for those who own those assets,” the report said. “Meanwhile, given that wealthier, higher-income consumers generate a disproportionate share of aggregate spending, the recent uptick in sentiment among these households may may help buoy consumption spending even amid views of the economy that are relatively subdued from a historical perspective.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Refining My Conservative Retirement Target Portfolio

Using historical data on funds to make assumptions about future performance involves correctly interpreting the trends. Over the past six years, the U.S. has experienced an extraordinarily unusual period: During the next six years, we will probably experience another bear market and modest to moderate inflation. Interest rates are likely to continue falling in the short-term, but not as low as the decade following the financial crisis because of less Quantitative Easing and higher deficits and national debt. High valuations are a headwind to equity returns, and high interest rates are a tailwind for bond returns. In January 2020, before the start of the COVID bar market, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was an elevated 26 and is currently 31. I believe that the full COVID Cycle from January 2020 to December 2021 and 2025 are more representative of market conditions for the next six years than the period from January 2022 to December 2024. In this article, I explore how alternative investments and mixed asset funds with flexible strategies can be used to develop a conservative portfolio. To evaluate funds, I selected thirty-six funds in twenty-three different Lipper Categories that had good risk-adjusted performance during the full COVID cycle and 2025. I created an optimizer using Excel Solver to maximize the Martin Ratio for the full COVID cycle with constraints for portfolio concentration, minimum returns, drawdowns, yields, allocation to “junk bonds”, and consistency across the individual years and bear markets. Figure #1 shows the performance during the past four bear markets by allocation to stocks for all of the 461 mixed asset funds in the Lipper global dataset with at least six years of history. Note that the severity of the bear market has a larger impact on the portfolio performance than the of the stock to bond ratio. The two black dashed lines show a range of likely maximum downturns for the three bear markets, excluding the dotcom bear market, which was associated with a mild recession. The three maroon squares are the maximum drawdowns of the “Conservative” and “Moderate” portfolios that I created and the target portfolio that I described last month in Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control. The two portfolios created for this article had low to average drawdowns. Figure #1: Mixed Asset Fund Drawdowns During Four Bear Markets Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #1 shows the average annualized returns over the past six years for the mixed asset funds and the “Conservative”, “Moderate”, and original target portfolio. The two new portfolios outperformed both the mixed asset funds and the original target portfolio. Table #1: Mixed Asset Fund Returns for Past Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I am currently reading “A Crash Course on Crises: Macroeconomic Concepts for Run-Ups, Collapses, and Recoveries” by Princeton University economics professor Markus K. Brunnermeier and London School of Economics professor Ricardo Reis, which researches the interrelationship between financial markets and the economy during a crisis. They describe part of their audience to be “members of the informed public wanting to absorb some of the concepts that should be guiding both macroeconomic and financial policy.” The book contains some wonderful insights into investing behavior, such as “Why don’t other, more sophisticated investors, lean against the bubble, preventing it from arising in the first place?” They continue, “These investors try to forecast how long the bubble will persist, which is governed by the trading behavior of the other (sophisticated) investors.” I have no illusions that I can predict the behavior of other sophisticated investors. As described by Hyman Minsky, many crises are preceded by some type of innovation (such as artificial intelligence) followed by long periods of price increases, speculation, and leverage. These are followed by a period of instability and traders becoming risk-averse and de-leveraging. Stock market price-to-earnings ratios were around 18 before the 1929 stock market crash, peaked at 34 prior to the bursting of the dotcom bubble, hit 21 prior to the start of the financial crisis, and are now at an elevated 31. There are usually “triggering events” that set off chain reactions between asset markets and financial markets that determine the severity of corrections and whether a macro-financial crisis results. At the National Association for Business Economics, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, “When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn.” The stage is set for a correction, and there are plenty of potential “triggering events” such as a slowing economy, rising inflation, potential supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical risk. Figure #2 represents the investing environment for the past six years. Fiscal and monetary stimulus contained the economic fallout from the COVID bear market lasting from January 2020 through March of that year, but Personal Consumption Price inflation rose from a half percent following the COVID bear market to nearly seven percent by January 2022. Charles Boccadoro described The Great Normalization (TGN) in which interest rates normalized to higher rates, hurting bond performance. The TGN bear market lasted from January 2022 to September of that year. By December 2023, the price-to-earnings ratio had crossed the high valuation level of $25 per dollar of earnings. The debasement trade is partly the result of investors and global central banks buying gold and the increased acceptance of cryptocurrency. I believe that the dollar will weaken but not be replaced as the global reserve currency, and the debasement trade is overbought. Figure #2: The COVID and Great Normalization Full Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The full COVID Cycle was from January 2020 to December 2021 and includes the COVID bear market and inflation. I expect cycles of bear markets and inflation to be more frequent in the coming decade than in the decade following the financial crisis. Rates are high, so “The Great Normalization” of rising rates is unlikely to occur to such extremes for many years. Finally, valuations are currently high and more likely to fall than rise either over time or in a correction with a “triggering event”. I set up my Excel optimizer for both the Conservative and Moderate portfolios to maximize the Martin Ratio for the January 2020 to December 2021 period by changing allocations to 36 funds with constraints that I wanted to have drawdowns of less than nine percent for both the COVID and TGN bear markets. Maximum allocations were set for Alternative, Bond, Equity, and Mixed Asset fund types to ensure diversification. The Conservative portfolio has additional constraints of having yields at least 4% with less than 13% allocated to lower quality “junk bonds”. Figure #3 contains the inflation-adjusted results from Portfolio Visualizer assuming 4% annual withdrawals for the Conservative, Moderate, and Original Target Portfolio compared to the Fidelity Asset Manager 40% (FFANX), which is a good global mixed asset fund. The link is provided here. The Conservative and Moderate portfolios had similar returns through 2023, with the Moderate portfolio having higher volatility. Both beat inflation over the six years after adjusting for withdrawals. During the period of rising valuations and the debasement trade, the Moderate Portfolio has outperformed. Both outperformed the Original Target Portfolio from my last article because of a wider selection of funds under consideration, improvements in methodology, and an increase in the maximum allocation for a fund from 10% to 15%. All three outperformed the 40/60 baseline fund, which was negatively impacted during the rising rates period. Figure #3: Conservative and Moderate Portfolio Growth – Six Years Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #2 contains the resulting allocations with the funds sorted from the lowest Ulcer Ratio over the past six years to the highest. I own shares in FPFIX/FFIRX, PCBAX, PMAIX, PZRMX, and AVALX. It will take a couple of years to fill out the rest of the portfolio, depending upon cash flows, and I will lean towards the less risky funds next. Table #2: Portfolio Allocations Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 contains the portfolio metrics for the period May 2019 to September 2025 from Portfolio Visualizer. Annualized returns are after withdrawals, while Time-Weighted Rate of Return reflects investment performance. Table #3: Portfolio Performance Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #4 contains the metrics and ratings from MFO for the funds for the past six years. They are sorted from the lowest Ulcer Index, which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns from the lowest to the highest. MFO Risk is based on the Ulcer Index comparing all funds, while the Ulcer Rating is for funds within the same category peers. Martin Ratio is the risk-free return divided by the Ulcer Index. The MFO Rating is based on the Martin Ratio for funds within the same Lipper Category. The Batting Average Rating (BA) is based on the percentage of the months that a fund beat its peers. One takeaway is that some of the funds outperformed during down markets but lagged peers overall. Table #4: Fund Metrix – Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Optimization depends on having funds with low correlations to each other. Notice that some funds had their maximum drawdowns during the COVID (2020) bear market, and some had them during the Great Normalization (2022) bear market. Table #5 shows how the funds performed in each of the bear markets and the bull markets. The lower-risk funds provide some safety during downturns, while the riskier funds provide growth potential. Blue shaded cells indicate the best performers, and red are the worst performers. Table #5: Fund Performance During COVID and Great Normalization Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Columbia Thermostat bases its stock to bond allocation on valuations. During the financial crisis, the strategy was to invest in all stocks or bonds, and it did not perform well. It has improved its strategy to have a range of allocations depending on price levels and performed well during the COVID bear market. The Fact Sheet indicates that the fund is currently 70% invested in fixed income and 30% invested in equity. It contains the allocation to stocks by the S&P 500 level. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PBAIX, PCBAX) is an Alternative Global Macro fund that has performed well since the 2008 financial crisis, but during the financial crisis fell nearly 27% in 2008 and returned 26% in 2009. I own shares in PCBAX, but limit allocations to alternatives because they use derivatives, which can be less predictable during a crisis. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) is another good Alternative Global Macro fund that had a maximum drawdown of 7% during the financial crisis. I included it in the original target portfolio from last month. The Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) is based on the concepts developed by Harry Browne in the 1980s to provide steady, long-term growth with low volatility without trying to time the market. The fund managers describe Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) as, “Designed as a core portfolio holding, Permanent Portfolio seeks to preserve and increase the purchasing power value of each shareholder’s account over the long-term, regardless of current or future market conditions, through strategic investments in a broad array of different asset classes.” It invests fixed percentages of its net assets in dollar assets (35%), gold (20%), aggressive growth stocks (15%), real estate and natural resource stocks (15%), Swiss Franc assets (10%), and silver (5%). The PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) is described by the fund managers as “By investing in a blend of inflation-related asset classes, the fund seeks to help preserve and grow purchasing power, enhance portfolio diversification, and guard against market shocks across varying inflation environments.” It currently has a composition of Inflation Linked Bonds 68%), Commodities (22%), Currencies (15%), REITS (10%), and Precious Metals (10%). I own shares in PZRMX. Figure #4 contains some of the funds that did well during 2020 to 2022 with high inflation. These are mostly in the Flexible Portfolio Lipper Category plus DIVO in equity income, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX, maroon line) in the Alternative Global Macro category, and the PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX, red line) in the Flexible Portfolio Category. During the period in between the bear markets, the S&P 500 rose 89% while core bonds rose a paltry 2.5%. Figure #4: Fund Performance During Inflation (2020 – 2022) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset and St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. From 2012 through 2019, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) had very similar performance. From 2019 through 2021, PRPFX outperformed PZRMX and greatly outperformed starting in 2023. I prefer owning PRPFX and PZRMX to directly owning gold because it is much more volatile. Over the past year, I decreased my allocation to stock from 65% to 50% which is a small decrease in risk. Rebalancing during high market valuations and downturns is a modest way of “buying low and selling high”. I believe that risk risk-adjusted performance of bonds to be greater than equities for the next few years. Using the bucket approach to match risk assets with spending needs and using bond ladders does more to reduce portfolio risk than lowering the allocation to stocks. As a qualifier, I use financial advisors to manage the majority of my portfolio using a traditional, globally diversified 60/40 portfolio. I am developing this “Conservative Portfolio” strategy for a subset of the portfolio that I manage in addition to traditional bond funds and bond ladders to have liquidity available in any market condition, and with some growth potential.

Welcome to the casino! GraniteShares 3x Short AMD Daily ETP, a product marketed for European investors, recently pulled off the rare feat of going to zero. The fund, purely a speculator’s trading vehicle, was designed to rise by 3% for every 1% that AMD stock fell. Perfect opp for experienced sharks to dart in, tear off a chunk of carcass, and get out before anything bad can happen. Think of a holding time that might be measured in seconds, and you’re there. The fund imploded when AMD announced a deal with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs for OpenAI’s next-generation AI infrastructure. AMD’s stock surged up 37% before the market even opened. In consequence, the fund was structured to fall by more than 100% leading to an “index cancellation redemption event.” Alternatively, it is a good reminder that in a casino, the house always wins. Akre Focus Fund completed its reorganization into the Akre Focus ETF effective October 27th. The reorganization will result in no changes to its investment objectives or fundamental investment approach. The ETF is expected to deliver the strategy in a more cost-effective, tax-efficient, and flexible format for shareholders. ARK Bitcoin Yield ETF is in registration. Catherine D. Wood and William Scherer will oversee the daily operations of the ETF. Expenses have not been stated. BBH Select Series Large Cap and Mid Cap funds will be reorganized into related ETFs. Existing fund shareholders will be shareholders of the ETFs before the commencement of trading on November 17th. BBH touts the ability to trade intraday, portfolio transparency, and potentially lower expenses and tax bills as reasons for considering the ETFs. The reorganization will be a tax-free event. The case for the fund, beyond that, is open to question. Each fund has about half a billion in assets and, by Morningstar’s measure, offers low relative risk but below-average returns. As measured by the Sharpe ratio, the funds are not compelling; each is below its benchmark and category over the past three years, with managers who have been on board for about four (Large Cap) and two years (Mid Cap). Dimensional Funds Advisors has filed a registration statement for its first ETF share class of funds since Vanguard’s patent expired in 2023. The 13 incipient ETFs are: U.S. Large Company, U.S. Large Cap Equity, U.S. Small Cap Value, U.S. Targeted Value, U.S. Core Equity 1, U.S. Core Equity 2, U.S. Vector Equity, U.S. Small Cap, U.S. Micro Cap, U.S. High Relative Profitability, DFA Real Estate Securities, U.S. Large Cap Growth, U.S. Small Cap Growth ETF The SEC has stated that it is going to issue an order allowing the firm to have this type of structure. JP Morgan has completed its reorganization of its JP Morgan National Municipal Income Fund into the JP Morgan Municipal ETF effective October 27, 2025. Lazard Emerging Markets Core Equity Portfolio Fund was converted into the Lazard Emerging Markets Opportunities ETF on October 27, 2025. Pabrai Wagons ETF is in registration. Mohnish Pabrai will be the portfolio manager; expenses have not been stated. Our colleague, Devesh Shah, profiled the estimable Mr. Pabrai and the open-end fund version in “The Pabrai Fund Overview and Interview with Mohnish Pabrai” (10/2024). Top 20% among global small- to mid-caps in 2024, bottom 10% YTD in 2025, much smaller and cheaper stocks than its peers, fully invested. Thrivent Core Small Cap Value fund will be converted into an ETF, pending receipt of shareholder approval, on November 21, 2025. Vanguard launched the Vanguard Emerging Markets ex-China ETF (VEXC). The portfolio managers for VEXC will be Michael Perre, Jeffrey Miller, and John Kraynak, CFA. The ETF will launch with an expected expense ratio of 0.07%. The ETF will offer exposure to emerging markets equities while excluding securities classified by FTSE as being based in China. American Century Small Cap Value fund will reopen to new investors on December 9th. It has been closed since August 2021. Effective December 1, 2025, Clearbridge Small Cap Growth Fund will reopen to purchases (and incoming exchanges!) from new investors. Wasatch International Small Cap Value and Global Small Cap Value funds began to be offered to investors on October 1. Effective as of December 8, 2025, the AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund becomes the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, (ii) make changes to its principal investment strategies and principal risks, (iii) changes from “non‑diversified” to “diversified”, (iv) replaces the S&P 500 Growth Index, one of its benchmark indices, with the Russell 2000 Growth Index and (v) gets a new management team. Other than that, all quiet. Effective October 29, 2025, the CCM Global Equity ETF (CCMG) became the Sequoia Global Value ETF (SFGV). The fund launched in January 2024, modestly trails its peers and benchmark … and has drawn a billion in assets. Curious. The Frontier MFG Core Infrastructure Fund was renamed the MFG Core Infrastructure Fund on October 31, 2025. On or about December 15, 2025, the Gabelli Automation ETF will change to the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. Given that the fund has accumulated a tepid record and under $7 million AUM in nearly four years, I wouldn’t be rushing in. On April 21, 2025, Macquarie Group Limited, the parent company of Delaware Investments Funds Advisers, announced that it had entered into an agreement for Nomura Holding America Inc. to acquire Macquarie Asset Management’s US and European public investments business. The transaction closed on November 1, 2025. One consequence is that Macquarie funds will pick up the Nomura name. Should the Board approve these name changes, they would become effective as of May 1, 2026. On or around December 19, 2025, the Rayliant Quantamental Emerging Market ex-China Equity ETF will be succeeded by the Rayliant Wilshire NxtGen Emerging Markets Equity ETF. Among the … uhh, tweaks, accompanying the name change: “the Fund will transition from an actively-managed exchange-traded fund that invests primarily in equity securities of companies in emerging markets, excluding China, to a passively-managed ETF that seeks to track the performance of a machine learning-driven index that includes equity securities of companies in emerging markets, including China.” Quick heads up for shoppers: no need to buy Christmas presents for the Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, which will endure no more as of Christmas Eve, 2025. ATAC US Rotation ETF departed on October 24, 2025. That’s separate from the older, more successful ATAC Rotation Fund, which remains. The ETF has $4 million, and the fund has about $50 million. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF will be liquidated on December 15, 2025. Apparently, the Fidelity Digital Health ETF has declared digitally terminal and is expected to liquidate on or about November 20, 2025. Fidelity SAI Municipal Bond Index Fund is expected to liquidate on or about November 12, 2025. On October 16, 2025, the Board of Trustees of Fidelity Merrimack Street Trust approved the liquidation of the Fidelity Sustainable Core Plus Bond ETF on or about November 20, 2025. The flames died out for the FIRE Funds Wealth Builder ETF and FIRE Funds™ Income Target ETF on October 30, 2025. The Guardian Capital Fundamental Global Equity Fund and the Alta Quality Growth Fund will be liquidating their assets at the close of business on December 3, 2025. Humankind US Stock ETF will be liquidated on or about December 8, 2025. LeaderShares Activist Leaders ETF and LeaderShares Equity Skew ETF joined the ranks of former funds on October 30, 2025. Otter Creek Long/Short Opportunity fund and the Otter Creek Focus Strategy ETF will be liquidated on October 30th. Keith Long was one of the portfolio managers and the founder of Otter Creek Management until he passed away in August 2023. The Rayliant Quantamental China Equity ETF will be liquidated on December 5, 2025. The Saratoga Funds, Energy & Basic Materials Portfolio, the Financial Services Portfolio, and the Municipal Bond Portfolio will be liquidated on December 17, 2025. Sterling Capital Focus Equity ETF won’t be making it to Thanksgiving this year; the fund is slated to liquidate, terminate, evaporate, and eviscerate on November 24, 2025. Thrivent Core Low Volatility Equity Fund and Thrivent Core Mid Cap Value Fund ceased their thriving on October 22, 2025. Victory High Income Municipal Bond Fund will have its final opportunity to declare victory on or about December 22, 2025. Thereafter, it will be a former fund. The Shadow here!

Title: Microsoft Has Reportedly Developed “Toolkits” to Break NVIDIA’s CUDA Dominance, Slashing Inference Costs with AMD AI GPUs
URL: https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-developed-toolkits-to-break-nvidia-cuda-dominance/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T15:44:28Z
Full Content:
Microsoft is exploring ways to leverage the 'stack' of its AMD GPUs for inferencing workloads, as the company develops toolkits that convert NVIDIA CUDA models into ROCm-supported code. One of the reasons NVIDIA has managed to retain its dominance in the AI space is that the firm has a robust CUDA software ecosystem in place, which its competitors, such as AMD, cannot currently rival. Efforts have been made to allow cross-platform support of software stacks, but we haven't seen a solution that has become mainstream. However, according to a 'high-ranking' Microsoft employee, it is reported that the tech giant has developed 'toolkits' that allow the firm to run CUDA code on AMD GPUs by translating it into a ROCm-compatible version. Breaking CUDA's dominance isn't an easy task, as the software ecosystem is so integral to the AI industry that its adoption is almost ubiquitous, even in nations like China. However, Microsoft's toolkit, mentioned by the employee, likely employs a route that has been in the market for quite some time. One way to perform a CUDA-to-ROCm translation is through a runtime compatibility layer, which enables CUDA API calls to be translated into ROCm without requiring complete source code rewrites. One example of this is the ZLUDA tool, which intercepts CUDA calls, translates them into ROCm, and does so without requiring a full recompile. We built some toolkits to help convert like CUDA models to ROCm so you could use it on an AMD, like a 300X. We have had a lot of inquiries about what is our path with AMD, the 400X and the 450X. We're actually working with AMD on that to see what we can do to maximize that. However, due to ROCm still being a relatively 'immature' software stack, there are several API calls or pieces of code in CUDA that have no mapping with AMD's software, which, in some cases, collapses the performance, which is a high-risk problem in large datacenter environments. Another possible variant of the toolkit being mentioned here is likely an end-to-end cloud migration tool that integrates with Azure, targeting both AMD and NVIDIA instances. Of course, this does bring problems when conversions happen on a large scale, but by the looks of it, the toolkits developed by Microsoft appear to be in confined use. Now, the reason why Microsoft is pursuing the 'software conversions' here is simply because the firm is seeing an increase in inference workloads, and the company is looking for a more cost-effective workload, which is why AMD's AI chips make sense here, since they are the only counterpart to the 'pricey' NVIDIA GPUs. And since you cannot leave out CUDA models across inference environments, the translation from it to ROCm becomes the next big step for Microsoft.

Title: Why Sam Altman Won't Be on the Hook for OpenAI's Spending Spree
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rashishrivastava/2025/11/07/why-sam-altman-wont-be-on-the-hook-for-openais-massive-spending-spree/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T14:33:00Z
Full Content:
Over the last few months, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on a tear of dealmaking, announcing multibillion dollar agreements with the biggest tech companies in the world. There’s Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Broadcom, and most recently, Amazon. He’s committed to spending a grand sum total of $1.4 trillion on datacenters in the coming years — an eyebrow-raising figure for a company which claims its annual revenue is projected to reach $20 billion this year, begging an all-important question for the entire tech industry, whose fate is now tied to OpenAI: What happens if he can’t pay? At an event this week, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar seemed to suggest that the government could act as a “backstop” for the company’s commitments — comments she later walked back. And in a long-winded post on X, Altman addressed the question of what happens to OpenAI if its web of deals falls apart: “If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “...We of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.” The odds don’t look great right now. In order to come through on its compute commitments, OpenAI’s revenue would have to grow to an estimated $577 billion by 2029, roughly the size of Google’s revenue that same year, Tomasz Tunguz, a general partner at Theory Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post. That’s a roughly 2900% jump from its current projections for 2025. But OpenAI has options. One likely scenario is that the AI company pays for and utilizes only a portion of the compute it has booked, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. In that case, companies like Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, CoreWeave and others will most likely renegotiate the contracts and ensure they get at least some amount of business from OpenAI, especially if the alternative is getting none at all. “They don't want OpenAI to go bankrupt, so their incentive is to renegotiate,” he told Forbes. “He’s taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” Renegotiating contracts isn’t uncommon in the data center world. These contracts are extremely complex and often spread out over a span of years; some parties can even further extend timelines in case companies aren’t able to meet commitments. Clients like OpenAI are typically billed on the basis of usage. The “big numbers” being announced are often larger than what’s actually committed under contract, largely due to variables like share price, data center construction cost and GPU price, data center expert Daniel Golding said. For instance, OpenAI has committed to buy up to 6 GW of AMD’s chips (estimated to be worth around $90 billion) in exchange for about 10% of AMD shares—no cash on either side. But that hinges on performance milestones for OpenAI’s technology and commercial business as well as AMD’s share price. The contracts often have some capital I ifs. Thanks to constraints on power supply and chip availability, there’s a possibility that some of these infrastructure providers aren’t able to deliver in time, another opportunity for OpenAI to weasel out of paying some of the top line number. OpenAI’s $22.4 billion in total contracts with CoreWeave, for instance, can be terminated by either party at any time “for cause” (legal speak for things like delays). But even with about a trillion dollars on the line, the bigger risk in Altman’s mind is not having access to enough cheap compute to train and run better AI models when the time comes— a move that is crucial for revenue growth. “We believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much,” he said, adding that the company is also exploring ways to sell compute to other companies directly, much like CoreWeave does. When reached for comment, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said the company has “nothing to add.” Altman’s fixation on grabbing as much gargantuan compute as he can is not surprising. He has always knelt at the altar of scaling laws. Earlier this year, Altman mused on the coming of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the company’s overarching goal of creating AI that matches or surpasses human capabilities. “The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it,” he wrote, noting you could get “continuous and predictable gains” from pumping money into those resources. “The scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude,” he wrote. Even before ChatGPT was released, he told employees at his crypto-cum-identity company Worldcoin (now called World), that one of his personal operating principles is “scale it up and see what happens,” something he’s found effective with everything from large neural networks to fusion reactors, Forbes reported. And the faster the better. Scaling up “earlier than it makes sense to … is super, super valuable,” he told Worldcoin employees. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them.’” Experts note chief dealmaker Altman doesn’t have anything to lose. He has repeatedly claimed he does not have a stake in the company, and won’t have a stake even after OpenAI has restructured to become a public benefit corporation. “He has the upside, in a sense, in terms of influence, if it all succeeds,” said Ofer Eldar, a corporate governance professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. “He's taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” That’s not good corporate governance, according to Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. “We allow leaders that we see as being super pioneering to behave idiosyncratically, and when things move in the opposite direction and somebody has to pay, it's unclear that they're the ones that are going to have to pay,” she said. Luria adds: “He can commit to as much as he wants. He can commit to a trillion dollars, ten trillion, a hundred trillion dollars. It doesn't matter. Either he uses it, he renegotiates it, or he walks away.” There are of course more indirect stakes for Altman, experts said, like the reputational blow he’d take if the deals fall apart. But on paper, he’d seemingly be off the hook, they said. As OpenAI has grown in prominence, tech giants have clamored to strike deals with the AI behemoth. “More of the world wants to work with us, so deals are quicker to negotiate,” Altman said recently. And they’ve reaped the upsides: Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom gained a collective $636 billion in market cap on the days their deals were announced. Most recently, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion AI infrastructure deal with Amazon on Monday, the company’s stock increased 4%, adding $10 billion to Jeff Bezos’ net worth. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them,’” Luria said. Companies involved in these circular deals have already indicated they’re willing to bail each other out. In September, Nvidia said it would buy CoreWeave’s unsold computing capacity through 2032, initially worth $6.3 billion. Presumably, that could expand to include anything OpenAI doesn’t use given that it’s CoreWeave’s largest customer. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank,” said Lloyd Walmsley, a Mizuho analyst who covers Meta, Google and Amazon. “ Everyone's holding hands and, and having this leap of faith that the products are so powerful.” It’s also possible that OpenAI uses all the compute it has booked, and needs more. In that case, the AI titan will need to raise more funding—either through private or public markets—and increase its revenue exponentially. Part of why Altman has spoken about a potential OpenAI IPO is that it would make raising cheaper debt much easier. Altman said on Thursday that he’s confident that revenue will continue to grow, primarily from upcoming enterprise products and categories like robotics and consumer devices. Then, take the extreme case. If OpenAI were to file for bankruptcy protection, who would get paid first? Who would, in Sam Altman’s words, “get burnt”? For one, it’s entirely possible that some cash-rich company, perhaps one on the other end of one of its big contracts like Microsoft or Oracle, buys it in a fire sale. In the very unlikely event OpenAI goes bankrupt and liquidates instead, debtholders would get their money back first. Then equity investors, and finally—if there’s anything left over—common shareholders. OpenAI has only announced one debt deal so far, a $4 billion credit facility with nine banks including JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The company announced the loan in October 2024 and said it is a revolving credit facility (akin to a giant corporate credit card). It’s unclear if OpenAI has additional debt, which it isn’t required to disclose as a private company. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.” King among OpenAI’s equity holders is Microsoft, which owns 27% of the company following OpenAI’s restructuring as a for-profit company last week. Microsoft has invested $11.6 billion of its $13 billion commitment to OpenAI, and OpenAI has committed to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft Azure’s compute services over the coming years. The companies have two-way plans to share revenue. “Of the dominoes that are going to fall when OpenAI can't pay everybody [and the question arises of] who gets paid first, and I'd argue that Microsoft gets paid first,” Luria added. Other large shareholders include Thrive, SoftBank, Dragoneer and investors in the $6 billion merger between Jony Ive’s io and OpenAI. Common shareholders—employees, cofounders and the nonprofit—would get what’s left, proportionally to how much they paid for their shares. Interestingly, OpenAI’s nonprofit holds a special “Class N” common share, which gives it majority voting and veto power in elections of board directors, though that share isn’t entitled to any financial return if the company were to go under. (The nonprofit’s 26% stake likely also includes ordinary common shares.) Altman’s wheeling and dealing is nothing short of mind-boggling, though many of the biggest payments aren’t due for a few years. In the AI universe, that’s plenty of time to figure out how he’s going to pay for it all, whether it’s additional fundraising or explosive revenue growth. Seems like nobody knows the answer just yet, not even him.

Simultaneous audio between two USB-C sources, 3.5mm, and Bluetooth, support for literally every gaming platform, premium materials, ANC, 30-hour swappable batteries, a desktop digital audio controller, and superb audio. The only issues amount to minor nitpicks, but you're going to need to really, REALLY want those extra features to justify that sky-high price tag. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is the best headset I've ever reviewed. Top shelf build quality and comfort Industry-leading device versatility Immaculate, peerless audio Retractable mic with ANC Handy DAC with great features Monster battery life Premium specs means premium price Software is a bit slow and could be improved Materials make it a fingerprint magnet Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. $599.99. That's how much the latest effort from SteelSeries will set you back. And it's a price tag that's impossible to overlook. This is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite. It joins other products that share the "Elite" branding, such as the Xbox Elite Controller, targeting users on the high end. Gamers span all sorts of purchasing power capabilities these days, and companies know it. For those with cash to burn, building products that can seemingly do everything while also sporting the most premium materials is a segment manufacturers are increasingly targeting. The Arctis Nova Elite unashamedly joins that market as the best Xbox headset for pure, decadent luxury. As a humble games blogger, I'm not sure there's a universe where I would (or even could) ever pay $599.99 for a headset, practically under any circumstances — but if I could afford it, it would absolutely be for this headset. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is undeniably the most luxurious gaming headset I have ever used, whose features and quality inarguably justify that sky-high price tag. But you're going to be a very specific type of gamer to want to buy in here. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by SteelSeries. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. For over a decade, I've been reviewing headsets of all shapes and sizes. I've tried earbuds, budget gaming headsets, and premium cans for enthusiasts. I keep all of the headsets I review for active comparisons, and could probably open my own headset store if this tech blogging lark ever folds. One thing that won't fold is my enthusiasm for recommending YOU the best Xbox and PC headsets for your use cases. As for this headset, I've also been using the previous Arctis Nova as my daily driver. How does this one compare? Read on. You know the price already. It's a beefy boy, but what about the specs to match it? Let's take a look. This is premium from every angle you look. This is a hi-res certified headset, which means it's verified by independent organizations as being able to deliver sound beyond a typical CD. This is 24-bit/96 kHz signals specifically, and to do that, requires a higher grade of engineering and materials. As far as I could tell, this is the first wireless gaming headset to achieve this standard — a level typically reserved for audiophile products and studio-grade gear.

While premium materials definitely had a role to play here, this headset also boasts some of the most impressive versatility we've ever seen in a gaming headset. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Arctis Nova Elite's powerful digital audio controller looks unassuming on your desk, but it boasts monstrous capabilities. It's your platform for hot-swapping and keeping batteries charged up (with each of the 2 included cells offering up to 30 hours of playback). It also lets you mix audio signals from four different sources: two USB-C, one 3.5mm line-in, and one Bluetooth 5.3. This is the first headset that has offered the ability to mix Xbox, PS5, and PC audio simultaneously since SPDIF fell out of fashion as a result — something game streamers using consoles and capture cards might appreciate. Even the packaging is premium here, as SteelSeries guns for the audiophile and enthusiast gamer segment. It's as expensive as some Xbox Series X and PS5 models at $599.99, and it seems to have good stock levels across the board as of writing. Does the Arctis Nova Elite stick the landing? Absolutely yes, in (almost) every regard. And luckily, the parts that could be improved are software in nature and can be updated. Here are more details on the experience. When I opened up the package to this headset, I immediately knew I was about to experience something special. This is by far and away the most expensive headset I have ever reviewed, and its premium presentation will immediately command your attention. The packaging is accented in gold and comes in a sort of monolithic box as if it had descended from another planet. The Arctis Nova Elite sports a familiar design if you've seen the predecessor Arctis Nova Pro (my previous primary driver here), complete with a retractable mic, detachable magnetic side-plates housing USB-C connectivity and the battery bay, as well as a floating headband. What sets it apart is that every aspect of it is dialled up to 11. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The dials, buttons, and materials all sport a very luxurious feel. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The leatherette earcups feel incredibly comfortable, and dare I say, dreamy on the skin, easily defeating fabric-clad rivals. The floating headband is also an easy win for long, long periods of use, and retains SteelSeries' tradition for cranial comfort. One weird downside of the floating headband is that it's easy to rock the headset off your head if you get a little too immersed in the music (and immersed you will, the sound delivery on this headset is immense). It's designed for long gaming sessions at the end of the day, but it's worth being aware of. Returning is the retractable boom microphone, which now cleverly has per-configuration settings. When you retract it, you can still use it for calls, and it'll beamform your voice similar to earbuds. When you extend it, it functions as a high-quality mic for comms and potentially even light content creation. I'm not sure I'd record a full YouTube video on this mic over my Elgato XLR, but it's up there with the best gaming headset mics I've used. Indeed, the ability to retract the mic and fall back to Bluetooth 5.3 gives you lifestyle usability here that many other "gaming" headsets don't really offer. The subtle design on the black model means it won't look out of place when used during commutes or on a plane, and there's even an alternative colorway that fits a more Apple-style grey fashion aesthetic, too. The only criticism I'd offer here from a "lifestyle" perspective is that, perhaps, the logos are a bit "loud" for this type of use case. There are after-market sideplates you can buy that look a little more subtle, though, or even louder ones if you prefer. The World of Warcraft Horde ones are out of stock, though (dang.) Also, the soft-touch plastics SteelSeries opted for here tend to be fingerprint magnets too, which isn't a big deal, but on the black model, it can be pretty noticeable. When you're knee deep in corpses in a Battlefield 6 map or rocking to Nirvana while writing a gaming headset review on the internet (meta), you're likely not thinking about the side plates or fingerprints, though. How's the audio? It's fan-expletive-tastic. Let's not beat around the bush here. The Arctis Nova Elite is the most immaculate audio experience I've had in over a decade of gaming headset reviews. I put them directly head-to-head with a family member's studio-grade Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO and was quite stunned to find the experience pleasantly comparable. This is a gaming headset, but I've found myself using it primarily for music over the past few weeks. Rediscovering new details in soundscapes I know very well has been incredibly fun with this product, as someone who generally uses earbuds or other random gaming headsets for music typically. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. There's no distortion, no glitching, no artifacting, no muddiness, no range is overbearing or under-represented — it's simply hard to go back to anything else after using these. ANC helps eliminate background noise on planes, trains, and buses, and easy on-ear controls and a solid mobile app make them a winner for commuters. Indeed, you have multiple ways to connect to this headset, too. As noted, the digital audio controller will sit at your desk and politely allow you to connect up not one, but actually three sound sources, on top of a fourth Bluetooth signal directly into the headset. And yes, you can mix them all simultaneously. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. The vast majority of users won't need this, but as a game streamer that uses a laptop and an Xbox with a capture card, I've found it incredibly welcome to not need to Bluetooth to my TV to get game audio (but you can still do that if you want?!). The headset is heavily configurable, too. The Steelseries GG software on PC and mobile devices allows you to load up from a huge array of presets for various games, more so than any other headset I've tried. Even obscure games are represented here, which is impressive. The only downside is that you can't really delete any of the presets, nor favorite the ones you prefer. It can be a pain going back and forward between a gaming preset and a music preset, for example — but it's easily fixable. The software on PC in general could use a variety of improvements, as it sometimes hangs and features app downloads and things most people are doubtlessly unlikely to use (why would I need to download Discord from SteelSeries?). But, this is quite honestly my only gripe with the feature set, and thankfully, software is a comparably easy fix over a hardware flaw. This headset has no hardware flaws. The first iteration of the Arctis Nova Pro had a protrusion in the left ear that could get uncomfortable across long sessions, for example, but there's no such issue here. Maximum comfort, with maximum longevity, and superb, immaculate audio. For gaming, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite continues to excel. Games like Battlefield 6 and Overwatch absolutely sing on this device, giving away enemy positions with powerful tactical awareness, all without detracting from the more immersive sound design of the various virtual warzones we inhabit. The amount of tweaking you can do is impressive, too. Pushed to its extremes, the bass can get obnoxiously punchy if you want it to, or leave it thick and creamy, all while retaining maximum clarity and separation. Instruments sound like real instruments on this headset, which might sound like an odd thing to say — but you really feel the physicality of a kick drum or the slide of a bass string in this soundscape. Imagine how that translates to games with high-quality audio design, with explosions and gunfire zipping all around you. It's difficult to compare this to other gaming headsets as a result. The Arctis Nova Elite is just sublime. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The microphone experience is good, too. As you can hear in the clip above, you're looking at crystal clear comms with the microphone extended, and very good call quality when it's retracted. You can set per-config sidetone too. The sidetone quality isn't the best, but it's more than adequate for game comms. All up, it's hard to find things to gripe about here. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The number of settings you can alter and control is intuitive to set up and access, even if the software itself can be a bit slow at times. And hey, it can (and will) be updated. This headset is an absolute winner, but ... it's hard to look past that price point. There's pretty much no other headset that competes with the Arctis Nova Elite. On pure audio alone, the Arctis Nova Elite stands out in its own class and is more closely comparable to other hi-res headsets that typically don't fall into the gaming category. The only other headset with this kind of wireless versatility is the Astro A50 (2025), and the Arctis Nova Elite has it utterly beaten on raw audio, comfort, and lifestyle versatility. The Astro A50 is a pure gaming headset, though, and shaves $300 off the asking price to boot. I think, unless you were planning to use this headset everywhere and anywhere as a lifestyle option, you might get more bang for your buck with the similarly versatile Astro A50 ... but you wouldn't get the sound quality, multi-USB source mixing, or hot-swappable batteries. There's simply no real comparison here. The Arctis Nova Elite is well and truly in a category of its own. The Arctis Nova Elite is the ultimate gaming headset. It's the ultimate everything headset, frankly, able to easily accommodate high-end gaming, multi-device mixing for content creation, and day-to-day lifestyle use with ANC and Bluetooth. Its hi-res certification isn't just a sticker; it's immediately recognizable the second you commit a current to this headset. The sound reproduction puts the Arctis Nova Elite thoroughly in a category of its own, with few, if any, comparable peers. But boy howdy, it ain't cheap. You're going to either need to be a true all-day audio enthusiast, particularly fiscally affluent, or (like me) a poor financial planner to justify buying this. In my headset reviews, I tend to put a big emphasis on value for "most" people. Most of us are unlikely to look at a $599.99 headset and ever consider it an option — myself included. But with this, hearing is believing. It's one of the best headsets around. I've used my Arctis Nova Pro as my "daily" headset for several years at this point, and aside from some cushion wear, it's as good as it was the day I got it (and the cushions are easily replaced, too). If you were planning to use this headset for years and years, I think even the more budget-conscious could consider this headset, particularly if you wanted something you could use everywhere and anywhere. At the same time, would you feel comfy taking a $599.99 headset on the subway in that situation? I'm not sure I would. This headset is targeting a very specific type of customer unashamedly, and given what it offers, it's hard to penalize it for its price tag alone. The price makes sense given what's on offer. Whether or not it makes sense for your budget entirely depends on you and your needs. One thing I do know is you absolutely will not be disappointed. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a best-in-class headset boasting supreme versatility, comfort, audio, and specs. It also boasts a supreme price tag, shrugging off affordability for maximum features and luxury. You're either going to really want all of its features or have cash to burn to justify this headset, but either way, you won't be disappointed.

Title: Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle is Dead, Here’s Why Bull Run is Not Over

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Bitcoin price has seen a significant pivot from its historic 4-year cycle that is supported by halving events. Science Author, Shanaka Anslem Perera, on X, pointed out that Bitcoin has pivoted from its historic 4-year cycle, which is driven by halving events. As a result of this shift, the coin’s traditional playbook of significant positive momentum has now become obsolete. Still, the crypto enthusiast does not think that Bitcoin’s bull run is over. Historically, Bitcoin’s performance has followed a four-year cycle, largely driven by halving events, which result in a reduction in the block reward. At every point in this cycle, the crypto ecosystem experienced a massive bull run, followed by sharp price corrections. Fast forward to the present day, and there seems to be a notable shift that has now rendered this traditional playbook obsolete. On October 6, 2025, Crypto Twitter declared Bitcoin’s cycle peak at $126,270. Then this was followed by a 21% drop in the coin’s price levels. BITCOIN’S 4-YEAR CYCLE JUST DIED AND NOBODY NOTICED Crypto Twitter exploded calling October 6th the cycle peak. Eighty-four percent crashes incoming. Bear market confirmed. Pack it up. Except the math says they are catastrophically wrong. Every indicator that called previous… pic.twitter.com/b6sj1kGn5e — Shanaka Anslem Perera ⚡ (@shanaka86) November 8, 2025 As a result, several influencers and analysts, armed with historical patterns, predicted an 84% crash and a prolonged bear market. However, Perera believes that there may be a different story to tell. There may still be hope, as he claims that the bull run is far from over. Apparently, key indicators such as the Pi Cycle, MVRV Z-Score, and Puell Multiple, which would usually signal the onset of a bull run, are unusually quiet. According to these metrics, the crypto market is in a mid-cycle consolidation, and not the end of the road. Perera believes that Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) may have played a vital role in redirecting the four-year cycle. Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed a staggering $64 billion, with giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and corporate treasuries acting as a vacuum for every whale dump. The influx of institutional investors into the sector may have rid Bitcoin of certain rollercoasters. On November 4, Coinspeaker reported that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of up to $186.5 million, led entirely by BlackRock’s IBIT. Within the last six days leading up to November 7, there were consistent outflows totaling $660 million. Within the last 24 hours, the sector has seen up to $240 million flood back into ETFs. In the wake of this situation, the Bitcoin price has recovered by 2.38% and is currently trading at $101,997.13. Consequently, Market experts have concluded that settlement, not sentiment, now governs Bitcoin’s price. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: Data-center operator CoreWeave is a stock-market darling. Bears see its finances as emblematic of an AI infrastructure bubble
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/coreweave-earnings-debt-ai-infrastructure-bubble/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. A vast data center in Plano, Texas, is a symbol of the enormous AI infrastructure boom that has boosted stock markets and driven U.S. economic growth over the past year. The data center occupies more than 450,000 square feet and cost $1.6 billion to construct and equip. It supplies 30 megawatts of computing power to train and run AI models. Yet the company that runs it is a leading candidate to be ground-zero for a future AI financial meltdown. The data center is one of dozens around the world operated by CoreWeave, a company that develops and manages data centers and sells their computing capacity to technology companies. Its business is at the center of the AI economy—providing computing power to meet the voracious demand of the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI. But CoreWeave doesn’t own the Plano facility, nor does it own most of the data hubs it’s operating. And that is a part of the problem. The company is built, by its own admission, on a mountain of debt—obligations it has piled up as it races to build out a network of server farms for its customers. And that mountain looms far larger than the piles of cash that CoreWeave has brought in the door so far. When the company announces earnings on Monday, bulls and bears alike will be watching to see how its revenue is growing, and whether it has been able to pare its losses. CoreWeave’s earnings are likely to be a bellwether for the state of the entire AI boom, and for the industry’s massive and expensive infrastructure buildout in particular. CoreWeave has $7.6 billion in current liabilities—bills that fall due within 12 months—on its balance sheet, and $11 billion in debt overall, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report, filed in August. Coming from a tech giant like Google or Microsoft with tens of billions in free cash flow, such numbers wouldn’t raise an eyebrow. But CoreWeave’s revenues were only $1.9 billion in 2024. On its Q2 earnings call, CEO Michael Intrator told analysts that full year 2025 revenue would land between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. On the same call, the CEO said he expected CoreWeave’s capex for the year would total between $20 billion and $23 billion. Those short-term figures pale beside a bigger and potentially more onerous obligation that isn’t on its balance sheet: the $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. Many of those payments are stretched over relatively long terms, of 10 years or more. Still, some of this is for data centers and office buildings that have not yet begun to operate or bring in revenue—representing a vulnerability if any of the as-yet-unprofitable startups CoreWeave sells computing services to are unable to meet their contractual obligations, or if construction delays mean CoreWeave is not able to provide capacity on time, allowing customers to cancel contracts. In a sense, Coreweave is a metaphor for the broader AI industry at the present moment, as top companies commit to enormous capex spending today in the confidence that it’ll be justified by future revenue from AI platforms and services. Investors appear to be broadly convinced by the company’s narrative: CoreWeave’s stock price is up 160% since the company’s IPO in March. But Fortune’s analysis of CoreWeave’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are laced with warnings and caveats, show how risky the company’s business model could be. In interviews with several analysts, bulls and bears agreed that CoreWeave’s fundamentals, as reflected in its filings, don’t currently add up. “A lot has to go right,” says Thomas Blakely, a managing director of software equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald, who rates CoreWeave “overweight.” (Of 26 equity analysts who currently cover the stock, 14 had the equivalent of buy or outperform ratings on the shares, while nine had “hold” ratings, and three had “underperform” or “sell” recommendations, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence.) The bears see CoreWeave as a strong candidate to find itself underwater with its mounting liabilities, making it potentially the first domino to fall in the AI ecosystem. “To say they’ll scale out of this is questionable,” says Gil Luria, the head of technology research at the investment firm D.A. Davidson. “I don’t see how it becomes more profitable.” He believes that the likeliest outcome for CoreWeave on a five-year time horizon is bankruptcy—either because its current customers will be able to rely on their own infrastructure by then, or because an increasingly stretched CoreWeave will no longer be able to borrow. In a statement to Fortune, a company spokesperson said that “CoreWeave’s capital structure and financial performance are strong and underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts signed with the world’s leading enterprises and AI labs who partner with CoreWeave because we deliver the best AI cloud.” The statement went on to say that the company structured its contracts to “support and repay any related debt obligations while generating additional free cash flow. CoreWeave operates in a supply-constrained market where demand far exceeds capacity, and our hyper-growth is evidence of the trust leading companies place in us to power their most critical AI workloads.” With the company continuing to make huge new spending commitments even as it books new future revenue, AI investors’ attention will be glued to its upcoming quarterly earnings report. One number that everyone will be watching is CoreWeave’s “remaining performance obligations,” or RPOs—essentially revenues that CoreWeave has booked but that have not yet been paid. (Like its scheduled lease payments, CoreWeave’s RPOs are excluded from its balance sheet.) If CoreWeave is booking the kinds of contracts that will pull it out of debt sooner rather than later, the RPOs level—and the forecast for how quickly those future bookings are likely to turn into actual cash—are where they would show up. The company has announced several major new deals since its last quarterly earnings announcement, including a $14.2 billion agreement to supply Meta with computing capacity, and an pact with AI startup Poolside for a data center stuffed with 40,000 Nvidia GPUs. So it is likely its RPO total will climb significantly. Wall Street analysts’ forecasts for the company’s 2026 revenue range from $10.9 billion to $14.9 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.Bulls argue that this is exactly how the boom will play out in CoreWeave’s favor: The revenue will come through, in great quantity, and its scale will solve the company’s problems by catching up with and then outpacing its capital expenditures. In that scenario, the company becomes the next Levi Strauss or Amazon Web Services, providing the “picks and shovels” of the AI boom, and getting filthy rich. “The potential is beyond the scope of our imagination at this point,” says Kevin Dede, a senior technology analyst at the financial services firm H.C. Wainwright, which rates CoreWeave a “buy.” But for now CoreWeave is miles away from being profitable and is bleeding cash, absent its ability to issue debt. The RPOs it reported in its most recent earnings that are likely to be realized in the next 12 months are not, on their own, sufficient to cover its current obligations and announced growth plans (more on that shortly). The company has razor-thin operating margins—1.6% in the past quarter. After accounting for its large interest expenses, those margins turn sharply negative. The company lost more than $600 million on $2.2 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025. “That’s not great,” Luria says. “Is there any way that gap closes?”Barring an enormous surge in revenue over the next 12 months or so, the company will likely need to borrow more money, or renegotiate with creditors, in order to cover the obligations already on its books. To be sure, the AI boom could deliver that revenue surge—but even slight weakening in spending growth across the industry could hit CoreWeave disproportionately. Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm that is shorting the stock, is pithy in its conclusions: CoreWeave, it wrote in a September report, is “the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.” CoreWeave began as a crypto-mining company, a side project of a few friends who were hedge-fund traders. Crypto mining, like AI, relies heavily on graphic processing units, or GPUs, with the chips racing to solve complicated algorithms that spit out currency rewards for correctly verifying blockchain transactions, and CoreWeave was a steady buyer. Over time, Brian Venturo, one of the company’s founders, realized that the rise in AI would be a major factor fueling the surge in demand for the computing power of the GPUs that CoreWeave was already accumulating. Beginning in October 2021, CoreWeave entered into two deals with asset management firm Magnetar Capital, raising first $50 million in convertible notes, and then a year later, an additional $125 million, also in convertible notes. The company used nearly all of it to buy GPUs from Nvidia. Over the next few years, CoreWeave would secure billions of dollars in a combination of debt and equity, building out a sprawling array of data centers across the U.S., and eventually expanding to the U.K. This March, CoreWeave’s IPO made it one of the closest things to a pure-play AI company to debut on public markets. Initially, fears about the company’s debt load restrained its stock’s performance. But its shares took off in May after it reported its first quarterly earnings, including soaring revenue growth of 420% quarter-on-quarter. While the price has declined since a peak in June, CoreWeave shares closed on Friday at $104, up from a debut of $40. But as Luria puts it, the bear case for CoreWeave is simple math. The company’s business model is to borrow capital and then use that capital to build data centers filled with GPUs and then sell time on those GPUs to AI companies. “The question is, are they getting a sufficient return … on their investment to justify the interest they’re paying on their debt?” Luria says. Its most recent filings show how hefty that debt has become. The problem isn’t just the amount of CoreWeave’s debt. It’s the structure—most of it is more expensive than average for corporate debt, and much of it comes due in the next nine months. Of CoreWeave’s current liabilities, $3.6 billion is debt payable by June 30, 2026, just part of $11 billion in overall debt the company carries on its balance sheet. Much of that debt carries hefty interest rates of between 9% and 15%, according to the financial statements, with 11% being the weighted average rate overall. (This fall, rates on newly issued investment-grade corporate debt have hovered between 5.5% and 6%, according to Moody’s. The rate at which CoreWeave is able to borrow has come down over time, with most of its newer debt issued at closer to 9%. ) The majority of CoreWeave’s outstanding debt, its statements show, is in the form of two loans, called Delayed Draw Term Loan (DDTL)1.0 and DDTL 2.0. There is $1.8 billion outstanding on the DDTL 1.0, at a 15% interest rate, and $5 billion in DDTL 2.0, at an 11% interest rate. The company has begun payment on DDTL 1.0; quarterly principal payments on DDTL 2.0 are due beginning in January 2026. (The interest rates on both these loans are floating.) This is where the company’s RPOs come in. CoreWeave says that as of June 30 it had a little over $30 billion, the majority of which should turn into actual sales over the next four years. The company says 50% of that amount, or $15 billion, will be recognized in the next two years. Assuming half of that will in turn be recognized in the next year, that means the company should have $7.5 billion coming in. But if its operating margins remain at just 1.6%, the company will only generate $120 million in income from this $7.5 billion—not enough to cover its interest expenses or make the principal repayments on its debt. That implies that CoreWeave’s returns remain far below the cost of its capital. Higher RPOs, of course, would mean more revenue for CoreWeave next year. That said, there are also far more capital expenses to come. CoreWeave continues to spend heavily to purchase Nvidia GPUs—which make up the great majority of its capital expenditures—and other equipment to outfit its data centers. In the first half of 2025, for example, it invested $4.7 billion in property, plant and equipment while bringing in only $2.2 billion in revenue. The report from Kerrisdale cites similar concerns as Luria in justifying its short position. CoreWeave is “a debt-fueled GPU rental business with no moat, dressed up as innovation,” the firm writes, arguing that the stock faces a 90% downside. Luria and Kerrisdale both cite CoreWeave’s highly concentrated customer base as another potential peril—a reality that CoreWeave itself acknowledged in its last earnings report. “A substantial portion of our revenue is driven by a limited number of our customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, spend from one or a few of our top customers would adversely affect our business,” the company wrote. Most notably: In the second quarter of 2025, an eye-popping 71% of CoreWeave’s revenue came from Microsoft alone. To be sure, Microsoft has a better credit rating than many countries, including the United States, and is unlikely to renege on its contract with CoreWeave. And CoreWeave’s contracts with its lessees generally require them to pay to the ends of their leases even if they don’t wind up utilizing them, except in case of “nonperformance.” Much of CoreWeave’s utility has come from offering readily available compute as those companies raced to scale up their own operations. But with Microsoft set to spend tens of billions of dollars on developing its own data centers, it may not need CoreWeave’s services in the future. “They will pay their obligations, but the likelihood of them renewing at the end of the contract is much less guaranteed,” Luria says. CoreWeave’s other major customer, OpenAI, is another matter. In March, CoreWeave entered an agreement with Sam Altman’s AI giant, with OpenAI committed to paying $11.9 billion through October 2030, with a $4 billion expansion announced in May. But OpenAI itself has made commitments far beyond its current cash flow—including commitments in the many hundreds of billions to Oracle, Nvidia and other data center providers. If OpenAI runs into any financial troubles, Luria says, CoreWeave likely wouldn’t be first to receive payments, compared to much larger OpenAI partners like Microsoft, Amazon, or even Oracle. (That’s also the case for some of the other, smaller venture-backed and loss-making AI startups CoreWeave serves, such as poolside, Cohere, and Mistral.) To rely on CoreWeave’s ties to OpenAI, he says, “You have to believe that OpenAI is going to be unbelievably successful, so much so that it can pay everybody that’s ahead in line.” All of this means there’ll be plenty at stake when CoreWeave reports earnings on Monday. The company will also be digesting a recent setback: In late October, the shareholders of Core Scientific, a crypto miner with a hoard of computing resources that CoreWeave coveted, rejected CoreWeave’s $9 billion all-stock acquisition offer. (CoreWeave will console itself with a $270 million breakup fee—an amount that will help it cover the $360 million it is expected to pay Core Scientific to lease data center capacity from it next year. Overall, CoreWeave is on the hook to pay Core Scientific some $10 billion in future lease payments over the next 12 years, which may have been one reason CoreWeave was eager to try to use its highly-valued shares to purchase Core Scientific in an all-equity deal valued at $9 billion when the offer was initially made.) The argument for CoreWeave’s success is just as simple as the math against it: AI is going to represent a transformational shift in the global economy, and CoreWeave is powering the technology’s growth. As the development of AI accelerates, so will the demand for computing power from companies aside from the hyperscalers, all hungry for the services of providers like CoreWeave. What’s more, today’s creditors may be willing to wait a little longer for that demand to materialize: The lenders behind DDTL 2.0 recently renegotiated the terms of the loan to delay the start of principal payments. Blakely, at Cantor Fitzgerald, says that CoreWeave is already diversifying its customer base, noting the recent deal with Meta. “It’s a growth business,” he says, in reference to CoreWeave’s capital expenditures. “If business is growing, you have to invest against it.” He and other bulls see a future where the company is no longer laden with debt. Once CoreWeave sheds its liabilities over the next five years, Blakely says, a growing percent of its revenue can begin coming from infrastructure that’s already paid off, boosting CoreWeave’s margins. Moreover, Blakely says that new models of chips might run more efficiently or be able to fetch a higher premium from customers, allowing CoreWeave to hold more pricing power. Blakely says that those $30.1 billion in RPOs—the revenue that has been booked but not yet delivered—are likely to increase meaningfully in CoreWeave’s next earnings, based on recently announced agreements. But the number to watch might be the additional obligations in borrowing that the company will take on to service them: If those obligations scale up alongside the booked revenue, bears say, CoreWeave still risks running out of cash unless it takes on yet more debt, raises more equity, or gets existing creditors to extend terms. Blakely acknowledges that a sustainable path forward for CoreWeave is perilous. “A lot has to go right,” he says. Still, he compares the current moment in AI to the beginning of the smartphone era, where analysts doubted Apple’s claims that it would transform global communication. “CoreWeave is a leader there in terms of this market,” Blakely says. “If they can maintain that lead … they will be able to participate in the spoils.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Coreweave’s quarterly principal payments for DDTL 1.0 would begin in January 2026; those payments have already begun. This article was updated to add a range of analysts’ projections for CoreWeave’s 2026 revenue. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: It’s not a bubble, because AI is already running the markets

AI isn’t a bubble. It’s already reshaping markets. Autonomous AI agents now drive trading, outperforming humans and rewriting how money moves. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World While the world debates whether AI is the next dot-com bubble, chasing valuations rather than implications, they’re missing the underlying innovation story. The same AI infrastructure fueling trillion-dollar bets is already rewriting how money moves. AI is no longer an investment theme. It’s the market itself. What few noticed is that the same AI infrastructure driving the headlines is already reshaping the markets from within. The invisible battle happening behind the candlesticks isn’t bulls and bears anymore; it’s between self-learning AIs that never sleep. Markets aren’t just humans using algorithms. They’re autonomous swarms fighting for milliseconds. Agents watch every market 24/7, spotting risks, debating strategies and executing without hesitation. Recent breakthroughs in AI and blockchain acceptance have created the perfect conditions for agentic markets to flourish. AI provides cognition; meanwhile, blockchain supplies trust, verification and payment rails. This offers the medium for AI agents to transact, prove, and exchange value freely. AI has crossed the chasm from stock picker to near-autonomous day trader. It learns and acts faster than any human. It spots what humans miss, predicts the move before it happens and never second-guesses itself. It’s the ultimate insider, without inflaming the SEC. It’s early days for agentic AI in trading, but make no mistake — it’s here and already moving the markets while most traders sleep. During the biggest crypto flash crash on Oct. 10, while the rest of the crypto market was in freefall, AI agents did the opposite. They stayed calm, shorted the chaos, and ended the week up 40%. They gave us a glimpse into the future of markets. One where the AI agents don’t just follow code, they respond like real traders. Some cut risk instantly. Others waited for confirmation. A few leaned into the drawdown. What’s striking is not just the gains, it’s the composure. Each AI agent made its own independent decisions, yet collectively, they converged on profitable outcomes. That’s the essence of agentic intelligence, autonomous systems learning to interpret chaos as opportunity. Companies describe similar behavior within trading desks, where agentic systems parse live data from public disclosures and feed execution layers in real-time. Over time, agents evolve from code to cognition. Autonomous systems that read markets, understand intent and execute strategies on their own. Acting like a digital hive mind, adjusting logic mid-session as markets shift around them. For years, quant funds and high-frequency traders have pitted humans plus algorithms against the market. Enter AI versus AI. Self-directed systems plan, reason and execute around the clock. What’s emerging is a battlefield of AIs — institutional, retail, and synthetic — talking to each other in real-time. When AI trades with AI, human intent disappears. Prices move on machine-to-machine negotiations, not emotion or fundamentals. The market begins to trade itself. Related: AI gives retail investors a way out of the diversification trap A majority of global trading volume now runs through algorithmic systems, estimates ranging from 60% to 89%, depending on the market. Within months, Symphony’s agentic trading layer was clearing $140 million in transactions, working with 15 of the world’s biggest financial institutions to test self-learning yield and execution agents. For decades, investing was about finding an edge. AI gives retail investors that power for the first time. Retail traders can soon deploy the same logic once reserved for billion-dollar funds. Swarm intelligence that scans arbitrage, simulates momentum, hedges risk and executes collaboratively. It’s the retail equivalent of a hedge fund in your pocket. The walls between institutional and retail finance are eroding. AI makes the 1%’s playbook accessible to the 99%. The next outperformers will deploy agentic swarms, rather than tracking indexes. AI versus AI warfare will define liquidity, volatility and price discovery. Humans will still set direction, risk tolerance and capital allocation, but won’t press the buttons. Markets will begin to self-trade in swarms of autonomous participants. Power will shift to whomever fine-tunes the feedback loops. When agents detect each other’s footprints, they’ll evolve meta-strategies, sometimes to cooperate, sometimes to manipulate one another. Trading floors are going quiet. The next generation of traders won’t shout orders; they’ll train AI agents. The winners won’t just be institutions, they’ll be retail traders who fine-tune their swarms alongside human judgment. We’re entering the agentic arms race. Markets of tomorrow won’t sleep or panic. Agentic AI will learn, evolve, compete and occasionally conspire at breakneck speed. While institutions continue to build layers of agents, retail investors face a choice. Follow the herd into AI stocks, or start training their own AI as their wing(wo)man. They won’t have an AlphaGo moment. Quiet, relentless outperformance hides in the charts, open to anyone brave enough to seize their AI agent. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World.

Title: ‘Sell Your House, Clothes And Buy XRP’ — Solana Exec’s Wild Advice Goes Viral

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana Foundation manager Vibhu Norby jumped into a heated XRP discussion on X, adding a sharp dose of humor to an already intense online conversation. The debate began when Tradeship University founder Cameron Scrubs urged followers to sell all their other crypto assets and buy XRP. Scrubs, known for extreme XRP optimism, previously predicted that XRP would surpass Bitcoin and Ethereum within five years. He reignited that vision this week, telling investors to sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, ZCash, and Dogecoin — essentially, “sell everything” — and move into XRP. The statement quickly went viral, drawing reactions from multiple crypto communities. X user Caspian responded, saying it wasn’t meant literally. He added that the point was to align belief with action — if investors truly see value in XRP, they should act with conviction. “Own your stack, protect it, and stay ready,” he wrote. Sell your house. Sell your bed. Sell your kids. Sell your cardboard box. Sell your clothes. Buy XRP. — vibhu (@vibhu) November 7, 2025 Vibhu Norby joined the thread with satire. He joked, “Sell your house, bed, kids, cardboard box, clothes, and buy XRP,” making it clear he was mocking the hype rather than endorsing it. Another user, Slorg, claimed he had already gone all in and asked what step to take next. Norby replied that the next move was to wait for major firms like BlackRock and Mastercard to tokenize trillions in assets, potentially sending XRP to $1,000. Despite the humor, the exchange highlighted the community’s real optimism about institutional involvement and the possibility of massive price growth. Ripple added fuel to the discussion by announcing a $500 million funding round at its Swell 2025 event. Investors included Galaxy Digital, Fortress, Brevan Howard, and Pantera Capital. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the investment confirmed faith in a business “built on the foundation of XRP.” Reports also showed Ripple partnered with Mastercard to use RLUSD on XRPL for fiat settlement, while Ripple Prime is integrating XRP for institutional transfers. These developments gave long-term holders more reason to stay confident in XRP. Holding XRP is the hardest part because conviction gets tested in every wave of volatility. But when you understand the fundamentals, the liquidity infrastructure @Ripple is building and how $XRP underpins the next phase of global settlement, patience becomes your leverage. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 5, 2025 Meanwhile, Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, acknowledges that it is a constant emotional struggle holding XRP. He explains how investor patience is tested in every market cycle, and the challenge of remaining dedicated to your investment when the price moves materially can be one of the hardest things to do as an XRP holder. Engineer Vincent Van Code responded, saying that it requires “serious conviction – or mental illness” to not sell when the price moves. It comes as no surprise that the mixture of irony, crazy predictions and institutional news keeps XRP relevant. For some of them, the “sell your house” comments are simply an exaggeration, but it showcases the passion and belief of the XRP community, which has planned and endorsed their position, and has continued to show the strength of their will no matter how volatile XRP price action has remained.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: JPMorgan doubles down on Bitcoin with $343M BTC bet – Details

Here’s why institutions are suddenly racing to get in. JPMorgan now holds 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, a 64% increase from last quarter. It reflects rising institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a core asset in global investment portfolios. JPMorgan is significantly ramping up its exposure to Bitcoin [BTC], highlighting a surge in institutional confidence toward the leading cryptocurrency. According to the bank’s latest 13F regulatory filing, its brokerage clients now hold 5.28 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), valued at approximately $343 million as of the 30th of September. This represents a 64% increase from the previous quarter’s 3.21 million shares. The report further reveals that JPMorgan’s exposure spans multiple divisions, including those managing high-net-worth and institutional portfolios. This broad participation reflects a strategic shift within the bank and its clients, who are seeking regulated, low-risk entry points into Bitcoin amid ongoing market fluctuations. The timing and scale of the investment signal that Wall Street’s largest players are no longer sitting on the sidelines. Instead, they are positioning themselves ahead of what they perceive as the next major leg in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption. Yet, while JPMorgan’s crypto exposure deepens, not all corporate holders are faring well. Firms like Metaplanet, a known Bitcoin accumulator, are now facing steep paper losses, holding 30823 BTC at an average purchase price of $108,036, with losses of 5.37% as per Bitcointreasuries.net data. Still, the broader institutional landscape shows resilience rather than retreat. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), for instance, continued its steady Bitcoin accumulation, recently adding 397 BTC to its reserves. This happened at a time when Bitcoin was trading around $102,260, at press time, showing modest gains, while BlackRock’s IBIT recorded $131.4 million in outflows, according to Farside Investors. Despite this, Bitcoin’s dominance stood firm at 59.84%, meaning it now represents nearly 60% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Meanwhile, in traditional markets, JPMorgan’s stock rose 0.25% to $314.21, and BlackRock climbed 1.19% to $1,082.20, according to Google Finance. These slight upticks mirror the cautious optimism in financial circles, where institutions like JPMorgan are positioning themselves to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next potential leg upward. That being said, BlackRock’s exposure is not just limited to Wall Street. In fact, the upcoming launch of iShares Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) by mid-November 2025 marks another strategic step in its global digital asset expansion. Therefore, with Australia emerging as one of the key frontiers for Bitcoin ETFs and institutional inflows surging, BlackRock’s move signals growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a core asset within global portfolios.

Title: Bitcoin mining news: Cipher lands $5.5B AWS lease, IREN inks $9.7B Microsoft deal, and public bitcoin miner Q3 earnings

It was a blockbuster week for bitcoin mining news, and the clearest sign yet that miners’ AI ambitions are entering the big leagues. Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) inked a $5.5 billion, 15-year lease with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN) for 300 megawatts at its Bear Lake facility, while IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) announced a $9.7 billion, five-year agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) for 200 megawatts of cloud compute in Texas. Hashprice tumbled to fresh lows near $40 per petahash per day, Bitcoin retraced to $101,000, and Cipher also unveiled plans for a one-gigawatt data center joint venture. And in the background, Warren Buffett’s Pacific Power failed to deliver power to Amazon, a development that could funnel even more demand toward Bitcoin miners with spare megawatts. You’re reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube. Cipher announced a 15-year, $5.5 billion lease agreement with Amazon Web Services to host AI workloads at its 300-megawatt Bear Lake facility. The site is scheduled to come online in July 2026, marking AWS’s latest move to secure long-term compute capacity amid surging AI demand. The partnership makes Cipher one of the first public Bitcoin miners to land a hyperscaler as a direct tenant. Cipher also revealed plans for a new one-gigawatt data center project dubbed “Colchis,” in which the company will retain a 95% ownership stake. Despite the historic announcement, Cipher’s stock slid more than 10% Friday, caught in a broader tech-sector sell-off. The company’s $5.5 billion deal value dwarfs its own $8 billion market cap, underscoring investor enthusiasm for miners with AI exposure. Concurrent with Cipher’s own deal, IREN signed a five-year, $9.7 billion cloud compute agreement with Microsoft to deliver 200 megawatts of critical IT load at its Childress, Texas site. The company will also collaborate with Dell in a separate $5.8 billion procurement deal to supply servers, cables, and supporting hardware for its new liquid-cooled data centers “Horizon 1” and “Horizon 4.” The twin announcements represent one of the largest combined partnerships between a Bitcoin miner and major tech firms to date. Like Cipher, IREN’s shares fell roughly 10% on the day, but analysts called the Microsoft deal a “watershed moment” for miners pivoting toward AI and HPC infrastructure. The agreement validates the “powershell” model miners are pursuing: providing power and physical infrastructure for AI tenants while leaving GPU cluster management to specialized partners. Still, open questions remain over IREN’s own GPU strategy and its 20,000-unit Neo Cloud cluster, which could serve as a proving ground for independent AI compute capabilities. Beyond the AI headlines, traditional mining economics continued to worsen. Hashprice fell to around $40 per petahash per day, levels not seen since the spring downturn following President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. Bitcoin’s price has pulled back from highs near $126,000 to roughly $101,000, with network difficulty up more than 6% in the most recent adjustment. “The streets are bleeding,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said. “Hash rice is flatlining, fees are dry, and the only excitement left in mining is AI.” The bleak trend underscores the widening gap between miners chasing compute diversification and those still dependent on Bitcoin block rewards. Q3 results from leading miners offered a snapshot of an industry in transition: With AI contracts now dictating sentiment, shares of several miners appear to be pricing in future deal flow rather than immediate mining economics. In a twist tying Warren Buffett to the week’s biggest AI news, Amazon reportedly filed a complaint against Berkshire Hathaway–owned Pacific Power for failing to deliver sufficient electricity to new data centers in Oregon. The shortfall, according to Bloomberg, has forced AWS to seek alternative partners, a potential win for miners like Cipher that already control scalable, low-cost energy infrastructure. The incident follows lawsuits against Pacific Power related to wildfire liabilities, adding pressure on the utility as hyperscalers scramble for new capacity. To close the week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned that China could overtake the U.S. in the AI arms race, citing cheaper power, looser regulations, and government-backed industrial policy. Speaking at the Financial Times’ Future of AI Summit, Huang said Western “cynicism” and fragmented state-level rules risked slowing U.S. innovation. If China continues expanding its power grid and chip manufacturing base, he said, “they will come.” For miners, that comment hit close to home. As U.S. firms repurpose Bitcoin data centers for AI, the global race for compute, and the energy to fuel it, is accelerating on all fronts. Bitcoin’s first industry publication.

And in the background, Warren Buffett’s Pacific Power failed to deliver power to Amazon, a development that could funnel even more demand toward Bitcoin miners with spare megawatts. You’re reading a recap of The Mining Pod. Watch the full episode on YouTube. Cipher announced a 15-year, $5.5 billion lease agreement with Amazon Web Services to host AI workloads at its 300-megawatt Bear Lake facility. The site is scheduled to come online in July 2026, marking AWS’s latest move to secure long-term compute capacity amid surging AI demand. The partnership makes Cipher one of the first public Bitcoin miners to land a hyperscaler as a direct tenant. Cipher also revealed plans for a new one-gigawatt data center project dubbed “Colchis,” in which the company will retain a 95% ownership stake. Despite the historic announcement, Cipher’s stock slid more than 10% Friday, caught in a broader tech-sector sell-off. The company’s $5.5 billion deal value dwarfs its own $8 billion market cap, underscoring investor enthusiasm for miners with AI exposure. Concurrent with Cipher’s own deal, IREN signed a five-year, $9.7 billion cloud compute agreement with Microsoft to deliver 200 megawatts of critical IT load at its Childress, Texas site. The company will also collaborate with Dell in a separate $5.8 billion procurement deal to supply servers, cables, and supporting hardware for its new liquid-cooled data centers “Horizon 1” and “Horizon 4.” The twin announcements represent one of the largest combined partnerships between a Bitcoin miner and major tech firms to date. Like Cipher, IREN’s shares fell roughly 10% on the day, but analysts called the Microsoft deal a “watershed moment” for miners pivoting toward AI and HPC infrastructure. The agreement validates the “powershell” model miners are pursuing: providing power and physical infrastructure for AI tenants while leaving GPU cluster management to specialized partners. Still, open questions remain over IREN’s own GPU strategy and its 20,000-unit Neo Cloud cluster, which could serve as a proving ground for independent AI compute capabilities. Beyond the AI headlines, traditional mining economics continued to worsen. Hashprice fell to around $40 per petahash per day, levels not seen since the spring downturn following President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. Bitcoin’s price has pulled back from highs near $126,000 to roughly $101,000, with network difficulty up more than 6% in the most recent adjustment. “The streets are bleeding,” Mining Pod analyst Matt Kimmel said. “Hash rice is flatlining, fees are dry, and the only excitement left in mining is AI.” The bleak trend underscores the widening gap between miners chasing compute diversification and those still dependent on Bitcoin block rewards. Q3 results from leading miners offered a snapshot of an industry in transition: With AI contracts now dictating sentiment, shares of several miners appear to be pricing in future deal flow rather than immediate mining economics. In a twist tying Warren Buffett to the week’s biggest AI news, Amazon reportedly filed a complaint against Berkshire Hathaway–owned Pacific Power for failing to deliver sufficient electricity to new data centers in Oregon. The shortfall, according to Bloomberg, has forced AWS to seek alternative partners, a potential win for miners like Cipher that already control scalable, low-cost energy infrastructure. The incident follows lawsuits against Pacific Power related to wildfire liabilities, adding pressure on the utility as hyperscalers scramble for new capacity. To close the week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warned that China could overtake the U.S. in the AI arms race, citing cheaper power, looser regulations, and government-backed industrial policy. Speaking at the Financial Times’ Future of AI Summit, Huang said Western “cynicism” and fragmented state-level rules risked slowing U.S. innovation. If China continues expanding its power grid and chip manufacturing base, he said, “they will come.” For miners, that comment hit close to home. As U.S. firms repurpose Bitcoin data centers for AI, the global race for compute, and the energy to fuel it, is accelerating on all fronts. Bitcoin’s first industry publication.

Title: Ethereum Price Surge To $5,500: What To Watch Out For To Mark The Bottom

Coming out of weeks of downtrend, the Ethereum price could be looking to establish the next bottom as it sets up for a campaign toward new all-time highs. This is highlighted by crypto analyst MMBTtrader, who explained that the Ethereum price crash could be coming to an end. This is evidenced by a number of formations on the Ethereum price chart that suggest where the next lift-off might begin. In an analysis shared on the TradingView website, the crypto analyst explained that the Ethereum price is now testing the next crucial technical level. The importance of this level comes with a 50% retracement of the Fibonacci sequence. Thus, it means that the Ethereum price is seeing major support at this level. This support lies just above the $3,200 level, which the Ethereum price had managed to maintain through the market crash. This puts the critical level at the 0.5 Fibonacci support, which currently serves as the next make-or-break level for the cryptocurrency. If the Ethereum price is able to bounce off from here, then it could trigger the next wave of recoveries for the cryptocurrency. Not only that, it would be the signal that the bottom is finally in and the crash is over. The analyst further explains that this could lead to “a high-probability setup for a resumption of the primary bullish trend.” Such a breakout would lead to a rather strong bullish move for the digital asset, and the target from here would be a brand new all-time high. The first target from here would be $5,500 as bulls push the price higher. “This target is derived from the magnitude of the prior uptrend and represents a key resistance zone on the higher timeframes,” the analyst explained. The 0.5 Fibonacci level, as explained above, is a make-or-break level. This means that whichever direction the Ethereum price takes after hitting this level could determine where the cryptocurrency is headed next. With the bullish side already explored, there is still the possibility that Ethereum fails to establish support and a bottom. In the event of the Ethereum price actually breaking below this crucial level, then it would confirm the bearish pressure that has plagued the market. The analyst highlights on the chart that if the support breaks, then Ethereum could dump further below $3,000, with the major support lying just above $2,400. Such a decline would mean an over 30% crash for Ethereum, on top of the already struggling price. Therefore, it is imperative that bulls hold above $3,200 to prevent further decline.

Title: Bubble Trouble: Is too much being spent on AI?
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1108/1542794-ai-bubble-tech/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T07:00:00Z
Full Content:
Adam Maguire Business Journalist Michael Burry - the man who famously spotted the US subprime mortgage crisis years before most others - thinks there's an AI bubble. This week it was revealed that he had taken a $1.1 billion bet against chip-maker Nvidia and Peter Thiel’s Palantir – where he will profit if their stock prices fall. But it’s not just professional market sceptics like Burry that think things may be overheated in tech. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, recently warned that US stocks – in particular tech stocks - are over-heated. Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs head David Soloman have also warned of an impending correction. Even big tech cheerleaders like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have said there is an AI bubble. Meanwhile Sam Altman, the head of AI revolution icon OpenAI, thinks valuations and spending has gotten carried away. Why do they think this is a bubble? You can get some clue of why if you look at the quarterly results some of the world’s big tech companies published last week. Microsoft, for example, said it spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditure in the quarter. Capital expenditure wouldn’t necessarily all be AI-related but in this case the vast bulk of it is. To put that figure into context, Ireland’s Budget 2026 was worth around €9.4 billion - or roughly $10.8 billion. So Microsoft spent more than three times Ireland’s annual budget in a single quarter. Meanwhile Facebook owner Meta said it would spend as much as $72 billion on capital expenditure this year. Google owner Alphabet said it would spend up to $93 billion. Amazon said its full year capital budget would be $125 billion this year – and even higher next year. And that’s just four of the big tech companies - it wouldn’t include AI spending by other large firms like Apple, Tesla, X, Oracle or Palantir. Nor would it include the tens hundreds of millions - or even billions - being spent by other big-but-not-massive companies. Or the money being invested by venture capitalists and private equity. And most of that money is ultimately going towards building data centres and buying high end computer chips - but it’s also being spent at employee level too. Back in June Sam Altman claimed that Meta was offering his top engineers pay packets valued at $300m if they moved over to Team Zuckerberg. That included a $100m signing-on bonus. The likes of Meta have also spent billions to buy stakes in, or acquire outright, AI startups that have promising-looking ideas. The scale of all of this is so significant that Goldman Sachs estimated that AI investment was a bigger contributor to growth in the US economy in the first half of the year than consumer spending. In fact, if you took out the money being spent on AI, the US economy was stagnant in the first half of the year. And tech companies’ valuations have risen to match – largely based on the promise and expectation that all this spending now will result in them making even more money in the not-too-distant future. Are there any signs of that happening? No - An MIT study in August found that, when you strip away all the hype, 95% of firms were getting zero return on their AI investments. It’s not entirely true to say that no-one is making money from AI… some are. Or, more specifically, one company is. So far the only clear winner from the AI race is Nvidia, which designs the computer chips that are powering all of these data centres that big tech firms are rushing to build. It’s gone from being a relatively niche player in the market to being the most valuable listed company in the world. As recently as its 2020 results, Nvidia had profits of $2.8 billion – which isn’t bad by any measure. But now, in the single quarter between May and July, it had a profit of $26.4 billion. It is now comfortably on track to make more than $100 billion in profit this year – which would be about 36 times the profit it made just a few years ago. For most others, though, it’s a different story. Despite their huge investments to date the likes of Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have yet to really show the benefit AI has brought to their bottom line. Some are pointing to it being a cost-saving measure – Amazon’s recent jobs cuts, for example, were framed as them leaning on AI to be able to reduce bureaucracy. But if that’s the rationale it will take many more cuts to justify the hundreds of billions of investment. And it’s not just the big tech companies that are struggling to make it viable – the dedicated AI creators are not seeing a return yet either. Anthropic made a $5.3 billion loss last year. Elon Musk’s xAI is predicted to record a $13 billion loss this year. Even the poster-child of AI – OpenAI – made a $5 billion loss last year. That means that every time you ask ChatGPT to compose an email for you, or ask it to devise the best scrambled eggs recipe, it’s costing them money. Despite that, there are suggestions it could be valued at $1 trillion when it floats on the New York Stock Exchange in the not-too-distant future. So if it’s not making money, what’s the justification for that valuation? OpenAI and its backers hope it is following the same kind of playbook we’ve seen from so many tech start-ups over the years. This is where it has a great idea, great technology and great people – and once it builds a big enough customer base and gains efficiencies of scale, the profits will start to flow. And, in fairness, its revenue looks to have more than doubled year on year – and it recently started to unveil a range of products and services it plans to provide – including a web-browser, which will open the door to it service ads too. In the meantime, though, they’ve also committed to invest around $1.4 trillion in other companies over the next few years – which will include buying computer chips and data centre capacity to help handle the queries from all of those extra customers. But within those deals it’s making is also an interesting dynamic that has added to concerns about an AI bubble – and that’s how a lot of the investment that’s taking place seem to be almost circular. For example, one big part of OpenAI’s recent investments was a $300 billion deal with Oracle to tap into its data centre capacity. In turn, Oracle has committed to spend tens of billions of dollars to buy Nvidia chips to power its data centres. Meanwhile, Nvidia has invested $100 billion of its money into OpenAI. Which essentially means that the three companies are passing billions of dollars around in a circle. So if this is a bubble, what happens when it bursts? Well the first thing there is the 'when’ of the when. Just because there’s a growing consensus that there is a bubble, doesn’t mean that it’s ready to pop. Going back to Michael Burry – he made his first bet against the subprime mortgage market in mid-2005; it took pretty much two years for that bet to pay off. And as readers (or viewers) of The Big Short may remember, he received a lot of flak during those two years from investors who thought he was costing them a fortune. It should also be said that, while he was right that time, he can be wrong too. He took bets out against big tech stocks in 2023 too, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen by nearly 80% since then. But assuming it is a matter of ‘when’ and not ‘if’, there are a whole range of predictions around what a burst AI bubble might mean. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has kind of downplayed his company’s exposure - saying that spending all of this money on data centres now was essentially just front-loading what they’ll need in the years ahead. So, he argues, worst case scenario it’ll just mean they’ll be futureproofed against a natural growth of demand for its services in the years ahead. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos suggested that while this is a bubble, it wouldn’t be a ‘bad’ bubble like the financial crisis. Instead he said it would be a ‘good’ bubble, comparing it to the Dot Com crash. His argument is that while a lot of companies collapsed in the Dot Com crash, a handful that had good ideas and viable models – including Amazon and Google – survived and thrived. He thinks the same will happen here – the tide will go out and expose those that can’t back up all of their big talk, but the useful platforms will stick it out and usher in big changes for the world. Of course that comparison does skirt over the negative impact this kind of ‘good’ bubble can have. All of those bankruptcies and valuation write-downs means lost investments and a shock to the stock market, which perhaps impacts people’s pensions, and likely leads to job cuts too. So it wouldn’t just be a case of adjusting a balance sheet or two and moving on. But is there the potential for contagion? Again, it depends first and foremost on how much more bubbly the bubble gets before it bursts. But no more than AI investment is feeding growth in the wider US and world economy right now, a dramatic collapse in investment and valuations in the sector will have a knock-on effect on national and global GDP too. There’s also the very practical impact of jobs cuts – direct and indirect. If it turns out that the AI industry has gotten too big and expensive, some of those being hired now will likely be let go. Meanwhile companies that see the value of their AI investments getting written down may need to make cuts elsewhere to cover their losses. It could also have a knock-on impact on areas like construction and consumer spending. And one concern around a potential AI crash relates to that circularity of investment that’s being seen at the moment. A big part of the boom in Nvidia’s revenue is based on the scramble to make use of OpenAI’s tools. Oracle’s stock price also reflects the fact that it’s been promised $300 billion of business from OpenAI in the coming years. As a major shareholder in OpenAI, Microsoft’s valuation is also boosted by the belief that Sam Altman’s firm will become massively profitable in the near future. Meanwhile Amazon has done its own multi-billion dollar deal with OpenAI to provide it with data centre capacity to power its AI platforms. That means that all of those big tech companies have a lot to gain from OpenAI’s success – and a lot to lose if it turns out that the technology isn’t nearly as useful as many hope. Its importance to these major firms has led to suggestions by some that the company is already too big to fail. Some have even started to call for it to be broken up to reduce the systemic risk it poses. That’s despite the fact that it’s currently still privately held, and still losing billions of dollars a year. Business Journalist Follow@AdamMaguire © RTÉ 2025.

Title: NetEase shuts down Bad Brain Games Studio after The Midnight Riders project fails to secure funding

In another unfortunate event in the games industry, NetEase has shuttered its Canadian subsidiary, Bad Brain Games Studios, making it the second studio to close under the publisher this week, following Fantastic Pixel Castle. Bad Brain Games, based out of Toronto, was established in 2023 and consisted of former Ubisoft developers, particularly from the Watch Dogs series. The studio confirmed it will halt operations on November 17, 2025, after failing to secure new funding or investment for its project, codenamed The Midnight Riders. Studio head Sean Crooks broke the news on LinkedIn and said, “It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors.” He explained that the studio had explored every avenue to secure external investment, but to no avail. He praised the team’s “creativity and commitment” as they “pushed creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft.” The Midnight Riders was supposed to be a retro-themed action-adventure game featuring a group of school-going teenagers, exploring mysterious worlds on bicycles and hunting down eldritch horrors with everyday objects like slingshots and baseball bats. Bad Brain Games released a small sizzle reel that drew tons of praise for the project’s art direction and intriguing gameplay. Despite the sudden halt in The Midnight Riders' development, Crooks stated that the project and its IP remain “available with acquisition or partnership.” The studio is still clinging to hope as Crooks said, “We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.” Bad Brain Games Studios consisted of nearly two dozen employees, many of whom had been poached from major studios. Unfortunately, staff members are scrambling for new opportunities amid a brutal wave of layoffs in the video game industry, which has left tens of thousands of developers out of work. Crooks wrapped up the post, stating, “Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.” This is the third NetEase-related high-profile studio shut down in recent months. The first casualty was T-Minus Zero Entertainment. Yet T-Minus Zero managed to strike a deal with a consortium of veteran directors and founders for the studio’s name and assets. Bad Brain Games Midnight Riders hangs in limbo, awaiting any interested bidder willing to revive the title. Buy Watch Dogs: Legion on Amazon Bad Brain Games Studios - Linkedin

Title: Looking for an interesting Christmas present? Start bidding for bargains at auction

As Christmas shopping season begins, savvy searchers for gifts will be browsing auction catalogues for ideas. Buying presents at auction is a sustainable shopping option, because such purchases keep things in circulation for longer. Buying at auction often also represents good value for money, although prospective buyers should always be aware that most auctioneers add 20 per cent buyer’s commission plus VAT at 23 per cent on the buyer’s commission to the hammer price. So, for example, a painting bought for a hammer price of €1,000 will cost €1,246. There can also be an extra charge for online bidding. With these caveats in mind, there are plenty of auctions in the next few weeks that are worth checking out. Take, for example, the live auction of railway memorabilia at Mullen’s showrooms in Laurel Park, Bray, Co Wicklow on Monday November 10th, starting at 11am. The lithographs, watercolours, paintings and photographs of trains and 20th-century tourist posters promoting rail travel all belonged to Col Raymond O’Neill, the Lord O’Neill, who is the current owner of Shane’s Castle, near Randalstown in Co Antrim. From the early 1970s, Shane’s Castle had its own miniature railway line running from a platform near the Antrim Gate lodge to Shane’s Castle on the shores of Lough Neagh. It closed to the public in 1994. An avid collector of all kinds of “railwayana”, from enamelled advertising signs to model train sets, train timetables, maps, postcards and guide books, the Lord O’Neill is the former chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, a past president of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland and a member of several other heritage bodies. He is the nephew of the late Terence O’Neill, former prime minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. His stepfather was Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond novels. Some buyers will be drawn to the illustrious provenance of items, while others will be enticed by their collectability. Take, for example, the colourfully illustrated travel posters Come to Ulster (€700-€1,000) or the poster for London, Midland and Scottish Railway, Connemara by the artist Paul Henry (€600-€1,200). The Dublin and Blessington Tramway passing Russborough Estate in Co Wicklow by Sean Boylan in 1924 (€400-€600) is one of several paintings of trains travelling through scenic spots in this collection. The auction also includes vintage Airfix model kits and model trains including the North Pole locomotive and carriage on a display track (€100-€200) and a collection of die-cast models of trams (€40-€80). Mullen’s timed online auction of classic and contemporary interiors also has plenty of potential Christmas gifts, with reasonable estimates on lots of glassware, crockery and paintings. The lots will begin closing on November 9th from 6pm. Meanwhile, Adam’s Blackrock is hosting an online jewellery auction of 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is now closing its doors. “The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones, ideal for both everyday wear and special occasions,” says Elena McCrory from Adam’s Blackrock. The online auction, which closes at 7pm on November 13th, is on view until Sunday November 9th from 12-4pm daily at 17 Kildare Street, Dublin. And Lynes & Lynes auctioneers in Carrigtwohill, Co Cork, is selling an eclectic range of items from several Cork residences, the recently closed Cotton Ball pub and recently closed Canty’s Garage, both in Cork City. The most striking item in the Lynes & Lynes auction has to be the 1914 Buick Tourer (€15,000-€20,000). Made by General Motors in Michigan, US, it was a luxury car at a time when motor vehicles were still relatively rare. Vintage photographic prints of Canty’s garage with delivery vehicles (€20-€30) will appeal to vintage car enthusiasts. Those seeking Christmas gifts will also have plenty to choose from at the Lynes & Lynes auction, including a set of antique glass decanters (€30-€50), Shanagarry pottery (€40-€60) and a selection of china teapots (€20-€40), all with reasonable estimates. Fans of antique fairs should note forthcoming fairs in Limerick Racecourse on November 15th and 16th and at Claregalway Castle in Co Galway on November 22nd and 23rd. Both are run by Hibernian Antique Fairs and feature dealers from the Republic and Northern Ireland. Finally, the Grace O’Malley Foundation will have a small auction at its annual fundraising lunch in the Westbury Hotel on Friday November 14th at 12.30pm. The charity provides practical home improvement supports to sick and older people struggling to survive in their own homes. The items for auction include a bronze December mask by the Irish sculptor Rory Breslin (€3,000-€5,000). A set of 14 river gods bronze masks by Breslin achieved a hammer price of €125,000 at Sheppard’s auction house earlier this year. Estimate: €2,000-€3,000 each Hammer price: €4,200 (black)/€3,200 (white) Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €6,000-€9,000 Hammer price: Not sold Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €200-€400 Hammer price: €420 Auction house: deVeres Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Title: BioWare is still working on the next Mass Effect game, the studio says in N7 Day message — "EA and BioWare remain committed."

For N7 Day 2025, BioWare shares a message reiterating that the next Mass Effect game is in development. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Role-playing game developer BioWare has traditionally shared new teases, updates, or messages to the Mass Effect player community on November 7, or "N7 Day," reflecting the in-game designation for special operatives. For N7 Day 2025, BioWare declined to share any new tidbits about its next game, instead simply reiterating that the game is coming, pushing back against recent online chatter that it's in trouble or will be cancelled. "You’ve made it clear you care deeply about what’s next. So let’s start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," the statement reads. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show."This comes as Electronic Arts' (EA's) overall game division has seen a turbulent past few months. At the start of the year, BioWare was subjected to layoffs, reducing the studio down to under 100 staff. In April, hundreds of additional workers were laid off, including some at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi developer Respawn Entertainment. More cuts came shortly after, with EA cancelling a Black Panther game and closing the developer.Now, EA has agreed to go private in a deal financed by private equity and Saudi Arabian investment, leading to concerns over the tone and content present in future games, as well as fears of additional cuts. While the next Mass Effect game was first announced with a teaser back in 2020, extremely little has been shared since then. BioWare did present a new teaser for N7 Day 2023, which showed off a new character design and hinted towards a possible game title of Epsilon (or Mass Effect 5, in a more literal sense). While there are no new tidbits regarding what players can expect from the next Mass Effect game, BioWare's update does shed some light on the long-gestating Mass Effect TV series in production at Amazon. We now know that the series will take place after the events of the original trilogy, and it is not going to be a retelling of the story of Commander Shepard.This is similar in approach to the Fallout TV series (which was also produced by Amazon), which is set years after the events of Fallout 4. I previously argued it would be a mistake to try and have a "canon" Commander Shepard and accompanying choices in the TV series, so I'm certainly happy to see BioWare confirm things won't go that way.Finally, there's a curious pattern scattered throughout the message. A few letters of different words in BioWare's blog post are italicized, and put together, they spell out "URL KROGAN."Combined with a vague post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Mass Effect account, some players quickly figured out that it linked to a new piece of artwork, presenting a Krogan civil War. The Krogan are easily my favorite race in the Mass Effect universe, so I'm already speculating about just what this event could entail.As for the message itself, while I certainly understand what BioWare is aiming to do here, it's still hard not to feel worried. I wish the team the best, and I hope things go well in the months and years to come. Mass Effect Legendary Edition compiles all three original games into one remastered package. It's a must-play for any fans of action-RPGs, and you can snag an Xbox copy for just $9 right now. See at: Loaded (formerly CDKeys) No, the next Mass Effect game does not have a release date or even the vaguest window. Extremely little is known at this time.

She transitioned into reporting while working for Rock the Vote, Future Majority and Wiretap Magazine, covering the Millennial Generation's perspective during the presidential elections. As a political writer, Burris has had bylines at CNN, Salon.com, BNR, and AlterNet and serves as a senior digital editor for RawStory.com. Women in Media Center The Nasdaq Composite had its worst week since April this week, numbers show. Market Watch attributed the flop to the tech industry and the government shutdown. Yahoo Finance cited "seesaw stretches for 'Magnificent Seven' stalwarts Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). The S&P 500 and the Dow also closed out the bumpy week in the red as persistent worries about an AI bubble and Big Tech valuations run high." MSNBC VP of editorial and bookings, Jesse Rodriguez, wrote on X, "US stock indexes are on track for their worst five-day start to November since 2008." "The Warren Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP), the Shiller CAPE ratio (stock prices to earnings), and my Dr. X bubble detector are at record highs. WHEN WILL THE BUBBLE BURST?" asked Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. "You can get people to believe a lot of things, but I guarantee you can't get them to believe grocery prices are down," said chief economist Tim Duy at SGH Macro Advisors, referring to President Donald Trump's argument that prices for everything are better. Stock associate Mike Bostic flagged concerns over the labor market, shutdown and AI bubble as the possible cause. "Ping! Is that the bubble bursting?! Bad day for American AI and tech stocks today..." said academic researcher Dr. Ian McCormick. He later added, "The selloff seems to be driven by anxiety over the ongoing US government shutdown, the resulting dearth of economic data, and warnings that an AI bubble might burst soon." In the background, "Elon will be a trillionaire. Wild," said Certified Financial Education Instructor Kalu Aja. "Thanks, Donald!" blamed media executive John Goodman.

Title: XRP Price To Reach $1,000 By End Of 2025? Rumor Mills Are On Fire With BlackRock Speculations

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Speculations across the crypto space have ignited a wave of excitement for the XRP price as rumors linking BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Ripple, a crypto payments company, continue to spread. The possibility of XRP reaching $1,000 before the end of 2025 has become the latest hot topic, fueled by bold claims from top analysts who believe that this rumored partnership could set the stage for one of the most explosive bull runs in this cycle. Crypto market analyst ‘The Real Remi Relief’ has stirred significant interest with his post on X social media, claiming that if ongoing rumors about a potential partnership between BlackRock and Ripple prove true, the XRP price could reach $1,000 by the end of 2025. He advised holders to secure their XRP in cold wallets and prepare for a potential market-wide supply shock. His optimism stems from reports shared by another well-analyst @DelCrxpto, who revealed that sources deep within the crypto industry are hinting at a major development involving BlackRock and Ripple. According to these claims, the global asset manager may be preparing to collaborate with Ripple to establish infrastructure for the tokenization of all $5.3 trillion of its ETF liquidity. If such an initiative were to materialize, it would represent one of the largest integrations of blockchain into global finance. Ripple’s network, designed for fast and cost-effective asset transfers, could provide the foundation for tokenized ETFs, potentially transforming traditional investment markets. Additionally, the crypto payments company, which is already expanding into the Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization sector, will broaden its technology and services to support a broader range of financial products. The possibility of such a partnership has reignited optimism within the XRP community, especially after the recent Ripple Swell event, which featured participation from prominent names including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Franklin Templeton, The White House, and several other global institutions. Notably, an ETF tokenization deal between Ripple and BlackRock could elevate XRP’s role in the digital asset and financial ecosystem, driving institutional adoption, which could propel its price. Despite growing optimism about XRP’s price outlook, the rumors remain unconfirmed, and neither Ripple nor BlackRock has issued any official statement. Market analyst @Steph_iscrypto has added fuel to the bullish excitement surrounding the XRP price with a technical analysis suggesting that the cryptocurrency could soon enter another parabolic phase. He announced in his X post that “XRP will shock everyone in the next 1-3 months.” His accompanying weekly chart highlights bull rallies from past cycles, where XRP surged 2,117% in 2013, 110,466% in 2017, and 1,208% in 2020. Building on this trend, XRP has recently broken through a long-term resistance level, mirroring the early stages of its previous explosive bull cycles. If historical patterns repeat, the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of another explosive bull run this cycle.

Title: Is it time to end Major League Baseball’s antitrust exemption?
URL: https://www.deseret.com/politics/2025/11/07/major-league-baseball-antitrust-exemption-mike-lee-urge-court-overturn/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T19:34:17Z
Full Content:
Two U.S. senators, including one from Utah, are taking another swing at ending Major League Baseball’s century-old exemption from antitrust laws. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn a longstanding precedent that has shielded professional baseball from the nation’s antitrust laws. Lee in a statement said baseball for too long has enjoyed an exemption from the competition laws that apply to every other professional sport and business in the country. “As I’ve said before, baseball understands best of all the benefits of competition,” said Lee, chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights. “Sadly, our Supreme Court has historically balked at the opportunity to overturn a wrongly decided case, and subject professional baseball to the same competition laws as every other professional sport. It is time for America’s pastime to be revitalized by the laws governing all American businesses.” Lee introduced legislation in 2023 to end the exemption. Booker, the subcommittee ranking member, said baseball has enjoyed a “free pass” to break the rules of fair competition because of a flawed Supreme Court ruling, one that the court itself has acknowledged was a mistake. “The one-of-a-kind antitrust exemption gives leagues the power to artificially control salaries, ticket prices, team relocations, and more, harming players and baseball fans alike,” he said in a statement. In 1922, the Supreme Court ruled in Federal Baseball Club v. National League that the Sherman Antitrust Act does not apply to professional baseball, specifically to “[t]he business [of] giving exhibitions of base ball [sic].” In that case, the Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, a team and member of the Federal League, sued the National League and the American League, claiming they had conspired to monopolize the business of professional baseball by buying out members of the Federal League and by inducing its members to leave. The court decided that pro baseball games were not interstate commerce and were therefore outside the scope of the antitrust act because they were exhibitions, rather than a business affecting trade or commerce among the states. The senators’ brief comes in the case of Cangrejeros de Santurce Baseball Club, LLC v. Liga de Beisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico, Inc. They argue in the filing that modern professional baseball bears no resemblance to the localized exhibitions in 1922 and is a multibillion-dollar interstate enterprise indistinguishable from other professional sports. The case involves a dispute between the former owner of a professional baseball franchise in Puerto Rico and the league, its president and other franchise owners. The owner, Thomas Axon, a financial professional from New York, alleges that the league conspired to force him to relinquish control of the team, violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and other laws. Axon claims that the league’s actions were in retaliation for his criticism of the conditions at the team’s publicly-owned stadium and his threat to move the team to another city. The case has worked its way through various courts over the past three years. Attorneys for Axon petitioned the Supreme Court in October to take up the case. “The baseball antitrust exemption is no longer sustainable (if ever it was), and it should be overruled. The exemption’s conceptual foundation — that the business of baseball is not interstate commerce and thus not subject to federal economic regulation at all — was questionable from the start and is today wholly indefensible," according to the petition. The Supreme Court addressed the baseball exemption twice before. In 1953, it upheld the exemption. In 1972, it continued the exemption based on precedent set by prior cases and saying Congress must correct any errors in previous decisions by amending the antitrust laws. Lee and Booker argue in the brief that Congress should not be required to fix a “mistaken interpretation” of the law — when the court can and should overrule the Federal Baseball decision now. Congress has considered bills in the past to do away with baseball’s exemption, with the late Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch among those leading the charge in the 1990s. In 1998, it passed the Curt Flood Act partially repealing the exemption, allowing major league players to sue MLB for employment-related matters, such as compensation and working conditions. The law does not apply to minor league players, franchise relocation or other areas of baseball’s business. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has defended baseball in response to a Senate Judiciary Committee inquiry about the exemption in 2023. He argued that “it may not be possible” for the league to enforce, establish and maintain better working conditions for minor leaguer players if the exemption were lifted. “Without coordinated oversight and decision-making by MLB, it is likely that more Minor League affiliates will leave their existing communities for a superior player-development environment, and that fewer — rather than more — Minor League clubs affiliated with MLB clubs will exist in the future,” he wrote. As ESPN reported, Manfred argued that the league must maintain the current player development system because it already spends $1 billion annually to support the minor leagues, which do not make a profit and are subsidized by MLB teams. That allows teams to provide low ticket prices and remain in areas that otherwise could not “economically support a professional baseball team.”

Nvidia stock down today as the AI giant faces its sharpest crash of 2025. Shares of $NVDA plunged over 16% since Monday, wiping out nearly $800 billion in market value in four days. The stock closed at $181.62, down 3.43%, with heavy trading volume above 143 million shares. Investors are pulling back after months of record gains, spooked by U.S.–China export curbs, AI chip delays, and stretched valuations. Nvidia’s $5 trillion dream now feels fragile as the AI boom shows first cracks in Wall Street’s most-watched stock.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 10:10:17 AM PST by SeekAndFind Technology firms led private-sector job cuts as employers looked to cut costs and address AI. Last month was the worst October for layoff announcements since 2003 as companies slashed roles to save money, pared back pandemic-era hires, and planned ahead for artificial intelligence, according to the global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers announced 153,074 cuts last month, compared to 55,597 cuts in October 2024. Last month’s figure was “the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a report Thursday. Altogether, US firms announced the end of 1,099,500 positions through the first 10 months of this year, up 44% from the 761,358 cuts seen for the entirety of 2024. Technology businesses led private-sector layoffs. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Challenger said in a statement. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he continued. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Recent notable layoff announcements have come from Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), and UPS (UPS). Year-to-date cuts are at their highest since 2020, Challenger said, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the labor market. The Challenger report comes amid a data drought from the Labor Department due to the government shutdown — now the longest in US history. The last official jobs report reflects labor conditions from August, while data from September has yet to be published. October’s jobs report, due out tomorrow, is unlikely to be published.

The Federal Reserve officially sets its benchmark for an optimum percentage of full employment at an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. Full employment is defined as the optimal range of unemployment where there a balance between the number of Americans gainfully employed and those seeking new job positions to avoid the negative economic consequences of labor shortages. Economists typically use 4-6% unemployment as an optimum number in our economy. If unemployment numbers go above an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are out of work but if unemployment numbers go below an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are working and there are the potential for serious labor shortages At unemployment levels below 5.0% people who are looking for jobs are in high demand and can find a new and often better job quickly and with little difficulty. As of now, at an official 4.35 % unemployment we are well below the 5.0 % unemployment levels that the Federal Reserves considers the optimum for a healthy, dynamic economy that balances job mobility, full employment and an adequate pool of skilled workers so that employers can readily hire the kind of labor force they need without shortages. In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. 15 posted on 11/07/2025 10:49:19 AM PST by rdcbn1 (..when poets buy guns, tourist season is over................Walter R.

Altogether, US firms announced the end of 1,099,500 positions through the first 10 months of this year, up 44% from the 761,358 cuts seen for the entirety of 2024. Technology businesses led private-sector layoffs. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Challenger said in a statement. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he continued. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Recent notable layoff announcements have come from Amazon (AMZN), Target (TGT), and UPS (UPS). Year-to-date cuts are at their highest since 2020, Challenger said, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the labor market. The Challenger report comes amid a data drought from the Labor Department due to the government shutdown — now the longest in US history. The last official jobs report reflects labor conditions from August, while data from September has yet to be published. October’s jobs report, due out tomorrow, is unlikely to be published.

The Federal Reserve officially sets its benchmark for an optimum percentage of full employment at an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. Full employment is defined as the optimal range of unemployment where there a balance between the number of Americans gainfully employed and those seeking new job positions to avoid the negative economic consequences of labor shortages. Economists typically use 4-6% unemployment as an optimum number in our economy. If unemployment numbers go above an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are out of work but if unemployment numbers go below an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are working and there are the potential for serious labor shortages At unemployment levels below 5.0% people who are looking for jobs are in high demand and can find a new and often better job quickly and with little difficulty. As of now, at an official 4.35 % unemployment we are well below the 5.0 % unemployment levels that the Federal Reserves considers the optimum for a healthy, dynamic economy that balances job mobility, full employment and an adequate pool of skilled workers so that employers can readily hire the kind of labor force they need without shortages. In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. 15 posted on 11/07/2025 10:49:19 AM PST by rdcbn1 (..when poets buy guns, tourist season is over................Walter R.

I won’t argue that’s scary for the younger generation - and it should be! - but the reality is that a token-cost spend is maybe 10% of an FTE. I still need that work done - but nobody is going to spend 10X the cost to do it.

The Federal Reserve officially sets its benchmark for an optimum percentage of full employment at an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. Full employment is defined as the optimal range of unemployment where there a balance between the number of Americans gainfully employed and those seeking new job positions to avoid the negative economic consequences of labor shortages. Economists typically use 4-6% unemployment as an optimum number in our economy. If unemployment numbers go above an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are out of work but if unemployment numbers go below an unemployment rate of 5. 0 to 5. 2%. then too many people are working and there are the potential for serious labor shortages At unemployment levels below 5.0% people who are looking for jobs are in high demand and can find a new and often better job quickly and with little difficulty. As of now, at an official 4.35 % unemployment we are well below the 5.0 % unemployment levels that the Federal Reserves considers the optimum for a healthy, dynamic economy that balances job mobility, full employment and an adequate pool of skilled workers so that employers can readily hire the kind of labor force they need without shortages. In fact, we are very close to the danger zone of too low of an unemployment rate for optimum economic growth. 15 posted on 11/07/2025 10:49:19 AM PST by rdcbn1 (..when poets buy guns, tourist season is over................Walter R.

Too many people hear “AI” and they lean on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation - basically, turning it look on the wild universe) and think it’s all about asking silly gotcha questions. The reality is: Within my limited stack, with lighter-RAG touches? I can - and we are - using agentic AI in closed boxes to replace a lot of entry-level work. I won’t argue that’s scary for the younger generation - and it should be! - but the reality is that a token-cost spend is maybe 10% of an FTE. I still need that work done - but nobody is going to spend 10X the cost to do it. My advice would be that it’s no different than any other technical advancement - and that’s been a fact of life forever. Automation, computers, networks, you name it. Make yourself valuable. Complain to the wind, or learn to adapt and figure out the value proposition. If Ai can make it cheaper to run a business by needing less employees I hope this leads to smaller businesses being able to compete.

Title: BioWare are "focused exclusively" on the next Mass Effect, says exec producer, along with a Krogan teaser
URL: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-focused-exclusively-on-the-next-mass-effect-says-exec-producer-along-with-a-krogan-teaser
Time Published: 2025-11-07T18:02:38Z
Full Content:
"We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build..." Even as the consortium led by Donald Trump's haunted finger puppet Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund proceed with their wildly leveraged $50 billion acquisition of Electronic Arts, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble would like everybody to know that we're just fine, you guys. Everything is hunkey-dorey over here at BioWare, a studio whose last few, famously difficult original videogame projects both severely undershot commercial expectations, as we gaze down the barrel of a buyout that will leave our parent organisation $20 billion in debt and beholden to new owners who may disagree with everything we stand for, and who allegedly want to juice the screws with generative AI. Happy N7 Day, you bastards. Here's a cute coded message for you about the future of Mass Effect, 13 years since the last indisputably good one (sorry Nic). Please ignore the tears streaming down my face. OK, so this characterisation is both mean-spirited and quite silly, but I cannot read Gamble's smiling words without hearing somebody cocking a Kessler out of shot. "Like you, we've heard the rumors lately," he acknowledges, after some seasonal preamble. "You've made it clear you care deeply about what's next. So let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe." For context, the next Mass Effect game was sort-of-announced in 2020. Since then, there has been the occasional snippet of info about the possible return of the Geth and the definite return of senior developers from the original trilogy, but nothing of real substance, for BioWare's attention has been firmly fixed on the completion of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The latter missed EA's opening quarterly targets, prompting mass layoffs in a year when EA staff earned less on average while CEO Andrew Wilson got himself a pay rise. All this was before the proposed $50 billion dollar acquisition, which has led one former Dragon Age executive to speculate that EA might sell BioWare or close them down. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble went on. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show." He also gave an update on the forthcoming Mass Effect TV show, on which BioWare are collaborating with Amazon. Amazon, the revolting business empire that turned Sauron into an office creep, though I will concede they did an OK job with Fallout. "The writers room is going strong, and we've got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game," Gamble added. "The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story - because after all ... that's YOUR story, isn't it?" It is, Mike, and I'll thank Jeff Bezos to keep his stinking space colonisation fantasies away from my precious Normandy. If you're wondering why the blog post text looks weird, that's because as with N7 Day bulletins of yore, it contains a hidden message. Tot up all the italicised words, including game names, and you get "u r l Mass Effect k r g a n", unless I've missed a few. Which I guess points towards a website of some kind, while teasing that the Krogan are in Mass Effect 5. I've jumbled the letters up several times and I can't find a way to make it read "please Sony buy us".

US stock market plunged Friday, fueling fears that the AI bubble is bursting before it matures. The Nasdaq fell 1.9%, the S&P 500 lost 1.1%, and the Dow slipped 0.7% as investors dumped major tech names. Nvidia crashed over 4%, breaking below its 50-day line after the US blocked AI chip sales to China, while Palantir slid 1.2% on heavy volume. Consumer sentiment dropped to 50.3, inflation expectations rose to 4.7%, and analysts warned a deeper market correction could follow if the AI-led rally keeps unraveling.

Title: Billionaire Bill Ackman Clowned For Mamdani Appeal After Mayoral Win
URL: https://hiphopwired.com/2898673/bill-ackman-clowned-for-mamdani-appeal-after-mayoral-win/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T17:27:39Z
Full Content:
Billionaire Bill Ackman is being laughed at for his humble words towards Zohran Mamdani after his NYC mayoral win. A billionaire behind some of the biggest attacks on New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is being raked over the coals for being highly conciliatory to him after his decisive win. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman congratulated Mamdani. “Congrats on the win,” he wrote, adding: Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.” The tweet was a surprising pivot from his previous words about the Queens assemblyman during his campaign. Ackman, who is a noted supporter of President Donald Trump, had been backing independent candidate and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the race and was one of Mamdani’s most vicious critics, hammering him with false claims of him being antisemitic and “amplifying hate” against Jewish New Yorkers. Mamdani has been a firm critic of Israel’s policies, particularly in their conflict in Gaza. Those attacks were often seen in multi-paragraph posts on X, where he also tore down Mamdani’s campaign positions of making New York City more affordable for residents (which include increasing taxes on corporations and billionaires, free bus service, city-run grocery stores and rent freezes for stabilized apartments), claiming it would make the city “much more dangerous and economically unviable,” and spur an exodus of billionaires. Ackman went so far as to donate $1.75 million to two super PACs – Defend NYC and the pro-Cuomo group Fix The City. But now, his conciliatory words have been accepted by the 34-year-old mayor-elect. “I appreciated his words,” Mamdani said while appearing on Good Morning America on Wednesday (Nov. 5). “I think what I find is that there is a needed commitment from leaders of the city to speak and work with anyone who is committed to lowering the cost of living in the city—and that’s something that I will fulfill.” Ackman would be the first of a group of other wealthy figures making overtures to Mamdani. Blackrock co-founder Ralph Schlosstein also publicly pledged support. “I do care deeply about the city, and I’m not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I’m going to do whatever I can to help him be successful,” he remarked, according to Forbes magazine. Mamdani is keeping his grassroots structured, as he begins the work of assuming office next January, announcing an all-woman transition team headed by former Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan.

Title: 'Big Short' Michael Burry's $1bn market crash bet pays off as stocks suffer worst day since Trump's tariff meltdown

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 9:24:26 AM PST by DFG The man who predicted the 2008 financial crash could soon be proven right again. On Tuesday, Michael Burry — who became a household name after predicting the 2008 crash and inspiring the film The Big Short — had wagered more than $1 billion that Wall Street's AI boom will end in tears. Now the cracks are showing. US tech stocks are on track for their worst week since Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs rattled global markets in April. Eight of the most valuable AI-driven companies — among them Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle — have lost a staggering $1.1 trillion in market value since the end of last week. By midday in New York, The S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent, the Nasdaq 2 percent and the Dow 300 points, or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq is on course for a 4 percent weekly loss, its sharpest decline since Trump's tariff war years. Burry specifically bet that the value of stock for Nvidia and Palantir — two of the market’s hottest AI plays — would fall, and those two have been hardest hit. Shares of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — tumbled another 4 percent Friday, leaving them down 13 percent for the week. Palantir has plunged 17 percent since Monday, Filings show Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options worth about $900 million against Palantir and $187 million against Nvidia. A put option is a financial bet that pays off if a company's share price falls. CEO Jensen Huang made things worse by admitting that 'China is going to win the AI race.' He later tried to walk back the remark, but investors were already spooked. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

Title: Elon Musk says 'TeraFab' chip fab may be the only answer to Tesla's colossal AI semiconductor demand — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warns against 'extremely hard' challenge

A new approach to chipmaking? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Elon Musk is thinking about outsourcing some of Tesla’s chip production to Intel Foundry and even establishing the company’s own chip production operation, he said at the company’s Annual Shareholder Meeting event. Musk is perhaps the first executive of a big company to consider building an entire semiconductor production facility due to the extreme complexities and costs associated with such a project. Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, already reacted to Musk’s musings, noting that the head of Tesla may be underestimating the challenge. “I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab,” Musk said. “It is like [TSMC’s] Giga[fab] but way bigger.” TSMC calls its fab complexes with production capacity from 30,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month ‘Megafabs’, whereas fab complexes with production capacities of over 100,000 WSPM are referred to as ‘Gigafabs.’ A ‘Terafab’ would mean capacity way beyond 100,000 WSPM, which would transform Tesla into one of the industry’s biggest chipmakers. To put the capacity into context: TSMC’s Fab 21 complex in Arizona — which will cost the foundry $165 billion in total — is expected to become a Gigafab with six fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center. Apparently, Musk is eyeing something bigger. But let us decode the whole story first, as it takes more than money to become a chipmaker these days. “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard,” Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, said at a TSMC event on Thursday. “It is not just build the plant, but the engineering, the science, and the artistry of doing what TSMC does for a living is extremely hard.” 3/5 Jensen on Elon Musk’s chip fab plan: “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard. It’s not just build the plant, but the engineering, the science and the artistry of doing what TSMC does for a living is extremely hard. $NVDA $TSLA $TSMNovember 7, 2025 As a major carmaker that also owns some of the industry's largest AI supercomputers, Tesla needs a steady supply of high-performance processors to power its artificial intelligence efforts. The company already uses tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, and now that its Dojo project has been cancelled, it plans to use its AI5 processors for cars and robots in its data centers as well. To get plenty of these processors, Tesla plans to double-source them from TSMC and Samsung. Musk also mentioned tapping Intel for chip production, though this might be a bit challenging as the company does not have any automotive-grade process technologies. “One of the things I am trying to figure out is how do we make enough chips,” Musk asked rhetorically during his keynote speech at the Tesla event. “So, I have a lot of respect for the Tesla partners, TSMC and Samsung, you know, maybe we will do something with Intel. We have not signed any deal, but it is probably worth having discussions with Intel.” However, he believes that his company will need more AI processors in the long term, which will necessitate building its own chipmaking operations, essentially becoming an integrated device manufacturer (IDM), a role that even established chip designers like AMD, Fujitsu, IBM, and Panasonic gave up in recent decades. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. “Even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it is still not enough,” Musk told the audience. “So, I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab. It is like [TSMC’s] Giga[fab] but way bigger. I cannot see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we are looking for, so I think we are probably going to have to build a gigantic chip fab. It’s gotta be done.” It costs leading-edge chipmakers billions of dollars to develop a fabrication process and tens of billions to build a single fab with a 20,000 WSPM capacity capable of making chips on a state-of-the-art process technology. Rapidus — Japan’s first new chipmaker with plans to build chips on advanced nodes in decades — estimates that it needs around ¥5 trillion (about $32 billion) in total investment to develop a process technology and build a fab capable of commercial production of 2 nm-class chips in 2027. While we can only applaud this ambitious project, it remains to be seen whether becoming a leading chipmaker from scratch is possible in the 2020s and with leading-edge nodes. Developing a new process technology from scratch is a particularly complex, multidisciplinary endeavor that takes 5 or more years these days, from inception to yield ramp. A development cycle of a fabrication technology begins with pathfinding, materials research, transistor structure development, and then running countless TCAD simulations to model doping, strain, and leakage for a new transistor. Rapidus has licensed its 2nm GAA transistor structure from IBM, but it is also possible to license a chunk of similar technologies from imec and CEA-Leti, public-private R&D institutes. But while it is hard to overestimate the importance of the right transistor structure, this is only the start. Once transistor technology is complete, engineers build thousands of tightly coupled process steps organized into FEOL, MOL, and BEOL modules — covering transistor formation, interconnects, and metallization. Each of these steps demands atomic-level precision in deposition, etch, lithography, and anneal. Tuning those steps (each with hundreds, if not thousands, of parameters) for manufacturability, uniformity, reliability, defectivity, power, and performance requires decades of engineering experience and time from the team. At this point, technology providers like IBM, Imec, or CEA-Leti cannot really help. Once each deposition, etch, implant, lithography, and anneal step is stable in isolation, engineers start combining modules (e.g., transistor gate stack and source/drain) on test wafers and tune their sequencing and temperature budgets to prevent cross-contamination or material degradation. This is essentially when the ordered stack of hundreds of steps that define the node — the process flow — takes shape. Again, these integration recipes are not available for licensing from R&D companies or institutes. After device performance, power, and yield meet targets, the process must be made design-usable by generating PDKs, SPICE models, verified standard-cell libraries for EDA tools, and IPs for chip designers. At the same time, engineers begin implementing the fabrication process in actual fabs and production lines. That implementation and setting the right parameters for equipment is another challenge that demands experience, not something money can buy. Finally, fabs must achieve high yields in mass production, which is a hard, long, and iterative process involving plenty of experienced engineers.Can this all be done from scratch in a mere five years by a newcomer?

Title: Retail industry remains one of ‘hardest hit’ from 2025 job cuts

Let Retail Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The federal government again did not publish its monthly jobs report, but Challenger, Gray & Christmas data shows another period of high layoffs across sectors. October turned out to be a bleak month for some retail employees who, just ahead of the holidays, found out their roles are being eliminated. It was also a rough month overall, as it marked the highest job cut total in October in more than 20 years. Through the first 10 months of the year, U.S. employers have now cut more than 1 million jobs, according to Challenger, the highest total since 2020. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes.” In retail, October brought on major layoff announcements from some of the industry’s biggest players. Target announced it would cut 1,000 corporate staff and close 800 open roles — representing about 8% of its global headquarters workforce — as part of an effort to streamline its corporate structure. However, the impact is not immediate, with laid off employees receiving pay and benefits until Jan. 3. E-commerce giant Amazon also announced it would cut about 14,000 corporate roles and will offer most employees 90 days to find a new position internally, if they wish to. Additionally, Puma in October revealed it plans to eliminate about 900 more corporate jobs globally and Carter’s said it will lay off about 300 corporate employees by the end of the year. Some retailers are still focused on hiring for the busy holiday season though. For example, Dick’s Sporting Goods is aiming to hire 14,000 associates across its businesses, Amazon will again plan to hire 250,000 workers and Michael's is planning to bring on 10,000 seasonal workers.

Title: Friday Bullet Points More Video Game Endings

And not the good kind. It is Friday and there are some news items that have popped up that I want to notice, even if only in passing. The writing was on the wall for the unloved Tencent MMORPG. I am pretty sure the MMO news sites spent more time trying to cast some spurious unflattering narrative or another about the game than actually seeing it for what it was… another mediocre entry in a very tired niche market. Is that the sun setting over the clouds? Is this MMORPG Elysium? The crime wasn’t cloning or being a throw away title as one columnist kept suggesting. There was nothing intrinsically wrong with it, even if I did not love the control scheme. Rather, it was another failure to read the room, to see that the classic DikuMUD inspired, level grinding MMORPG is dead. Or, if not dead, then stale enough that the odor coming off of the genre suggests death. I haven’t really looked forward to a new fantasy MMORPG in over a decade. Maybe I am jaded… or maybe there has really been nothing new under the sun in the genre for a long, long time. I mean, I have a quote from GDC 2007 that called it almost 20 years ago: …because of WoW, and all the dumb money and all the publisher pressure, there’ll be lots of games that shouldn’t have been MMOs but would have been great boxed products. Lots of publishers are pushing for that subscription pie, but they’ll fail. -Rob Pardo, MMOs Past, Present, and Future Panel at GDC 2007 Some titles are great and thrive as a massive experience. But most don’t. We’ve seen it over and over and over and over again. It isn’t that nobody can beat WoW or that WoW destroyed the genre… it is that replaying the same tropes and mechanics over and over for a couple of decades gets old. Tarisland was a competent recycling of those tired tropes. It did all the things expected of it. In a vacuum where nobody had seen a fantasy MMORPG, it could have been a winner. But we live in the real world where we have seen this model too many times, and the market for that sort of thing isn’t limitless… and was never as big as some suggested. The WoW-killer of myth was never going to be a copy of WoW’s model. Speaking of fantasy MMORPGs and tropes and what not, the Greg Street (formerly Ghostcrawler at Blizzard) and his studio Fantastic Pixel Castle lost its financial support from NetEase and was unable to find any other backers. My tirade above about the staleness of the MMORPG market and the complete failure of anything new in that specific niche to grab an audience and make a strong name for itself in the last decade or so could feed into this. We don’t know what plans they had or if their vision might have broken new ground or just attempted to revisit the same old scenes. Maybe NetEase couldn’t be convinced that there was any “there” there in the studio’s plan. Or maybe investors are skittish about big projects in general. The layoffs do not seem to be slowing down in the video games industry. We just saw Amazon bail out on the idea of any sort of large scale, live service game last week when they found that even their money couldn’t make the genre something it was not. Anyway, the princess that will save us from this was clearly in another castle this time around. EA is out there trying to woo the SEC to allow its board of directors to cash out… because not one of them ever cared a whit about making video games.. by selling the company to the Saudis in a deal that is structured in such a way as to blow up whatever EA was so as to end up with a shell of the former structure. I’ve been over that before in a whole post bidding farewell to EA and whatever it was. Despite having paid off the president by allowing his son-in-law to “broker” the deal for a huge fee, they are going through the motions and pretending somebody might object or try to block the acquisition. But nobody will. The president has put the most grossly incompetent people in charge of every government department to ensure they are only loyal to him and will only do what he says because they are mentally unprepared to do anything else. So the acquisition theater goes on, which included the FAQ that EA sent out to employees with the following entry: That is such a lie that I assume that the lawyer who wrote it was wearing asbestos underwear in order to shield himself from the inevitability of his pants bursting into flames due to the flagrance of the lack of candor being displayed. I mean sure, that first point is technically true, depending on your definition of immediate. EA won’t be driving people into the street with clubs the very moment the deal closes. But the company will be saddled with so much debt that the only reason some people will be kept around is that they probably can’t sell an unstaffed studio to another company. It will be a bloodbath and I will be mightily surprised if the company employs 20% of its current staff a year after the merger is complete. It will, in common with all such mergers and acquisitions, lead to job losses, studio closures, price increases, service reductions, and a variety of other lesser bad outcomes for the consumers, all to make a few individuals incrementally more wealthy and to allow the Saudis to have Madden titles featured at their esports complex in an attempt to put a friendly face on their bloodthirsty dictatorship. When people complain about the problems with late stage capitalism, this is what they are talking about, a situation where billionaires are rewarded for eliminating jobs and screwing over the general public with the full support and assistance of the government they have bought and paid for. My final entry is pretty small potatoes relative to the above. Another EVE Online fan site appears to have fallen over and will likely not be revived. This is a story that will keep repeating itself I am sure. Such sites do not last forever and the game suffers from time to time because CCP leans so hard on the community to fill in the gaps it cannot, or will not, fill itself. The company couldn’t even maintain a wiki about the game after all. In this case it was a simple site that collected the RSS feeds from the now dwindling few bloggers who write about the game and presented them in a few different views as well as a consolidated RSS feed that I run on the side bar of my other blog. It looks like the inner workings of the site gave up the ghost on October 18, after which it collected no more entries. The site only maintained a seven day combined feed, so its unified output dried up a week later. The site was run by Steve Ronouken, or Fuzzy Steve, a long time EVE Online industrialist and a former CSM member. Judging from his blog he hasn’t been active on the site for a few years. Something changed in the background or got updated and things broke I guess. The funny thing is that a dozen years ago there was a fight over who would host the site and claim the name when Marc Scaurus decided to step down from running his iteration of the site. There was community drama and name calling as two sides struggled to claim the EVE Bloggers name. Now none of the sites I mentioned in that post are up and running… except for Foo’s EVE Blogroll. We still have that at least. The site was never a huge source of traffic here or at my other site, but it was often a quality source, bringing people in already keen on the game. So it goes. Addendum: Oh, and a Warhammer MMO was cancelled as well. Re: Fantastic Pixel Castle, Josh Strife Hayes had a video a couple of months ago about him being invited to the pre-alpha of their MMO and he was entirely whelmed. Obviously it was early days, but it didn’t really look like they had a strong, coherent vision for their product (yet). LikeLike Yeah, I could see that. As soon as you start framing it up as an MMORPG or something adjacent, you get roped into a lot of assumptions, and building something out in a pre-Alpha state that speaks to the vision is difficult. LikeLike I expect EA to simply pump out annual FIFA and Madden updates, utilizing AI for all of the data (and the QA/QC work), and get rid of everything else. Okay, maybe throw The Sims a bone and have a few addons there too, but I’d also see The Sims more “aligned” with Saudi “sensibilities”. Everything else? Pretty much gone. The thing is, boardgames saw this already with the Embracer Group fueled buyout of everything under Asmodee’s umbrella. It took about 5-10 years, but all that bloodletting inevitably let to the game developer diaspora creating vibrant new boardgames under independent companies. That’ll happen with video games, but it’ll take a while. LikeLiked by 1 person Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Share this article JPMorgan, a major US bank, disclosed holding 5.3 million shares of BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) valued at $343 million as of Sept. 30, representing a 64% increase since June, according to a new filing tracked by Macroscope. The bank’s expanded Bitcoin ETF position reflects the growing institutional adoption of crypto assets through regulated investment vehicles. Traditional financial institutions have increasingly embraced cryptocurrency exposure through ETFs as they offer familiar regulatory frameworks. JPMorgan’s SEC filing also discloses positions in Bitcoin ETF options, indicating the bank has developed strategic hedging or trading activities in the crypto sector beyond its direct ETF holdings.

Title: Warren Buffett-Inspired Strategy Drives Canadian Bitcoin Treasury Growth | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. What happens when long-term investment wisdom meets the fast-moving adoption of Bitcoin? A Canadian fintech is quietly blending patience, discipline, and digital assets, showing that a Buffett-inspired approach might find its footing in crypto. Mogo Inc., a Canadian fintech company, is demonstrating that Warren Buffett’s value investing principles can coexist with digital assets. In May 2024, the company adopted what it calls the Berkshire Hathaway playbook, integrating long-term, disciplined investing principles into its wealth platform. The move marked a deliberate pivot away from speculative trading. It emphasized patience, temperament, and behavioral discipline, core tenets of Buffett’s approach. Eighteen months later, that philosophy is showing tangible results in Mogo’s digital asset strategy, particularly Bitcoin. “Mogo reports continued platform growth and record assets under management in Q3 2025,” said Mogo Inc. President and co-founder Greg Feller. In Q3 2025, the company increased its Bitcoin holdings by over 300% quarter-over-quarter, bringing the total to $4.7 million. This follows a July 2025 move, where Mogo’s board approved a strategic initiative authorizing up to $50 million in Bitcoin allocations as a long-term reserve asset and capital benchmark. The Q3 allocations were funded through excess cash and monetization of other investments, all while maintaining operational liquidity. The board has formally designated Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset and capital benchmark. This signals a structured, treasury-focused approach to crypto holdings rather than short-term speculation. The initiative forms part of a broader evolution of Mogo’s Intelligent Investing platform, which integrates both self-directed and managed investing. The system utilizes behavioral science to reduce impulsive trading and encourage measured, long-term decisions. These principles align with the Berkshire Hathaway ethos. By pairing this disciplined framework with a growing crypto allocation, Mogo is bridging traditional value investing and modern digital assets in a way rarely seen in the fintech space. Mogo’s approach contrasts sharply with the typical retail crypto market, dominated by high-frequency trading and leveraged bets. By treating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the company is signaling that disciplined, long-term investment principles can survive, and even thrive, in crypto markets. The firm intends to continue building its Bitcoin treasury while expanding the behavioral investing features of its platform. “With the wind-down of our legacy trading business now behind us and continued execution of our Bitcoin treasury strategy, we’re entering 2026 with a stronger foundation and multiple tailwinds supporting our momentum,” read an excerpt in the press release, citing Feller. Its Q3 report makes clear that the fintech sees this as a structural shift, one that combines Buffett-inspired discipline with the opportunities of the digital asset economy. Investors fatigued by speculation can emulate the Canadian company’s approach, which showcases a rare model for measured and thoughtful participation in Bitcoin.

Title: AMC Networks Sheds 5% Of Global Workforce Via Voluntary Buyouts
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/11/amc-networks-workforce-voluntary-buyouts-1236610587/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:28:30Z

By Dade Hayes Business Editor AMC Networks, which is continuing to navigate the transition from linear TV to streaming, is shedding less than 5% of its global workforce of 1,800 employees via voluntary buyouts. CEO Kristin Dolan announced the reduction Friday during the company’s third-quarter earnings call with Wall Street analysts. The company had earlier reported mixed results for the quarter, with advertising sliding 17% but streaming revenue climbing 14%. In the company’s earnings release, Dolan called the quarterly performance “a key milestone in our transition from a cable networks business to a global streaming and technology focused content company.” Dolan said “less than 5%” of the workforce would be departing as a result of an initiative to “ensure we have the right skills for the future.” She added that company leaders are “thankful for the contributions of those who have chosen to pursue new opportunities, and of course those who are driving this new era of the company.” Watch on Deadline AMC Networks, parent of cable networks AMC, IFC, Sundance TV, We TV and BBC America, also operates a portfolio of niche streaming services AMC+, Shudder and Acorn TV, with a total of 10.4 million subscribers. The downsizing at AMC Networks comes during a much broader pullback across the entertainment sector. Paramount, in the wake of its merger with Skydance, is laying off about 2,000 workers, about 10% of its total head count. Warner Bros. Discovery recently initiated layoffs in its cable business, and is likely to be part of more cutbacks as it nears a transaction to either be acquired or split into two companies. Disney also let several hundred workers go last summer. It isn’t just traditional media tightening the belt, however. Advances in artificial intelligence are resulting in significant cuts even at Big Tech firms. Amazon last month said it was cutting 14,000 corporate employees, including in publishing and video game development. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Title: ‘Do I need it?’ Groceries cost 20% to 40% more than before the pandemic. How San Diegans are making do

Mike Portal uses a no-fee credit card that gives 6% back on groceries. He pays it off every month. The chicken drumsticks in Chris Lovelace’s freezer cost 99 cents a pound, far cheaper than the red meat he used to buy. Margi Thornburgh, a night owl, checks ads and clips coupons every Wednesday at midnight and hunts for more discounts on store shelves. “I really get a thrill out of getting a bargain,” she said after spotting $1.99 smoothies at Vons recently, down from $3.99. Because they were half off, she bought 12 instead of six. “I was skipping out of the store with a big smile on my face.” These are some of San Diego’s super shoppers, who have been training for this era of fast rising grocery prices for decades. Some have the resources to turn frugal shopping into a sport of sorts — a car that lets them buy in bulk, time to shop for deals, storage space, multiple grocery stores close to home. For others, strapped for space or time, the path to eating adequately while not overspending is more challenging. Grocery prices have risen for a mix of reasons, including pandemic-era supply chain blockages and import tariffs that are passed on to shoppers. In San Diego County, food eaten outside of restaurants cost 4.4% more this July than a year earlier. That is the latest figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose publications stopped due to the federal shutdown. Fresher data — St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s nationwide FRED figures for September — show milk prices were up 10 cents a gallon over last year and up 68 cents over five years earlier, a rise of almost 20%. White bread was down 11 cents from last year but up 38 cents from five years earlier, about 25% higher. Ground beef cost $6.32 a pound, up from $5.67 a year ago and $4.08 in 2020. In the San Diego metro area, meat was 41% higher last month than in October 2019, dairy was 27% higher and produce was 18% higher, according to a grocery price index by Datasembly, a market analytics company that tracks prices of 1,000 products weekly across the United States. Local prices of meat and non-alcoholic beverages kept rising in the past six months, produce is almost even, and dairy and bakery items have fallen slightly, Datasembly found. Faced with these higher prices, San Diegans have changed how they plan and eat. They are abandoning foods and replacing stores they shopped at for decades with ones that have sales and coupons. They’re clinging to a few favorite items — Diet Coke, Diet Snapple, eggs and bourbon were mentioned. But they’re giving up a degree of control, opting to eat what’s on sale and not what they’re craving. They’re doing the math: if I spend this much on gas to drive around or spring for a freezer, but I save that much on food, is it worth it? As a teenager, Thornburgh learned to write grocery lists and shop weekly sales. Some 50 years later, she still uses those methods. But as local food prices have risen, outpacing the national inflation rate, Thornburgh has taken things further, combining every strategy she can think of so she doesn’t spend more than she must. “I look at all the ads either through the emails I receive or directly on the apps. I make my list by store of which items that I want to purchase. … I’m able to shop at multiple stores in one trip. I always bring a cooler to store cold and frozen items,” she outlined in an email to The San Diego Union-Tribune. Strolling through aisles, she keeps looking for deals. “I can be in a store, see an item on the shelf, and I will pull up the Target app, the Walmart app, the Food 4 Less app,” she said. “Any app of the store that I’m not in. And I will look for the price … and I will say, ‘Am I going to buy this here or am I going to go to another store?’” Her weekly grocery loop is time intensive, taking 90 minutes to two hours and covering as much as seven miles. Stops include Walmart, Food 4 less, Trader Joe’s and Vons. She recently folded in Aldi, drawn by an ad for 55-cent avocados. She picked those up, plus raspberries and asparagus, all on sale. Thornburgh, 70, gets income from contract sewing and Social Security. She is not among the 53% of adults who, according to a poll by AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, see grocery expenses as a “major source of stress.” (Groceries beat housing and health care costs and having inadequate savings or income as the top financial worry.) “I feel that I’m skilled enough and take advantage of all the tools out there,” she said. “I don’t feel stressed. But I’m very conscientious.” She reminds her husband: “If it’s not on sale, I’m not buying it. So he was really happy this week when Ding Dongs were on sale.” With these efforts, she spends around $100 a week, up from $60 before the pandemic, and saves around 50% on average at Vons and 40% at Food 4 Less. “With the money I save, it’s worth the investment of time,” she said. Thornburgh offered one more hint: don’t just shop online. Go inside stores. She acknowledged that shopping online and picking up groceries is convenient for some people, including parents of young children, but “you will miss the in-store sales, and sometimes those are substantial.” Jeff Lonsdale, Ken Sobel and Chris Lovelace are cutting back on red meat. “I don’t buy steaks anymore,” said Lonsdale, 68, who lives in a mobile retirement community in Oceanside. A half-package of sirloin burgers from Costco has been sitting in his freezer because he has “better, more affordable choices” today. He used to buy what he wanted, but as his income as a contract circuit designer fell and food prices hit new highs — especially for the beef burgers, steaks and pork chops he once enjoyed — he has changed his habits. “It used to be: I want it, I’ll go get it. Now I think, do I need it? Then maybe I go get it,” he said. “I don’t need doughnuts and cakes and desserts and that kind of thing, so I don’t even bother.” Currently, he said, “my income is short of expenses each month. My savings account keeps me above water.” Worried about cash flow, Lonsdale started tracking all food spending this year — both at stores and the occasional trip to Taco Bell. All together, his monthly spending on food is around $65 this year, he said. A food rescue program he visits three times a week helps him hold down costs, bringing surplus items from local grocery stores to his community. Around 40 people visit each time, he estimated. One recent morning, he picked up seafood salad with crackers, a 12-ounce watermelon cup, two mesquite-seasoned pork chops that totaled 12 ounces, an Earthbound Farms brand veggie tray with ranch dip, baby carrots, broccoli and celery, a Nathan’s hot dog and a 6-ounce Caesar salad. Based on the price tags he saw, he said the total might be around $20. “I mean, would you spend $3.99 for a little tray of cut up watermelon?” he said. “I get it for free and I’m loving it. And it’s not just the volume. It’s the variety. Things I have never thought about trying, never knew they had, wouldn’t have looked for.” Another nice surprise: goat cheese with herbs. “Wow, I’ll try that. It’s free. It was good.” Sobel, 71, who lives in La Jolla, cut out most meat and some other high-cost grocery items. “Sticker shock was a huge part of it — the prices that went higher all the time and the quality going down, almost commensurately,” he said. “That brought my focus back into buying only healthy foods, buying only what I’m going to eat, being careful about our choices.” After a hospitalization, Sobel decided to lose weight. He changed his diet in June and stopped buying “a lot of the high-price, mass-produced snack foods … that have skyrocketed in price.” One more change: “I really don’t throw away food anymore.” He makes a chef salad using turkey breast or sliced ham and eats that several days in a row, “until it’s completely gone.” “I’m lucky enough to be able to cut about 40% from my food budget and afford to eat,” added Sobel, who reduced his household’s average monthly grocery bill from around $550 (not counting the occasional restaurant delivery) before June to around $400 now. “But what about kids and seniors and low-income families who are losing their SNAP benefits?” Almost 400,000 San Diego County residents saw their CalFresh benefits — the state’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — halted Nov. 1 amid a federal government shutdown, now in its sixth week. Federal judges later ordered that funds be restarted. Between workers whose pay was frozen by the federal shutdown and people whose food benefits were postponed or trimmed, demand is surging at food banks and food-rescue nonprofits, whether in small communities like Lonsdale’s or at large distribution centers. In Encinitas, Lovelace rarely buys red meat at the store anymore. Instead, he goes out for quality burgers. “It’s got really, really good meat,” he said of Versailles Cafe’s $18 cheeseburger and fries. “It’s a real half pound, not a seven ouncer.” Lovelace’s rooftop solar on the house he and his wife, Dana, bought almost 50 years ago powers the two chest freezers he keeps in his garage. “I still don’t have any chicken breast in my freezer that I paid over $2 a pound for,” he said. Bacon was purchased at $4 a pound — around half of what it costs now full price. He is still working through the dozen packages of breakfast sausage he bought at half-off a while back. When he shops, he buys enough meat to last until the next big sale. Lovelace, who is 75 and retired, stopped shopping at stores that don’t send weekly ads. Like Thornburgh, he lives in a grocery-dense neighborhood with “all the big chains, so it’s really easy to get to places.” He focuses on house brands over pricier, name-brand versions. In-season food is also cheaper, he added. And he knows the market. “You have to know your prices. Sometimes that good deal really isn’t,” he said. These efforts are keeping the couple’s grocery costs almost even with last year: $560 a month in 2023 and 2024 and $577 this year, on average. “Doubtless expenses will begin to rise this holiday season as we liquidate our older inventories but we’ll still be kicking butt on money spent for food compared to any of my friends or neighbors when we compare notes on this topic,” Lovelace wrote in an email. He also credited his wife, who embraces his “cheapo philosophy.” In Mt. Helix, Portal is back to shopping like he did when he was a newlywed in the early 1990s — only now he has that cash-back credit card. “I was in the beginning of my career,” he said of his frugal youth. “We chose to have my wife stay home and take care of the babies. So, yeah, we pinched pennies and cut corners to save money.” Now his kids have kids and Portal, 65, has a home on Mt. Helix and a mortgage consulting business. But with the “tremendous increase in food costs” he has observed this year, he buys food on sale and stopped shopping at Whole Foods. “It’s just too high.” His small freezer holds berries bought on sale, which his toddler grandchildren devour. He also buys discounted meat and uses a vacuum sealer to avoid freezer burn. Ribeye on sale rose from $6 a pound to $9 or more, but even that is a relative bargain compared to full price, he said. Uncooked beef steaks cost on average $10.88 a pound last September and $12.26 this September, up from $8.13 five years ago, according to St. Louis Fed FRED data. To keep grocery expenses roughly the same as last year, even while springing for steak — and the chicken he cooks for RiRi, his 13-year-old Labrador pitbull mix — Portal and his wife stock up ahead of big holidays, when sales are “the best.” He gushed about his credit card, an American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card. Never carrying a balance is key, he said. Portal pointed value hunters to GTM Discount General Store, a surplus seller whose weekly sale recently featured 50% off Eddie Bauer sweatshirts, 40% off flood lightbulbs and 40% off spring wreaths. It has great deals on food, Portal added. Lovelace said he’s lucky to have two freezers and the garage shelves he built himself. “We have places to put stuff, and some people don’t. A lot of the things we do don’t apply across the board.” But his approach of stocking up when prices drop has worked across his lifetime. “In any given era, the same rule applies: prices on food have not gone down realistically over any real period of time in my lifetime. Little dips down and big jumps up,” he said.

Title: October Layoffs Were the Worst Since 2003 and Hit Tech Workers Hard

Reading time 2 minutes A lot of people can feel that the economy isn’t doing so hot right now. Unfortunately, due to the government shutdown, we don’t have much in the way of official economic data to give statistical clarity to that feeling. However, more and more, private firms are releasing their economic analysis, and, much of the time, it doesn’t bode well for the American worker. Now, a new report shows that this October was a particularly brutal month for the U.S. workforceâand it was especially bad for the tech industry. The analysis, from career transition services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, shows that this past month was the worst in decades. The report states that U.S. employers announced some “153,074 job cuts in October, up 175% from the 55,597 cuts announced in October 2024. It is up 183% from the 54,064 job cuts announced one month prior.” Yikes, that’s a lot. And the cuts have been especially deep for Silicon Valley: Technology continues to lead in private-sector job cuts as companies restructure amid AI integration, slower demand, and efficiency pressures. In October, the sector announced 33,281 job cuts, up sharply from 5,639 in September. For the year, Technology firms have announced 141,159 job cuts, up 17% from the 120,470 announced through the same period in 2024. Yeah, that’s bad. That is not good at all. There’s no real way to spin that as good. âThis is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008,” the report states. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape.” âOctoberâs pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month. Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.â We’ve already written about the huge layoffs that impacted the tech industry last monthâincluding some 14,000 people who used to be (but are no longer) employed with Amazon. The exact reason for why tech companies are shedding jobs right now is still up in the air. One narrative attributes the layoffs to the rise of AI, but other commentators have noted that it could be much more mundane economic/business factors that are squeezing the industry like a lack of growth in non-AI sectors and tariff policy eating away at profits while making it difficult to plan for the future.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 6:09:57 AM PST by yesthatjallen The share of first-time home buyers dropped to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers climbed to an all-time high of 40 years, according to the National Association of REALTORS®' 2025 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers. This annual survey of recent home buyers and sellers covers transactions between July 2024 and June 2025 and offers industry professionals, consumers, and policymakers detailed insights into homebuying and selling behavior. "The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory," said Jessica Lautz NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research. "The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007 – right before the Great Recession. The implications for the housing market are staggering. Today's first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result." "Unfolding in the housing market is a tale of two cities," Lautz explained. "We're seeing buyers with significant housing equity making larger down payments and all-cash offers, while first-time buyers continue to struggle to enter the market." "For generations, access to homeownership has been the primary way Americans build wealth and the cornerstone of the American Dream," said Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer. "Delayed or denied homeownership until age 40 instead of 30 can mean losing roughly $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home. FHA and VA programs have helped millions of Americans access homeownership, join the middle class, and create intergenerational wealth – a testament to smart government policy in support of homeownership."

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: OKSooner This is a socialist, anti-capitalist red herring. We’re talking less than 0.5% by *all such* firms. The rate of “investor-owned” properties was higher 40 years ago, before the 1986 tax bill changed mortgage interest deductibility, limiting it to primary homes. This data over the long haul is a function of two things: 1) Plummeting marriage rates. Easier to afford a home on two incomes than one. 2) Unwillingness of buyers to look outside of their “preferred” areas. Both are a function of individual choice - particularly the latter. If first-time homebuyers *insist* their first home has to be a townhome in Brooklyn, condo in Miami, or SFH in bazillion dollar California? I can’t help you. There are great deals to be had all over in places like Ohio and the plains - and I guarantee folks, there are jobs in Omaha, Kansas City, etc to be had with affordable first homes nearby. Hey, I believe in personal choice and freedom - so absolutely, if you insist on living in a HCOL area? You’re going to pay HCOL prices and they’re likely beyond the means of a first-time homebuyer. That’s your choice. It’s nobody’s job to “fix” that - certainly not the government’s job. I do agree that those HCOL areas could lower costs by cutting regulations/zoning/barriers to building, so I suppose THAT would be the (local) government’s job to do less... but ultimately, people have a choice: Either pay the premium or consider areas where you don’t have to pay a premium. 17 posted on 11/07/2025 6:55:15 AM PST by Capn Hayek (Capital is not responsible for Labor's lack of planning) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: yesthatjallen Get that age back down OR younger people are going to go for socialism instead of MAGA and the birthrate will remain very low. This is a critical issue.Right now MAGA has a chance to do something about it. I'd force Blackrock and the banks out of owning residential real estate, I'd ban non resident aliens from owning residential real estate and loosening any environmental regulations that hinder home building would be good steps. State and local governments need to ease strict zoning restrictions. Also, getting more younger Americans in good paying jobs by slashing H1Bs, imposing tariffs on foreign goods and deporting all the illegal aliens are positive steps. 18 posted on 11/07/2025 6:56:45 AM PST by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: yesthatjallen Cantillon Effects. 19 posted on 11/07/2025 6:58:31 AM PST by PGR88 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble California’s prices are insane.

Thank you Sierra Club and Democrat Party. Lower the price of land and construction. Change zoning and eliminate stupid enviro rules and a ton of land goes in the market. Lower regs on products that go into a house, most notably lumber harvest restrictions to increase supply and lower cost. Eliminate all the racist stuff that banks have to comply with to make sure they are not “discriminating “ against unfit borrowers who happen to be black which will lower the costs of loans (and lessen defaults). Remove regs that require fake “green” HvAC ( like no freon) and raise cost of appliances. The Buck Stops Here. Trump is going to get the blame, though he doesn’t deserve it. yeah, I bought my first house when I was 26 and now that house is worth over 300k. Importing a gadzillion legal immigrants didn’t help, either, don’t see how they can afford it. I blame the education system. If I had known what I know NOW, I’d have 4 homes and be much better off than I am now. And right now I’m pretty well off with my two homes. What about Blackrock buying up residential properties and selling them back to itself, inflating the price of new homes? These equity firms do unfortunately affect the housing market. Their being in the market as they are , helps constrict the supply of houses available for people who want to buy a house to live in the house. So based on supply and demand, that will force the rest of us to have to pay more for a house. I know I have oversimplified it here, but this is definitely part of what’s happening in the housing market. It doesn’t matter. The average idiot will still blame it all on Trump. When you let 100M people into your country over a period of just 50 years, it’s little surprise that there’s a “housing shortage”. The US is a small fraction of the overall world population. If we simply let 7B people come here at will, there will ALWAYS be a “housing shortage”. Ending mass immigration is one way to reserve space for American kids, not India or China or Africa or South America’s people. And please don’t spam me with the “whole world can live in Texas” meme. It’s juvenile and merely spatial, you couldn’t actually do anything like that and we don’t want to live in Calcutta anyway. Such is what happens when governments reduce interest rates over the last 15 years and house prices skyrocket. Additionally, when governments promote off-shoring of manufacturing to foreign countries over the last 35 years, good paying jobs are gone. So I am not surprised that the average first-home-buyer age is now 40 years. “””yeah, I bought my first house when I was 26 and now that house is worth over 300k.””” Likewise for me, I bought first house at age 26 for $44,000 and according to Zillow is now worth more than $2 million. My husband and I - two humble teachers - we able to afford a nice home in California in the early 90s. That same home is now worth $1.5 million in today’s market. We’d be able to afford nothing now. My son works in tech with a salary over $150k, his wife in real estate management does OK too. Homes in this state are unaffordable for them. “””If we simply let 7B people come here at will, there will ALWAYS be a “housing shortage”.””” Mass immigration hits two ways. 1. Creates a housing shortage so prices go up. 2. Reduces the wages of American Citizens. First time homeowners cannot get past the 6 1/2 to 7% interest rate. They were so spoiled by their parents buying homes at 2 1/2 to 3%. That’s what they think they should get. Older homeowners understand that this is still good compared to the rates in 2000 for example which were about 9%. And in the late 70s when they were 15%. This is a socialist, anti-capitalist red herring. We’re talking less than 0.5% by *all such* firms. The rate of “investor-owned” properties was higher 40 years ago, before the 1986 tax bill changed mortgage interest deductibility, limiting it to primary homes. This data over the long haul is a function of two things: 1) Plummeting marriage rates. Easier to afford a home on two incomes than one. 2) Unwillingness of buyers to look outside of their “preferred” areas. Both are a function of individual choice - particularly the latter. If first-time homebuyers *insist* their first home has to be a townhome in Brooklyn, condo in Miami, or SFH in bazillion dollar California? I can’t help you. There are great deals to be had all over in places like Ohio and the plains - and I guarantee folks, there are jobs in Omaha, Kansas City, etc to be had with affordable first homes nearby. Hey, I believe in personal choice and freedom - so absolutely, if you insist on living in a HCOL area? You’re going to pay HCOL prices and they’re likely beyond the means of a first-time homebuyer. That’s your choice. It’s nobody’s job to “fix” that - certainly not the government’s job. I do agree that those HCOL areas could lower costs by cutting regulations/zoning/barriers to building, so I suppose THAT would be the (local) government’s job to do less... but ultimately, people have a choice: Either pay the premium or consider areas where you don’t have to pay a premium. Right now MAGA has a chance to do something about it. I'd force Blackrock and the banks out of owning residential real estate, I'd ban non resident aliens from owning residential real estate and loosening any environmental regulations that hinder home building would be good steps. State and local governments need to ease strict zoning restrictions. Also, getting more younger Americans in good paying jobs by slashing H1Bs, imposing tariffs on foreign goods and deporting all the illegal aliens are positive steps. Cantillon Effects. California’s prices are insane. I had a buddy in business school....CPA, with four years of big 4 experience. He got hired by Silicon Valley Bank as a VP straight out of business school. His wife was a paralegal. With their combined salaries, they could not afford to buy a house in Silicon Valley. This was 25 years ago.

Title: RWA Platforms Keep Launching—Then Hitting the Same Regulatory Wall
URL: https://observer.com/2025/11/rwa-tokenization-cross-border-compliance/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:00:29Z

Real-world asset (RWA) platforms that offer regulated securities keep launching with the same playbook. They build for one jurisdiction, secure regulatory approval, and announce institutional partnerships, only to hit a wall when they need licensing to offer those assets across borders. The SEC, MiFID II and Singapore’s MAS all impose different rules on who can legally purchase securities, which means platforms need jurisdiction-specific approvals and must navigate conflicting investor eligibility rules for each new market.

You can opt out anytime. Recent projections by Standard Chartered suggest that the tokenized asset market could grow to $30 trillion by 2034. With BlackRock’s launch of tokenized fund BUIDL and Coinbase’s acquisition of crypto fundraising platform Echo, the institutional interest just keeps rising. But talk to anyone trying to put capital into tokenized assets at scale, and you’ll hear the same complaint: compliance has become a fragmentation nightmare. It’s not that institutions don’t want in. They do. The efficiency gains are obvious: fractional ownership, instant settlement and global liquidity pools. The problem is that every jurisdiction wants something different, and nobody’s built infrastructure that handles all of those differences without duct tape and manual workarounds. Launch a tokenized bond meant to work across multiple markets, and you’re navigating regulatory frameworks that fundamentally contradict each other. The SEC demands specific investor disclosures and accreditation checks. MiFID II requires different transparency standards. Being compliant means something entirely different depending on where your investors are located. Most platforms respond by staying in one jurisdiction. That’s fine for pilots and small-scale tests, but fails once you need institutional capital distributed across global markets. Those that attempt international expansion end up layering custom compliance systems for each region, often rebuilding core infrastructure every time. That approach caps your addressable market before you start. It explains why the technology keeps advancing while institutional adoption stalls. BlackRock can tokenize funds across seven blockchains, but if each blockchain operates in regulatory isolation, you haven’t solved the problem; you’ve just multiplied it. The next generation of RWA platforms won’t eliminate regulatory complexity, because that’s unrealistic given how different jurisdictions operate. What they can do is abstract it so the complexity becomes invisible to the end user. Think of it like payment processing. Stripe doesn’t ask merchants to build separate integrations for Visa, Mastercard, American Express and every regional payment method. You plug into Stripe once, and it handles all the backend complexity of routing transactions through different networks, applying the right fraud checks and managing compliance requirements across payment types. The merchant gets a single API, but customers can pay however they choose. Modular compliance tokenized assets should work the same way. You build your platform once with compliance layers that plug into a unified technology stack. When you tokenize an asset, the system automatically enforces jurisdiction-specific rules based on each investor’s location. It all happens programmatically, without anyone manually coordinating fifteen different regulatory regimes. The technology to do this already exists. Smart contracts can encode transfer restrictions by jurisdiction. Automated AML systems flag suspicious activity in real time. Reusable digital identity solutions handle cross-border KYC without forcing investors to resubmit documents for every platform they touch. What’s been missing is someone building these capabilities into a unified system that institutions trust and regulators can audit. Institutional investors don’t just want compliance in the abstract sense. They want concrete proof that they can show to regulators on demand. That means real-time reports that update automatically, immutable transaction records that can’t be altered after the fact, and the ability to demonstrate—at any time to any regulator—that every single trade followed all applicable rules from day one. Every question of who owned which asset, when and under what legal framework should have a clear, auditable answer. The platforms that win institutional adoption will be the ones where compliance isn’t something you retrofit onto an existing system but is something that’s native to how the platform operates from its core architecture. Every transaction should generate a proper audit trail automatically, every token transfer should validate all regulatory requirements before execution and every corporate action should get logged in ways that satisfy both blockchain transparency standards and traditional financial oversight requirements. If the first generation of RWA platforms proved that tokenization can work, the next must prove that it can scale. That won’t happen through more pilots or technical proofs of concept. It will require infrastructure designed for a fragmented regulatory world from day one. The future of tokenized finance won’t belong to whoever builds the flashiest blockchain integrations, but to whoever builds compliance that travels. Until platforms can offer global reach with local precision, the trillion-dollar opportunity in tokenized assets will remain trapped behind national borders.

Title: Economists agree: You’re not crazy for feeling like the rich get richer, and the poor are doing worse. Welcome to the ‘K-shaped economy’

Time Published: 2025-11-07T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. It all began with an anonymous Twitter handle named “Ivan the K.” The self-appointed “Lead Independent Director of Finance Twitter” had a dark theory in the depths of the pandemic. In 2020, they asked the universe, “Why is no one talking about a K recovery?” since there was much discussion at that time about an economic bounceback in the shape of either a U, an L, or, most bullish of all, a V. “Some things will bounce back,” Ivan wrote, “some will not recover. Think about it.” Economists seem to have thunk on it and agreed: The K is real. It bears similarities to another saying, invented nearly 200 years earlier by the great English romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley: “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.” This is also called “the Matthew effect,” as some trace the sentiment all the way back to the bible’s Book of Matthew 25:29: “For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.” If you ask Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, this old-time religion got a new lease on life in the Reaganomics of the 1980s. “You really start to see this in the Reagan era,” Zandi told Fortune. “That’s when you get a structural divergence between productivity growth and median wage growth.” Zandi argued that many elements combined then to weaken labor in favor of capital income: globalization, the decline of unions and manufacturing and major tax reforms. “The share of national income going to labor has been trending down since the early 1980s,” he said, “and the share going to capital owners—those who already have wealth—has gone up.” So what is it about 2025, five years after the pandemic severed something economically, that accelerated both sides of the “K” for the wealthy and the poor? First, consider the extraordinary surges in economic data seen, halfway through the 2020s. The stock market rallies have led to several record highs in 2025, incentivizing the (wealthier) Americans with money in the markets to loosen their purse strings. But the bottom half of the K is extending downwards, with fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Cava, and fast-food joints like McDonald’s, noting that lower-income customers, especially young people, are pulling back and preferring to dine at home. Zandi’s own research has turned up some stunning results, notably that in the second quarter of 2025 the top 10% of wealthiest Americans were responsible for a whopping 49% of consumer spending. That means the economy has grown so lopsided—or K-shaped—that the richest Americans are responsible for half the economy. The K-shape is creating the illusion in economic data that despite sticky inflation and tariff-related sticker shock, consumer spending remains “resilient.” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Lisa Shalett has increasingly been sounding the alarm from her perch as chief investment officer. She told Fortune in an October interview that “the income inequality stuff is really getting like completely wackadoo,” specifically citing Zandi’s research: “That means 90% of the country is only half the consumption, I mean holy cannoli.” Shalett covered the K-shaped economy specifically in a November 3 research note, in the context of whether 2026 marks an early or late stage of the economic cycle for investors. “Decoding this conundrum may hinge on the so-called K-shaped economy,” she wrote, “a concept that captures the widening chasm between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots.’” Then Shalett said the situation is actually even worse than what Zandi produced: “For the U.S. consumer, wealth concentration has produced a situation where the top 40% of households by income account for approximately 60% of all spending; those households, in turn, control nearly 85% of America’s wealth, two-thirds of which is directly tied to the stock market, which has climbed more than 90% in three years.” She calculated that spending by the wealthiest households was growing 6x-7x faster than for the lowest cohort. Even Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell talked about seeing the pattern at October’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “If you listen to the earnings calls or the reports of big, public, consumer-facing companies, many of them are saying that there’s a bifurcated economy there and that consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower cost products,” Powell said last week. “But at the top, people are spending, at the higher income and wealth.” The concept of a bifurcated economy has been baked into American society longer than even the days of Reagan, according to Tyler Schipper, associate professor of economics at the University of St. Thomas. “There’s this underlying thing that has been true for decades and decades and decades,” Schipper told Fortune. “Number one, lower income households always struggle more in the economy. They tend to be more impacted by price changes because they’re spending a higher percentage of their income. “And second, that it tends to be that after each recession, lower income workers fall further behind in the income distribution,” he added. Today, conversations around the shape of the American economy are more urgent because more of the middle class—and those making about $100,000 per year—are getting pushed into the lower half of the K, Schipper said. This can be seen in mid-income and higher-income earners flocking to discount retailers like Walmart and Dollar General. It can even take on more absurd forms, with “Ralph Lauren Christmas” trending at unprecedented levels heading into the projected $1 trillion 2025 holiday season, but TikTok and Instagram full of tips on how to achieve the look of red-tartan-plaid and cozy sweaters on a budget—in other words, not at an actually expensive Ralph Lauren store. That lower half of the K is extending ever downward as the consumer encounters a unique set of challenges, including the inflationary impact of tariffs, according to Schipper. Lower-income households tend to spend more on essential goods more likely to be impacted by tariffs. The Yale Budget Lab calculated that the levies impact the bottom of the income ladder more than three times more than the top. A low-fire, low-hire labor market has also contributed to evidence of a two-tiered economy, said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Federal Reserve economist. While tech layoffs have been top of mind following massive cuts from Amazon, layoff rates are still low, Sahm told Fortune, meaning if you have a job, you may feel more financially secure. If you’re just entering the job market like Gen Z is, you may have a hard time finding a job as firms contract following a post-COVID hiring spree, and as AI begins to displace entry-level jobs. To be sure, data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas released on Thursday found U.S. employers cut more than 150,000 jobs last month, the largest October reduction in two decades. But another part of the resurgence of discussions about a bifurcated economy comes from the relative nature of a K-shaped economy, according to Schipper. While the economy has historically been two-tiered, diverging consumer sentiment has also contributed to a narrative that two income groups are moving away from each other. For example, in 2022 when the stock market declined, consumer sentiment in both the top-third and bottom-third of income levels converged, according to data from the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers. A similar pattern occurred in April, when the announcement of Liberation Day tariffs spooked Americans across income levels, Schipper noted. Last month, however, consumer attitude toward the economy saw a greater split, with low-income Americans feeling far less confident about the economy than those high-income. Some economists point to the widening divide between the rich and the poor as a consequence of monetary policy. The Fed, over the past few years, has had a historic tightening cycle – eleven rate hikes between 2022 and 2024—which was meant to pare down inflation. However, it also reinforced the split since wealthy households, flush by years of asset appreciation, could weather the slowdown better than lower income households facing higher mortgage rates and shrinking credit, Zandi said. Cheap money in the 2010s and early pandemic years boosted stocks and home values, but the 2022-and-on tightening squeezed borrowers and renters without necessarily reversing those gains. That means even as inflation has cooled, the damage lingered as asset holders retained their windfall but wage earners bore the brunt of disinflation. “Folks in the top third of the income and wealth distribution are doing well, but the remaining two-thirds of Americans are struggling… they borrowed during the pandemic when rates were low, and now they’re having to pay on that debt at a higher rate,” Zandi said. Though Fed chair Powell has acknowledged today’s K-shaped economy, a restrictive monetary policy is helping keep it in place, Sahm argued, making it unlikely for the two diverging K lines to come any closer together. “We have a Fed that’s still trying to fight inflation that’s been elevated, and part of the tool that they have for fighting inflation is interest rates are elevated, and they’ve been elevated for some time,” Sahm said. “This is the way restrictive monetary policy works: It’s going to hit households hardest who are more financially constrained.” Zandi had a different perspective. He argued that the gap will require policy changes far beyond the Fed’s remit. “The Fed can’t fix the K-shaped economy,” he said. “It can only stabilize prices and employment. The distributional effects are up to fiscal policy.” Instead, Zandi argued for a reversal of some choices made on the fiscal side that would “do no harm” to lower-and-middle-income Americans. “Don’t impose tariffs—that exacerbates inequality,” he said. “Lower- and middle-income households spend a much higher share of their budget on imported products like food, clothing, and cars.” He also criticized President Donald Trump’s “highly restrictive” immigration policy, which he said hurts jobs for industries that rely on immigrants, such as construction, agriculture and manufacturing broadly. Beyond just addressing self-inflicting wounds, Zandi argued that progress depends on both structural and cyclical forces: raising productivity through education, broad-based jobs creation, and ensuring that gains from AI will be equally shared. “If the benefits of AI are distributed more broadly,” he said, “and if job losses are offset by new opportunities, we’ll be fine.” Clear evidence of a two-tiered economy doesn’t mean a recession is imminent, economists said. It does, however, mean that if economic indicators were to take a nosedive, the risk of a recession would increase. “The K-shaped economy, the bifurcated economy, is potentially a more vulnerable economy,” Sahm said. Though layoff rates are still relatively low, if the rate of job cuts increased, there would be many more people in a job market where there’s not much hiring. The labor market today doesn’t look like it did in the job-hopping era of 2023, even when interest rates were still high, Sahm noted. Right now, only the healthcare and hospitality sectors are adding jobs in earnest, creating a concentration of growth not optimal for economic stability. “Anytime you have that, you’re more vulnerable if something bad happens,” Sahm said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

A flurry of wealthtech announcements from Asset-Map and eMoney, Evergreen Wealth, Alphathena, d1g1t, and PreciseFP this week. November 7, 2025 GeoWealth, a turnkey asset management platform, introduced a Private Model Marketplace that coalesces strategies it's been amassing for the past year using models constructed by Apollo, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Through GeoWealth’s unified managed account technology, advisors using the platform can build custom models or pick from pre-built ones that include exposure to private markets. Users can create standalone models or combine them with public models in the same custodial account. “We built the Private Model Marketplace to provide advisors with a turnkey, fully managed solution that delivers private market exposure without the operational burden,” GeoWealth CEO Colin Falls said in a statement. “We believe the industry is in its early days of private markets adoption, and our purpose-built technology will help RIAs meet client demand in these asset classes.” The move is the culmination of a series of announcements. In June 2024, the firm raised $18 million in growth investment funding, with BlackRock as a new lead investor. Then this past August, it raised $38 million in Series C funding led by Apollo. The two firms also announced a partnership centered on public-private model portfolios. Related:The Word on WealthTech for October 2025 In addition, just over one year ago, GeoWealth announced partnerships with Goldman Sachs and iCapital centered around bringing private market options to models. It forged a similar pact with J.P. Morgan Asset Management last month. Advisors using both Asset-Map and eMoney Advisor are now able to import their clients’ planning data from the latter and take full advantage of the visual storytelling tools in the former, thanks to a new integration announced between the two this week. Simply put, vast numbers of advisors rely on eMoney to perform complex and comprehensive financial planning for their clients, but using Asset-Map, advisors can visually illustrate the context of entire households and their assets, helping to simplify conversations and more clearly delineate and present household recommendations. And with the integration, Asset-Map reports can be easily dropped into the eMoney vault. A live demonstration from both teams online is scheduled for Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET (registration required). A month after a splashy launch, the new RIA created by former Personal Capital CEO Bill Harris, Evergreen Wealth, has announced a key third-party technology partnership. Related:Summit Financial: A Wealthstack For All Apex Fintech Solutions Inc. will provide its AscendOS a real-time, cloud-based investment platform, to power Evergreen’s investing platform, Dynamic Portfolios. Evergreen’s mission, once its technology stack is in place, is to serve “investors with a hyper-personalized, tax-optimized index of individual securities tuned to their specific goals, risk tolerance, tax rate and values, to deliver sophisticated, after-tax wealth management once reserved for ultra-high-net-worth clients,” according to a statement. Alphathena, which specializes in AI-enhanced direct indexing for financial advisors, announced this week the launch of Long/Short Leveraged Direct Indexing, providing advisors with access to an investing approach that was previously used by and mainly available only to institutional investors. Using the new technology will require margin accounts at Schwab, Fidelity or Interactive Brokers, but there are no additional fees or setup required at this time. The company launched at the end of 2022 and was named Best in Show at the 2023 Morningstar Fintech Showcase, and this year was the winner of the 2025 WealthManagement.com Industry Award for Direct Indexing. Related:The WealthStack Podcast: The Digital Experience Platform Playbook with Tom Fields d1g1t (pronounced “digit”), an enterprise provider of advisory technology headquartered in Canada that serves the U.S. advisory market, announced this week that it has re-engineered the core data and processing layers of its platform to deliver better performance, scalability and resilience, enabling it to support millions of accounts and accelerate more complex operations, including reporting, rebalancing and billing. According to the firm, the updates allow for faster load times, boosted performance for real-time calculations and data rendering. Core components have also been upgraded to reduce disruptions and ensure uptime. There have also been improvements in linking research to individual securities meant to help streamline due diligence. The firm rolled out extensive billing features and a Unified Managed Accounts framework a year ago. PreciseFP, the venerable client engagement and data gathering tool popular with advisors and acquired by Docupace in 2021, announced a significant upgrade to its user interface as well as new AI tools this week. The interface refresh is meant to streamline navigation and present a cleaner, more simplified layout, while the AI Template Builder, which is in beta, enables firms to create complete, client-ready forms in seconds, drastically reducing prep times. Docupace recently rolled out integrations with Focal, Flextract and Zocks.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. It's no-Jobs Friday! Thanks to the government shutdown, we won't get new employment data. But don't worry, we have you covered with a roundup of private figures. Rundown But first, let's get in touch with the populace. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings Earnings season has been good. Perhaps… too good. The run-ups in the stock market's favorite tech darlings after earnings last week apparently pushed valuations to a point where investors decided they'd had enough. It's led to a chaotic current week, with two separate valuation-driven sell-offs in a matter of three days. The institutional class is as split as ever over what the future holds. JPMorgan is recommending investors buy any dips. Billionaire Ray Dalio sees a short-term rally, and then a Fed-driven sell-off. And then there's the overhang of what will happen with President Trump's tariffs, which are facing a prolonged legal battle. But that only tells part of the story. As retail investing has exploded in popularity, so has the influence of the day-traders populating Reddit and Discord forums. Their behavior can often be a harbinger of what's to come, and the strategy team JPMorgan has conveniently been keeping tabs. Here are the four main themes that have dominated retail trading over the past week as volatility has raged. They went on their biggest buying spree in four months, almost entirely in mega-cap tech But they're not blindly buying market dips They're getting tired of gold and bitcoin after torrid rallies They're most excited about these meme stocks Judging by a "social interest score" tracked by JPMorgan, the "most hyped" stocks this past week were: Beyond Meat, Nokia, POET Technologies, UiPath, Palantir, Nvidia, Chipotle, and Reddit. Are you a retail investor that's leaning into these trends, or doing something completely different? Let us know what portfolio moves you've been making at firsttrade@businessinsider.com. On the heels of another difficult day in the market, console yourself with another example of the value-creating impact of AI deals. Snap stock surged as much as 18% after announcing a $400 million partnership with Perplexity AI, to incorporate its AI search engine into Snapchat. It's a good reminder that — even on the toughest of days — AI deals trump all, and can carry a stock to market-beating performance. Is the gig up for gold? At least as an S&P 500-crushing speculative asset? It appears so. Following a 20% run up through September and into October, the price of the precious metal has come back down to earth. The chart above, from JPMorgan, reflects a corresponding shift in sentiment, specifically among retail investors. Note the blue line, which shows that retail buying has plateaued. Each Friday, I'll discuss and review a piece of markets- or finance-related media: movies, books, TV shows, podcasts, etc. Today's entry is the movie "Boiler Room" (2000). There are some quotes at the beginning of "Boiler Room" — namely "I just want to get in" and "nobody wants to work for it anymore" — that echo the frivolous, fundamental-lite stock market activity that characterized the meme stock era. Right away, you know this is a movie that's going to deal with a popular evergreen theme: how to get rich quick. This film is best approached by suspending belief around the illegalities occurring. The schemes are sub-Wolf-of-Wall-Street penny-stock pump and dumps, where the companies don't even exist. It would never happen, at least this flagrantly, but that's not the point. It's all merely a vessel for the movie's top-notch cast of wisecracking early-2000s actors masquerading as stock-brokers. Vin Diesel executes a pitch-perfect sales call in front of 100 associates, closing the deal to rapt applause. Ben Affleck — the firm's head recruiter — delivers two scintillating motivational monologues to a room full of new hires. Key quote: "Anybody who tells you that money is the root of all evil, doesn't f**king have any." Leading man Giovanni Ribisi excels as a whip-smart, money-hungry youngster who's looking to make the leap from backroom poker games to stock-broking millionaire. And it feels like Jamie Kennedy is acting in a different movie — perhaps channeling his "Malibu's Most Wanted" character at some points — but it doesn't matter, he steals every scene he's in. At one point, the core group of brokers sit around trading extended recitations of the original "Wall Street." There's an analogy in there somewhere. Of course, the movie doesn't take place exclusively within the walls of the Long Island-based JT Marlin (yes, it's that obvious of a play on JPMorgan). The crew ventures into NYC a handful of times to beat up rival brokers from the "real" Wall Street, and party at a hotel in celebration of a new (fraudulent) IPO launch. These are electric and hilarious scenes, and they show that the movie is at its strongest when the core cast is ripping it up, even if a lot of the dialogue is offensive enough to be left in the year 2000. It's not the best finance movie of all time. But, for my money, it's the most fun. And for that reason it gets a 10/10 rating. Do you have any ideas about what I should review next?

Title: U.S. investors dump $700M in Bitcoin – Is BTC’s $100K support at risk?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/u-s-investors-dump-700m-in-bitcoin-is-btcs-100k-support-at-risk/
Time Published: 2025-11-07T13:00:14Z

Here’s why Bitcoin could drop to $95K in November. Major economic zones were aggressively selling Bitcoin, with the US at the forefront. The odds of Bitcoin reaching $95,000 have climbed to 48%. Bitcoin [BTC] was trading near the $100K mark at press time. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has dropped by 1.5%, with further downside possible due to widespread selling pressure globally. The U.S. was leading in selling BTC, at the time of writing, as seen in the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index. The index has been in the red region since the 30th of October, reflecting the massive dumping by U.S. entities. For instance, BlackRock sold 6,800 BTC valued at more than $700 million, averaging about $30 million per transaction. The entity did not seem to stop this capital outflow from Bitcoin and its products ahead of the Fed announcement. Source: CoinGlass Additionally, Bitcoin ETF flows turned positive after six consecutive days of outflows. As per a post by Satoshi Staker, BTC ETFs saw about $240 million in inflows in the past 24 hours, though it was not enough to counter the outflows. The aggressive dumping by US entities made any reversal difficult, as other jurisdictions also mirrored this behavior. The chances of a market reversal were low, as selling pressure extended across Asia and the European Union. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s Cumulative Return By Session fell from roughly +3% to -4%, reflecting growing bearish momentum. Bearish sentiment intensified, with sellers dominating each session. On the 6th of November, sell orders far outweighed ETF inflows, effectively wiping out buy-side demand. Source: Velo This sentiment was reflected in Polymarket’s prediction markets about “What price will Bitcoin hit in November?” The chances of BTC dipping to $95,000 rose to 48%, while the odds of a decline to $90,000 now stand at 24%. Meanwhile, chances of BTC climbing to $115,000 or higher have fallen, averaging between 2% and 8%. Overall market sentiment remains tilted toward selling, likely influenced by the AI bubble, record job cuts, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. In addition, global tariff tensions have added further pressure on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. As the odds of a reversal continue to shrink, the CVD divergences could hint at when to anticipate one. According to Hyblock Capital data, whenever selling exceeded buying on shorter timeframes, prices tended to close higher, and vice versa. Source: Hyblock Capital Altogether, Bitcoin was undergoing massive sell pressure across the globe, explaining the current weakness. Therefore, a recovery could happen only when bids outweighed asks and aggressive selling halted.

Title: You can’t sit down! Peloton warns 900,000 customers to stop using bikes following reports of seat posts breaking and falling off

Like this site? Help us to make it better. We’re not sure if anyone working at Peloton is a fan of early 60s doo-wop group The Dovells. But if they are, the American band’s 1963 hit ‘You Can’t Sit Down’ would form a rather apt soundtrack for the fitness brand’s offices this week. On Thursday, Peloton issued a voluntary recall notice for almost 900,000 of its Original Series Bike+ models, following reports of a seat post defect which causes it to break and fall off, potentially resulting in, the company says, “injury risk” for users. Peloton has received three reports of the seat posts breaking and detaching during use, and two reports of injuries as a result of falls. Approximately 833,000 models have since been recalled in the US, while 44,800 bikes sold in Canada may also be affected, though Peloton says it is yet to receive any reports of seat posts breaking from its Canadian customers. The American company has warned users affected by the recall to stop using the Original Series Bike+ model immediately, while offering customers a free replacement seat post, which can be self-installed at home. > Peloton set to charge customers £70 for using second-hand bikes, as brand’s sales finally rise by 0.2%, prompting shares to surge months after large-scale redundancies and restructuring The recall applies to Original Series Bike+ models manufactured in Taiwan between December 2019 and July 2022, which were sold in the United States and Canada from January 2020 to April 2025. The bikes were sold by Peloton directly, as well as through third-party retailers such as eBay, Amazon, and Dick’s Sporting Goods, retailing at $2,495. Peloton says the affected models can be identified by the PL02 model number and a serial number beginning with the letter ‘T’, on the label located inside the front fork, behind the front fork, or behind the flywheel. “The integrity of our products and our members’ well-being are our top priorities,” Marcio Oliveira, Peloton’s senior vice president of Global Hardware Operations and Product Safety, said in a statement. “The recall is due to the fact that the Original Series Bike+ seat post assembly can break during use, posing fall and injury hazards to the user. “Peloton has received three reports of seat posts breaking out of approximately 833,000 units sold in the US. Peloton has received no reports of a seat post breaking, out of 44,800 units sold in Canada. “We are taking this opportunity to make replacement seat posts available to all affected Bike Plus users and we encourage them to contact us to receive the redesigned seat post as soon as possible.” > Peloton reports a defect in its bike seats after users report injuries, also announces ninth straight quarter of loss This latest recall comes over two years after Peloton issued an even larger recall notice concerning a faulty seat post, following the indentation of a defect in its Original Series PL-01 model, affecting 2.2 million of its entry-level bikes. That recall, issued in May 2023, came after 35 reports from users that the seat post was vulnerable to breaking at the weld joint, leading to 13 injuries, one customer sustaining a fractured wrist, cuts, and bruises. Last year, we reported that, after a turbulent period characterised by restructuring, a curtailed retailed presence, and a series of layoffs, Peloton saw its first sales increase in nine quarters, beating analysts’ estimates and sending shares surging as much as 41 per cent. That rare bit of positive news came as the American fitness company controversially confirmed that it will start charging customers a £72 “activation fee” when they buy one of their exercise bikes second-hand. In May 2024, at the same time CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down, 15 per cent of Peloton’s workforce (around 400 people) was made redundant in another round of cuts. This latest cull, McCarthy claimed, was necessary to bring the New York-based brand’s spending in line with its revenue, following three years of continuous losses thanks to sales of connected indoor fitness equipment plummeting as Covid-era restrictions eased.

Title: It’s Part of the Game: Matt Tuttle on Closing ETFs and Looking to the Stars

ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle to discuss his approach to ETFs and what has him so interested in alien technology. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Matthew Tuttle isn’t necessarily looking to be in most portfolios. In fact, he said his company’s strategies are better fits for clients seeking high risks and high rewards, and they often speak more directly to Reddit day traders with Robinhood accounts than moms and pops with IRAs. Tuttle Capital Management has a slew of 2x single-stock funds, and tries to avoid strong correlation with major indexes. It’s also not afraid to bet on out-of-this-world ideas. “The S&P 500 is great, but launching an S&P 500 fund is never going to work from our standpoint,” Tuttle said. ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle recently to discuss his approach to ETFs, what happens when a fund doesn’t work out and what has him so interested in alien technology. ETF Upside: What’s the philosophy behind your ETFs? Matt Tuttle: I’m an active trader, so a good idea is something I would buy. I’m not going to launch a product that I wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot pole. It’s also got to be something that I can market. My space is with self-directed investors and some independent advisors. I can’t compete with BlackRock, so I’m never getting into Merrill Lynch, UBS or anything like that. A fund needs to be different from what’s already out there. Being first is huge, especially for us. BlackRock can be 10th, and it doesn’t matter. For me, we’ve got to be first. If we’re not first, I’m probably not interested. The UFO Disclosure AI Powered ETF turned some heads. What prompted filing for that fund? This is something I’ve been fascinated with since I was a kid. Where that fascination turned into a product started in 2017 when The New York Times broke a story about a secret Pentagon group that was tracking UFOs. They provided footage of fighter pilots chasing these Tic Tac things that moved in ways that theoretically are impossible. Everyone’s asking, “Are they aliens? Are they Chinese? Are they this or that?” which are all great questions. But I’m looking at that and saying, “What energy source are they using?” We’ve been having these Congressional meetings where people are testifying, saying we are reverse-engineering some of this technology. This topic has so much disinformation in it that it’s hard to know what to believe, but if that technology were to ever surface, it would be a game-changer. I was trading in the early days of the internet. I’m now actively trading AI stocks. If a source of free energy were made available, it would be the biggest thing ever, so I filed an ETF for it. I had serious people, not the tinfoil hat people, but serious people reaching out to me — people high up in big investment firms, reporters, venture capitalists, academics, those who had been in the defense industry — saying this was really cool and the tech exists. Also, if we’re ever going to get the truth, I think this [Trump] administration is going to be the one that does it. You’ve filed for and issued a lot of single-stock or single-asset funds. What advantages do you see in those? We’ve really created an ecosystem with them. When we first started doing this, it was Tesla and Nvidia, and that was it. But now there’s more and more money going into more and more stocks, and post-covid, that market has gotten more thematic. There’s a group of stocks today that I think people would call meme stocks, but I don’t like that. Yesterday’s meme stocks were AMC and GameStop, which were crap companies that hedge funds would short, rightfully so. But then a bunch of retail investors banded together to crush the hedge funds. Now you’ve got a bunch of companies that are positioned to take off tomorrow. You could argue these are companies that don’t have any earnings, but they’re also positioned at the forefront of where the world is going. A lot of these stocks are not crap companies, they’re just early. Covid changed everything because you had these guys working from home, no boss over their shoulders, and they started trading stocks. They got fed up with just putting their money in the S&P 500 and earning 8% to 12% a year. They started connecting on social media, and they’re a powerful force. I just got back from Korea, and they love this stuff. You’re not allowed to gamble in Korea, so I think this is their gambling. There’s also a lot of places where people can’t buy Bitcoin, but they can buy a 2x long in MicroStrategy, so that’s what they do as the alternative. There’s a lot going on that has contributed to the rise of these 2X long single-stocks. What happens when an ETF just doesn’t work out and has to fold? It’s part of the game. As long as I have the vision of getting the fund to $15 million, I’m going to launch something. But sometimes, that doesn’t come to pass. The one that really bothered me was the inverse [Jim] Cramer fund. A lot of it was timing. If I had come out with it in 2022, we’d have billions of dollars in it, and it would’ve been awesome. I came out with it in 2023 a few months before Nvidia shared its earnings, showed the world AI is here, and the Mag 7 basically quadrupled. Everything else he calls turns to crap, but he got the Mag 7 right, and he wasn’t moving off of it. I can’t have an inverse Cramer fund and be intellectually honest about it when my personal account is loaded to the gills with the Mag 7. That one sucked. I really wanted to make it work. ETFs that focus on clean energy investments in the US and globally have been outperforming the wider market this year, and by no small margin. The success of money market funds and their ETF counterparts has coincided with low interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Net flows of ETFs reached yet another record last month, and actively managed products also captured more market share. The pace of ETF launches and fund conversions is picking up, but there is a challenge to find shelf space at broker-dealers. Nearly a dozen ex-China funds have launched since 2023. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners, along with venture capital firm General Catalyst, is trying to buy Janus Henderson, and an AI makeover could be in its future. Investors who want in on Alpha Architect’s next 351 exchange ETF no longer need at least $1 million — as long as their account is at Charles Schwab. The legacy mutual fund provider has filed for a crypto index fund, bringing TradFi and DeFi one step closer together. Pictet Asset Management, which oversees $800 billion, recently launched three ETFs that lean on AI, with plans to add two emerging markets strategies early next year. The Goldman Sachs MSCI World Private Equity Return Tracker ETF does its best to replicate PE performance with publicly traded stocks. Banks are writing off hundreds of millions of dollars in loan defaults, and the wind down in CLO trading may not be a bad thing. The acquisition marks one of the first major purchases of an ETF provider by a US crypto trading platform. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: How Tesla has prepared to defend Musk's mega pay package from legal challenges

Every time Tom publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tesla won the war for Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package. Now it's prepared to win future legal battles. Shareholders voted to approve the record-breaking compensation plan by a 75% margin on Thursday, paving the way for Musk to become the world's first trillionaire should he meet a series of ambitious product and financial goals. It came after the Tesla CEO's previous $56 billion pay package, which was approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018 and again in 2024, was struck down by a Delaware judge last year following an investor lawsuit. Since then, Tesla has made a series of moves to ensure Musk's $1 trillion payday doesn't suffer the same fate. The EV giant has relocated its legal home from Delaware to Texas after gaining shareholder approval for the move at its 2024 annual meeting. In May, the Lone Star State passed SB 29 and SB 1057, two bills that make it much harder for small shareholders to bring legal challenges against companies. Under SB 29, litigants must now prove in a lawsuit that a company's directors are not acting in good faith and that they have engaged in fraud or violated the law. The bill also introduced a new rule that shareholders have to own at least 3% of the company's shares to bring legal action, also known as a derivative lawsuit. The threshold is not automatically applied to companies, but Tesla incorporated it into its bylaws in May. Only Musk himself and a handful of large, institutional investors, including BlackRock and Vanguard Group, own more than 3% of Tesla — and although shareholders can club together, $42 billion worth of shares is a high bar to meet. By contrast, the lawsuit that led to the Delaware Court of Chancery's ruling on Musk's previous pay package was bought by Richard Tornetta, a former heavy-metal drummer who owned just nine Tesla shares at the time. The judge in the Tornetta case ruled that Musk was too close to some of Tesla's board members for them to act independently, and that Tesla's board did not do enough to justify how it arrived at the package's $56 billion figure. Legal professors told Business Insider that it would be far more difficult for shareholders to bring legal challenges against Musk's new pay package in Texas. "I think that it would be a very hard road to challenge this in court," said William Magnuson, a professor of law at Texas A&M University, citing the changes to Texas law that have granted heightened legal protection for company directors. "All of these really have greatly limited the ability of shareholders to challenge misbehavior by boards of directors," he said. James Spindler, a corporate and securities law professor at the University of Texas, agreed. He said that while Tesla shareholders could still challenge the level of disclosure surrounding the pay package under Texas law, as Tornetta did in Delaware, the 3% standing threshold made the prospect of a similar lawsuit unlikely. "For a public company, that's probably going to be the end of the matter. When you're talking about a multibillion-dollar company, there just aren't going to be that many people that own 3% of the shares," Spinder added. After a Delaware court struck down his last pay package, Musk urged other companies to leave the state, and several have followed Tesla and SpaceX's lead. The Diamond state has since tweaked its corporate law provisions to make it harder for small shareholders to bring derivative lawsuits. Delaware's move came as states like Texas and Nevada attempt to woo big companies with their own director-friendly regulations, and Magnuson said that companies are increasingly seeking to move to states with "friendlier" corporate law statutes that place more limits on shareholder's rights. "I think that we're at the beginning of a real sea change in the way that corporate law works," he added. Jump to

Title: Bitcoin ETFs snap 6-day outflow streak as key trendline is back in focus

BlackRock and Fidelity led a rebound in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows on Thursday, as traders shifted their focus to the 50-week EMA at about $100,000. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETFs recorded $240 million in inflows on Thursday, ending a six-day outflow streak. Bitcoin’s failure to drop below the 50-day EMA suggests strong support in this area. Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ended a six-day outflow streak with inflows returning on Thursday, leading traders to say they believe that a recovery is imminent as long as the BTC price holds the 50-week EMA. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a six-day streak of net outflows on Thursday, with $240 million in daily inflows. The outflow streak started on Oct. 29 and extended through Wednesday, with the biggest outflows comprising $577.74 million on Tuesday. Related: Crypto ETFs ‘punching above weight’ as almost half of ETF investors plan buys The streak of outflows followed a Bitcoin market correction that saw BTC price plunge below $100,000 for the first time since June. On Tuesday, the BTC/USD pair reached a four-month low of $98,900. The price had recovered 3% on Friday. The largest inflow was to BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT, at $112.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $61.6 million, while ARK Invest’s ARKB added $60.4 million. Bitwise’s BITB posted moderate inflows of $5.5 million and $2.48 million, while the rest of the ETFs saw no inflows or outflows. Cumulative net inflows remain robust at $60.5 billion, and total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $135.43 billion, accounting for 5.42% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. After dropping to $98,000 on Tuesday, Bitcoin quickly reclaimed the $100,000 psychological level, which coincided with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA). This suggested that bulls were aggressively defending this level. Note that this trendline (yellow line in the chart below) has supported the price since September 2023, and losing it would be detrimental for the bulls. Bitcoin is “sitting right at the 50-week SMA, the line in the sand,” wrote YouTuber Lark Davis in a Thursday post on X, adding: “So far Bitcoin is still holding the 50-week EMA,” pseudonymous technical analyst Chad said, adding that it is important for the BTC/USD pair to close the week above this level. Fellow analyst Rekt Capital wrote that Bitcoin appears to be bottoming out around the 50-day EMA and must make a “cluster of lower lows” at this level to establish a bottom. As Cointelegraph reported, the MVRV ratio (market value to realized value) suggested $98,000 may have indeed marked the local bottom for BTC, suggesting that the price can recover due to seller exhaustion.

Title: They got laid off from the Microsoft country club and dumped into a hellish job market

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. After 31 years at Microsoft, Mike Kostersitz never saw it coming. In May, his team met with a senior leader about a new product. "Everybody was happy with the progress," said Kostersitz, then a principal product manager lead working on Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure. "Everything was peachy." The following morning, he noticed a high-priority virtual meeting had been added to his calendar — and it wasn't good news. "Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated," said the Washington-based 60-year-old. His manager and two of his direct reports were also among the 6,000 employees affected. In July, roughly 9,000 more were laid off. Previously, in January and February, Microsoft had made nearly 2,000 performance-based cuts. I spoke with seven of the Microsoft workers who lost their jobs over the past 12 months. Microsoft was once known for its "country club" culture, but as Ashley Stewart reported for Business Insider earlier this year, leaders worried the company had gone soft, and it ramped up scrutiny on performance. Inside Business is today's must-read story on what the forces shaping business, tech, and innovation mean for you. Each piece delivers insights to help you make smarter career, money, and life decisions. A Microsoft spokesperson has said that most of this year's cuts were not performance-based but were intended to reduce management layers and streamline operations. Along with Amazon, Meta, and Google, Microsoft is one of many companies — from Silicon Valley to corporate America — that are fueling the Great Flattening. The tenure of the ex-Microsofters I spoke to ranged from a few years to more than three decades. Some said any sense of job security they once had was shattered. Several said they were caught off guard by their layoffs, citing factors like long tenure, no documented performance issues, and Microsoft's position as the world's third-most valuable company. They wondered: If job security is dead at Microsoft, will they find it anywhere else? Kostersitz is one of them. To help with his job search, he said a Microsoft-funded career advisor recommended he "de-age" his résumé by erasing work done in the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now only shows professional experience since 2003. The advisor also emphasized that today's job market is an endurance test. "They said it's a game of chicken right now," he said. "The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job." Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers.

Read more on the topic: The experiences of laid-off Microsoft employees are part of a broader shift in corporate America. As Business Insider's Aki Ito has reported, job security was a defining feature of white-collar work during the postwar boom, a period when layoffs and firings were rare. However, globalization — and the overseas competition that accompanied it — gave rise to a new management philosophy focused on cost-cutting, downsizing, and viewing employees as interchangeable. It's not just about flattening. In cuts this year, companies have cited AI — if not directly for taking jobs, then for creating an environment in which companies can operate with leaner staff. It's what workers have been fearing will happen on a large scale as AI continues to improve and become increasingly omnipresent. While Microsoft's culture has evolved over the years, some laid-off employees said they believe the recent cuts show the company has entered a new era — one where avoiding layoffs appears to be a lower priority. The former Microsoft employees, in addition to dozens of other laid-off workers I've spoken with over the past year, told me they are grappling with how to protect their careers and financial well-being after an unexpected chop. Before Eduardo Noriega was laid off by Microsoft in May, he'd been nervous about his job security since 2009, when the company cut about 5,000 workers. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle. After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a side business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. By the time he was cut in May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit Microsoft and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in. "I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit." For other workers across corporate America, the challenge of landing a new role in today's economy has upped the stakes of sudden unemployment. While layoffs across the broader economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar roles have been particularly vulnerable. At the same time, US businesses are hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013. "If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job," said Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, she said, the shift may feel especially stark. Ian Carter began working at Microsoft in 2021, and he said the company's layoffs in 2023 and 2024 sent a clear message: His job wasn't safe. "It felt like it didn't matter if you were a great worker or not," said the 33-year-old. "Everybody was at risk." Since being laid off in May from his position as a technical program manager, he has struggled to find a job. He drew on savings for several months to cover expenses and switched to a month-to-month lease on his Redmond, Washington, apartment — crossing his fingers that he'd land something soon. But he never did. In late October, he stored his belongings and moved to Florida to live with his family and save money while continuing his search. "Rent is expensive," he said, "but rent without income coming in is doubly expensive." In May, Joe Friend learned that he and 14 other members of his working group had been laid off. Friend's tenure at Microsoft spanned more than two decades across three stints, but this was the first time he hadn't left by choice. Friend said he believes there's been a culture shift within Microsoft — one that's left employees with less job security than they once had. Some of his concerns extend beyond Microsoft to Big Tech more broadly — which is why he plans to be highly selective about his next role. "I think I'd rather earn $50,000 a year doing something I'm excited about," said the 62-year-old. "It doesn't mean I won't jump back into a job, but it certainly won't be Big Tech." Deborah Hendersen took a different approach. After 14 years at Microsoft, Hendersen, a user researcher in the company's Xbox division, was one of about 9,000 employees laid off in July. "It wasn't so much like watching a car wreck," said the 45-year-old, who lives in Seattle. "It was more like you were in the car, knowing it was going to wreck." The moment she received a mysterious meeting invite that she suspected would bring bad news, she began laying the groundwork for her future. She shared a message internally and on LinkedIn to tell her network that she'd been laid off and to learn who else had been affected. This led to the creation of a Discord chat of more than a dozen affected colleagues, where people shared job opportunities, helped each other prepare for interviews, vented their frustrations, and celebrated their successes. Hendersen also turned to her network to find openings and secure referrals. One of the roles recommended to her was a user experience researcher position at Meta. She received a referral and, in late August, a job offer. Hendersen credited her network — and in particular her laid-off colleagues — for supporting her during this challenging period. "It's so helpful to have the support of other people who are going through it — both the highs and the lows," she said. "Because everybody gets turned down, gets their hopes up, and is just figuring out how to remain sane in a really challenging time." Jump to

Title: Is the job market getting worse? As the shutdown continues, this is what we know

Scott Horsley The government shutdown has delayed a report on the October job market. That leaves policymakers looking for other signals about the pace of hiring and firing. Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America hide caption The government shutdown is again making it it hard to answer a critical question: How is the U.S. job market doing? The impasse in Congress over funding has delayed a closely-watched report on the labor market for the second month in a row. Without that official jobs tally, the available signals are mixed. This week, a big payroll processing company reported an uptick in October hiring, for example. But a consulting firm that tracks pink slips noted a big surge in layoff notices. Policymakers typically look to monthly surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the broadest and most accurate snapshot of the job market. But BLS number-crunchers have been furloughed for more than five weeks, so the September and October jobs reports have not been published. "Due to the government shutdown, this is a challenging time to give an economic outlook speech," Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook told an audience at the Brookings Institution on Monday. "The longer the shutdown lasts, the more data could be disrupted." But Cook insisted she and her colleagues are not "flying blind." They look to private-sector data for signals about hiring and firing, as well as anecdotal reports from a wide range of business contacts. Workers and people looking for work do the same, as they form their own impressions of the job market — and there are signs of concern. A measure of employee sentiment from the job-search website Glassdoor found workers are less confident about the availability of jobs now than they've been in the last three months. Glassdoor users who received a job offer in October were less likely to turn it down than the previous month, suggesting that workers feel they have less leverage in the current market. "October's decline in employee confidence reflects how quickly economic uncertainty can ripple through the workforce," said Glassdoor's chief economist Daniel Zhao. "The government shutdown and mounting layoff fears have clearly shaken employee sentiment." A number of high-profile companies such as Amazon and UPS have announced widespread layoffs in recent weeks, which likely weighs on workers' confidence. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says U.S. businesses announced plans to cut 153,074 jobs last month — the worst October in more than two decades. Tech firms and warehousing companies reported some of the biggest downsizing plans. "Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market," says Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer at the firm. State tallies of new unemployment claims have remained relatively stable, however, suggesting that there hasn't been a big spike in overall layoffs yet. On the positive side, ADP, which handles payroll for more than 26 million U.S. employees, says it counted an increase in the number of private-sector employees last month, after two months of decline. "Private employers added jobs in October for the first time since July," says ADP's chief economist Nela Richardson. At the same time, Richardson notes that "hiring was modest relative to what we reported earlier this year." A recruiter speaks with job seekers at a job fair held in Sunrise, Fl., on Sept. 25, 2025. Joe Raedle/Getty Images North America hide caption Official data from the BLS had also shown a slowdown in hiring during the summer, before the government shutdown halted its reporting. Employers added just 22,000 jobs in August — the last month for which official numbers are available. Some of the drop in job growth could be the result of having fewer available workers. Some 10,000 baby boomers retire every day. And the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement likely means there are fewer foreign-born workers in the job market. While the unemployment rate inched up to 4.3% in August, that's still quite low by historical standards. "The slightly rising unemployment rate indicates the labor market is softening, but only modestly so," Cook said Monday. She cautioned however that unemployment rates for young and African American workers jumped more sharply over the summer, which could be a warning sign. The jobless rate for workers aged 20-24 in August was 9.2% while the unemployment rate among African Americans was 7.5%. "This is sometimes called a "two-speed" economy," Cook said, "when the well-off are doing well, while [lower-income families] and vulnerable households are not." Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: For the Movement That Elected Zohran Mamdani, Now Comes the Hard Part

To win bold demands, social movements must go on the offensive. Holding political office is not the same as wielding political power—especially for the left. To win bold demands, social movements must go on the offensive. New Yorkers celebrate as NY1 projects Zohran Mamdani to win the New York City mayoral election in the Astoria neighborhood of New York City on November 4, 2025. By electing Zohran Mamdani mayor, New York City made history. Now comes the hard part. Holding political office is not the same thing as wielding political power—especially for the left. The CEOs of Blackrock, Vanguard, KKR, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are not suddenly going to say, “OK, socialists, you won. Here are the keys to the city.” Mamdani won’t be successful on his own. The question is now: Will the nascent social movement behind Mamdani rise to meet the challenge? To win the bold demands that powered Mamdani’s campaign and to tap into the growing popular energy nationally, the emerging social movement must go on the offensive. The CEOs are already girding for class war over the campaign’s signature issues—taxing the rich, a rent freeze, universal childcare, fast and free buses, and public groceries. They don’t want to pay for these things, and they really don’t want to give up power and control of the city. What we win in the end will be determined not by polling numbers or viral social media memes or a mayor friendly to socialist policies, but by the balance of forces between the social movement and our opponents. This requires mounting campaigns that go far beyond the traditional political advocacy of lobbying, petitions, and testimony. Just as unionized workers win demands by threatening to disrupt business with strikes, we will have to show our opponents that there is a cost to denying working people the campaign’s central demands. That means escalating toward large and disruptive actions, enough to shake the CEOs and the political establishment into making concessions. For anyone who has been involved in organizing a union before, the big-business assault on Mamdani so far has been familiar: intimidation, co-optation, outright lying, and division. But the reaction now will be orders of magnitude greater than any union-busting campaign. CEOs and billionaires—and the media beholden to them—are already stoking fear and anxiety with the specter of capital strikes and capital flight. “If Mamdani becomes the mayor of New York, you’re going to see the flight of businesses from New York,” predicted billionaire hedge fund executive Bill Ackman after Mamdani’s primary win. “Billionaire CEO warns he’ll close grocery stores if democratic socialist candidate wins NYC mayor race,” blared a post-primary Fox News headline. Democratic Party leaders, while temporarily stunned by the movement’s strength, will recover their footing and work tirelessly to buy off, divert, and stymie the burgeoning socialist energy. Governor Kathy Hochul, even while endorsing Mamdani, has laid down her political marker: no new taxes on the rich—in direct opposition to Mamdani’s core platform. And then there’s Trump. In the coming months—and maybe much sooner—Trump likely will deploy the National Guard in New York City and cut off federal funding. But if we anticipate the coming reactions, we can properly prepare, organize, and fight back. My new book, We’re Coming for You and Your Rotten System: How Socialists Beat Amazon and Upended Big-City Politics, chronicles how movements led by Kshama Sawant, a socialist who held one seat in a nine-member city council in Seattle, won transformative victories over the course of a decade. I worked in her council office for most of that time, when we passed the first-ever tax on Amazon to build social housing (beating Amazon’s capital strike threat), became first big city to win a $15-an-hour minimum wage (going in January to $21.30 an hour), strengthened renters’ rights, increased abortion and mental health care funding, banned caste discrimination, funded LGBTQ youth services, and more. Sawant won reelection three times, defeating the combined forces of the political establishment and Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft, Expedia, global financiers, and developers. We did not win by trying to change mainstream political parties from within or by playing by the establishment’s rules; we formed our own independent political movements, building power outside of and in opposition to other politicians. Our movement was led by Sawant, a Marxist, and the political organization she belonged to, Socialist Alternative. Sawant saw her political role as being a shop steward for the working class. She held herself accountable to people in the streets, not in the suites. Tracing Sawant’s 10 years on the Seattle City Council, my book details the theory and practice of what I call three pillars of Marxist insurgent struggle. Leah Abrams Jeet Heer Spencer Ackerman Gillian Branstetter First, we recognized that political struggle is class struggle. The people’s interests are fundamentally in conflict with the interests of big business and billionaires. We understood that socialists and our ideas were not welcome inside the halls of power, that political office did not provide some genteel space where earnest persuasion and lobbying could win the day. Rather, the state apparatus—the executive and legislative branches of governments, the bureaucracy, the courts, and the police, along with adjacent institutions including the media and mainstream political parties—upholds and reproduces the capitalist status quo. Rules like limits on local taxing authority are the political instruments through which economic elites maintain and reinforce their domination and control. That’s why we recognized that to achieve anything we had to reject a traditional political role and instead use our socialist office to build mass movements strong enough to force political concessions. Our second principle was advancing bold material demands, explicitly connected to the call for broader societal change. The demands that Mamdani has championed—a freeze on rent, taxes on the rich, fast and free buses—are good examples, though he should go even further. In Seattle, we saw how working people alienated by mainstream politics will get engaged when they see a movement that speaks to their material needs, explains the underlying problem, and provides a course of action. This helps explain why an astounding 90,000 people volunteered for Mamdani’s campaign. Bold demands also are important for us as socialists, because through the fight, we educate the broader community about capitalism’s inability to meet society’s basic needs. Demands and the campaigns for them can underscore why we must build movements not just for reform but for systemic change. We should push for a rent freeze, absolutely, but that should be a step toward kicking out big landlords to make housing a human right, not a commodity. The third principle that we practiced was popular democracy—the ongoing engagement of community members in setting demands and deciding strategy. Sawant and Socialist Alternative invited community members into forums where they would discuss and decide what demands to place before City Council and how to wage the fights. The $15 minimum wage and the Amazon tax strategies were developed through neighborhood and citywide meetings, culminating in mass meetings of hundreds of workers. We organized popular assemblies for tenants’ rights, LGBTQ rights, and a ceasefire in Gaza. We took over City Council meetings with hundreds of people. To put those three principles into action required an organization—and one that wasn’t the Democratic Party. During the 10 years that Sawant was in office, that organization was Socialist Alternative. The movement backing Sawant recognized that the 50-year neoliberal project is bipartisan. The federal minimum wage hasn’t budged in 16 years, even when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House. When Democrats held Congress, they failed to enshrine women’s reproductive rights or improve labor law. No matter which party is in power, military budgets soar, social benefits get cut, genocide and imperial wars carry on, and racist police killings continue. Today, 60 percent of Americans say that neither the Democrats nor Republicans represent them and that a new political party is needed. It’s been at that level for the last dozen years. Among adults under 50, support for a new party is even higher—70 percent. Many activists backing socialists and other progressives for office today want to believe that we can change the Democratic Party from within. For most of my life, I believed that, too. But we need to be clear-eyed about what the Democratic Party is. As Nancy Pelosi said in 2017, “We’re capitalist. And that’s just the way it is.” That’s why inside-the-party initiatives by democratic socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal—have languished in the Democrats’ legislative dungeon. You cannot build an anti-capitalist movement within a capitalist party, which is why it is a problem that Mamdani has adopted this same insider approach. To press the movement’s demands, like a rent freeze, universal affordable childcare, and fast and free buses, “New Yorkers will need to learn and organize independently of Mamdani, the Democratic mayor,” noted Hakan Yilmaz of the Tempest NYC Organizing Committee. If we were a union in a workplace following an election victory, we’d be recruiting to expand our organizing committees, department by department. We’d have an escalating plan of action—steps to build worker confidence and project our power. And we’d be building toward strike action, because ultimately to move the boss, you must be prepared to disrupt and shut down the business. Going up against today’s fusion of the billionaire class, government, and outright fascists, we must build movements along those same lines. Neighborhood committees—such as those developed during Mamdani’s campaign and those fighting ICE in Chicago, Los Angeles, and elsewhere—should become the building blocks for citywide movements. These city movements, in turn, combine to form the foundation of a national movement. As we build capacity and demand economic justice and civil liberty for all, we must develop escalating strategies that point toward disruption: strikes that create a political crisis for the elites and that build fortifications against Trump’s war on immigrants and other marginalized communities. One idea from activists is a mass petition in support of public services. Good, but only a start. We should think bigger: citywide marches on Inauguration Day that flood the streets with hundreds of thousands of workers taking the day off, occupations of state capitals like Albany until the politicians yield on local taxing authority, shutdowns of cities when Trump tries to send in his ICE thugs. Where we have the capacity, we should launch coordinated strikes and nonviolent civil disobedience. If this sounds like rule-breaking, it is; the rules are designed for workers to lose. The 2018 West Virginia educators strike was an illegal strike, and it ignited a national Red for Ed movement that inspired other law-breaking walkouts. Civil rights were won by defying racist laws. The 1930s New Deal advances came not through Franklin Roosevelt’s munificence but because of massive, disruptive workplace occupations, strikes, and marches. For a present-day example, look to the general strike just last month of 2 million Italian workers, who, defying threats of fines and criminal penalties, shut down the country in solidarity with the Gaza aid flotilla and forced the right-wing government of Giorgia Meloni to tighten weapons exports to Israel. Today, social movements in the United States lack the organizational strength, political acuity, and experience to mobilize that level of disruption. Union density, for example, is three times higher in Italy than it is in the United States, and the Italians have much more experience flexing the strike muscle. But that militancy exists within our collective past: Think of the civil rights movement that broke Jim Crow laws or the mass worker uprisings of the 1930s that won us Social Security, labor rights, minimum wages, and millions of public works jobs. We must forge ahead with urgency toward this ambitious vision. Seattle is not New York, but the principles of class struggle, bold demands, and popular democracy, backed by strong organization, are on the mark, because the underlying dynamics of political struggle are the same anywhere that capitalism rules. This week’s elections give left social movements tremendous momentum. But they also place us at a crossroads: If movements try once again to work within the political establishment, they will squander their energy. The movement behind Mamdani should strike out in a new, independent direction to give us a fighting chance against the billionaires and Trump. Jonathan Rosenblum, a union organizer and member of the National Writers Union, is author of We’re Coming For You And Your Rotten System: How Socialists Beat Amazon and Upended Big-City Politics (OR Books, October 2025).

Title: BlackRock Just Gave the XRP Community What It’s Been Waiting For

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byAnn Maria Shibu Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference in New York may have delivered one of the most defining moments in the digital asset industry’s relationship with Wall Street. The XRP community, in particular, got its long-awaited validation. During a keynote session, Maxwell Stein of BlackRock’s digital assets team told the audience that “the market is ready for large-scale blockchain adoption” and that infrastructure from Ripple could soon move trillions of dollars on-chain. Stein praised early industry builders like Ripple for proving blockchain’s real-world utility, not just as a speculative concept but as a functioning layer of financial infrastructure. “They’ve already tokenized fixed income, bonds, stablecoins… that’s where it started. But this is the rails for trillions in capital flows,” said Stein. A BlackRock executive publicly crediting Ripple for helping prove blockchain’s real-world functionality marked a milestone in the narrative XRP holders have championed for years. For a community that has long argued Ripple’s technology will underpin institutional liquidity, the comment landed like a thunderclap. For the longest time, the XRP community has clung to the belief that Ripple’s technology will serve as the bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized economy. Upon Stein’s statement, the XRP supporters across X (Twitter) saw the remark as long-awaited validation from the world’s largest asset manager. 🚨BREAKING: BlackRock Exec at Ripple Swell: “The Market Is Ready — Trillions Are Coming On-Chain” 💥This might’ve been the most electric moment of @Ripple Swell 2025.Maxwell Stein, a representative from @BlackRock, took the stage and straight-up said what everyone’s been… pic.twitter.com/OpuysMrq47 “We’ve seen what early adopters of crypto have done — they’ve shown us what’s possible. And now, the market is ready for broader adoption,” he added. His statement highlighted a shift in tone from TradFi, that blockchain is no longer an experiment. Rather, it is an emerging standard. However, the excitement that followed was tempered by legal caution. Australian lawyer and renowned XRP advocate Bill Morgan was among the first to raise questions about Stein’s remarks. He wondered whether they reflected an official BlackRock position or were simply Stein’s personal opinion. “Very interesting, but… was he speaking in a personal capacity or for BlackRock?” Morgan posted on X. The question resonated deeply because of what’s at stake. If Stein’s statement signals BlackRock’s strategic confidence in tokenized finance, it could mark one of the clearest indications yet that institutional adoption is imminent. If personal, it remains a powerful, but unofficial endorsement of Ripple and blockchain’s direction by extension. In the same event, Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman said the digital asset market is clearly maturing. However, she also acknowledged that regulatory clarity is essential for full-scale institutional participation. “To get them really engaged in the market, there has to be regulatory clarity,” she emphasized, noting that banks are already experimenting with tokenized bonds and stablecoin frameworks. Together, the remarks from Stein and Friedman painted a picture of convergence, where TradFi, blockchain, and regulation are aligning. Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference, once an industry event primarily for crypto insiders, became a stage where some of the most influential voices in global finance signaled readiness for integration. Despite these developments, along with the network’s growing institutional deals and exploding XRP adoption, the Ripple price remains lull. In the last 24 hours, the XRP price has been down by over 4%. It was trading for $2.21 as of this writing.

Title: The Vulnerability of Forests to Natural Disturbances

Time Published: 2025-11-07T09:54:24Z
Full Content:
Ministèrede l'Agriculture,de l'Agro-Alimentaireet de la Souverainetéalimentaire 07 novembre 2025 Info + Partager la page Sommaire The Analysis Notes present, in four pages, the main points of discussion on a current topic relevant to the areas of activity of the Department of Agriculture, Agri-Food, and Food Sovereignty. Depending on the topic, they take a forward-looking, strategic, or evaluative approach. Analysis n°224 Forests are increasingly threatened by natural disturbances, which are being exacerbated by climate change. This note explores the growing risks that will emerge in the future. It details several vulnerability factors and the associated environmental and economic impacts. In an uncertain context, understanding the interplay between the various components of risk makes it possible to prioritise actions that can mitigate it. Proactive management of forest fuel or the recovery of storm-damaged timber, for instance, are measures that can help address this challenge. Forests are affected by so-called “natural” disturbances, whether biotic (e.g. pathogens) or abiotic (e.g. fires). Their occurrence may nevertheless be of anthropogenic origin, as is the case for the majority of fires in France. Climate change intensifies these disturbances and places an increasing threat on the functions of forests: timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity reservoir, etc. The recent multiplication of extreme events, such as the fires in France during the summer of 2022 or the wildfire events that devastated forests in the Aude department in August 2025, has heightened the visibility of these disturbances in public debate. Awareness has also grown of their role in the decline of the land carbon sink1. The concepts associated with the notion of “risk” are numerous, each carrying a specific meaning. This note clarifies the constituent elements of the risks generated by natural disturbances in forests and illustrates them with concrete cases concerning Europe (including France) and the United States. The first part defines the components of risk (hazard, asset, vulnerability) and presents trends of the future evolution of hazards for the main disturbance agents. The second part reviews some of the environmental and economic consequences of current and future disturbances. Finally, examples of practices to reduce vulnerability through forest management or organisational solutions are described. Risk is a polysemous term, defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the potential for adverse consequences for a system to which certain values and objectives are attached2. It is a composite notion, resulting from the encounter of three components: a hazard, an element exposed to that hazard (or asset), and its vulnerability. The hazard corresponds to the physical phenomenon capable of causing harm. The notion covers both the characteristics of the event (e.g. wind speed, burnt area) and its probability of occurrence. Hazards that correspond to punctual events (e.g. fire, storm) cause catastrophic mortality, i.e. sudden and massive, in forest stands. Others have more diffuse impacts, such as droughts, which correspond to periods of thermal and/or rainfall anomalies compared to past references. The exposed element here is the forest ecosystem, which possesses use and non-use values for society and provides ecosystem services (e.g. timber production, landscape amenities). The asset corresponds to the proper ecosystem functioning of the forest. Independently of its degree of exposure, i.e. presence in a given area, a forest is characterised by a certain level of vulnerability, meaning a predisposition to being negatively impacted. It may be vulnerable due to its predisposition to damage (sensitivity) or its limited ability to adjust to and recover from damage (adaptive capacity). Figure 1 – Breakdown of the concept of risk Ce schéma montre que le risque émerge à l’intersection de trois notions : l’aléa, l’exposition et la vulnérabilité. This diagram visually represents that risk emerges at the intersection of three notions: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Reading: risk emerges from the encounter of a hazard that affects an exposed element characterised by a certain level of vulnerability. Source : IPCC, 2022, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Vulnerability may be intrinsic, linked to the physiological traits of trees, the composition and structure of stands, etc.3. For instance, some species are more resistant to fires due to thicker bark, or better adapted to rapid recovery, by resprouting (e.g. oaks) or via seed banks (e.g. Aleppo pine). Conversely, a forest with a high presence of fuel (e.g. dense understorey) is more prone to high-intensity fires. Forest vulnerability may also be extrinsic, linked to forest management, spatial planning, or land use. For example, the presence of roads makes forests more accessible for prevention and firefighting, but also more exposed to fire outbreaks caused by humans. Similarly, the existence of a monitoring system enables earlier detection of pathogen invasions. Climate change increases risk by worsening disturbance regimes (the hazard component), in other words by altering the frequency, intensity and seasonality of disturbance events and the areas they affect. These effects may be direct, for example when water stress due to lack of rainfall and longer, more intense periods of high temperatures weaken trees. They may also be indirect, particularly when new pathogens migrate and become viable (e.g. pine processionary caterpillar) or when endemic species enter epidemic phases (e.g. spruce bark beetle). Between the periods 1950–2000 and 2001–2019, damage caused by natural disturbances increased by 17% in Europe. Storms accounted for 46% of damage across both periods, followed by fires (24%), bark beetles (17%), other biotic agents (8%, e.g. diseases such as ash dieback and chestnut blight), and abiotic agents (8%, e.g. drought, snow). The increase in damage has been particularly marked in recent years for fires and bark beetles (Figure 2). The latter were responsible for 50% of the timber harvest in Germany in 2021. In France, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, 30,000 hectares of coniferous forests containing spruces (18% of the regional total) were destroyed or harvested between 2018 and 2022 due to bark beetle attacks. Since 2023, the crisis has affected all altitudinal levels of the Jura massif, including above 1,000 m4. Droughts, meanwhile, affected 0.5 million hectares of forests between 1987 and 2016 in Europe, and four of the five most severe events occurred after 20005. Figure 2 – Annual damage due to natural forest disturbances in Europe, 1950–2019 Ce graphique représente l’évolution des dommages en forêt causés par plusieurs catégories de perturbations naturelles, de 1950 à 2019. On voit que ceux-ci ont fortement augmenté au cours du temps. This graph shows the evolution of forest damage caused by several categories of natural disturbances, from 1950 to 2019. It illustrates the strong increase in damage over time. Source : Patacca M. et al. 2022, “Significant increase in natural disturbance impacts on European forests since 1950”, Global Change Biology Southern Europe could, during the 21st century, experience a 40 to 100% increase in annual burnt area. The fire season could lengthen by 20 days, and the probability of “megafires” increase tenfold6, 7. Temperate and boreal regions would also be affected, albeit to a lesser extent. In France, fire risk is expected to rise particularly sharply in the West and along the Mediterranean coastline8. For a +4 °C warming by the end of the century, the fire season would last 131 days and fires would affect 67% of the south-eastern quarter of the country, compared with 78 days and 28% at present9. Climate change accelerates the development cycle of pathogens and extends the areas favourable to them. The main epidemic currently underway is that of the spruce bark beetle. In western Europe, the damage it causes could be six times higher in 2021–2030 compared with 1971–201010. Storms are rare and complex events that are difficult to model. Climate change could increase wind speeds and make extreme events more common. In central Europe, a storm that is currently expected once a century could see its return period shortened to around 70 years by 210011. The different hazards interact with one another. For example, a forest damaged by a storm is more vulnerable to pathogens, and a drought increases the likelihood of fires. These interactions are expected to intensify under climate change, particularly with regard to biotic risks, making it necessary to adopt a “multi-hazard” perspective12. The occurrence of a hazard directly alters the structure and composition of the forest, as well as the ecosystem services it provides. In the short term, many trees may be destroyed or damaged, and biogeochemical cycles and habitats disrupted. The reorganisation phase that follows immediately after the hazard is crucial13, as it is when the communities that will make up the future forest establish themselves. Several outcomes are possible, ranging from full resilience (same composition and structure) to transition towards a non-forest state (in the case of major and/or repeated hazards), with intermediate states also possible. Biodiversity is affected through the impacts of disturbances on habitats. An affected area may see its species richness (number of species present) increase, decrease or remain stable14. This ambiguous relationship varies depending on the species and the dynamics of disturbances. Negative impacts often concern species that favour closed canopies (e.g. lichens), while others depend on disturbances to survive and establish themselves in open environments. The highest biodiversity levels, at landscape scale, are observed for disturbances of medium severity and size. Conversely, extreme events are generally harmful due to their tendency to homogenise habitats over large areas. The disappearance of a particular species may also be caused by certain hazards (e.g. pathogen affecting a specific tree species, such as ash dieback). A global meta-analysis has shown a negative impact of disturbances on most ecosystem services, particularly carbon sequestration. Soil quality and organic content, timber production and water quality are also affected15. Fires, for instance, increase soil erosion, reduce the recreational value of forests, and cause carbon emissions and release volatile compounds that can affect human health. According to a recent estimate, the three main disturbance agents in Europe (storms, fires, bark beetles) currently threaten the provision of forest ecosystem services by 10.4 to 12.3%. In total, 20 million hectares of forest (9.7% of the total area) would see their multifunctionality threatened, particularly in central and western Europe (Figure 3). Figure 3 – Areas affected by high risk of loss of forest ecosystem services in Europe Cette figure comporte des cartes qui montrent où sont situées, en Europe, les forêts dont les services écosystémiques sont le plus menacés par les perturbations naturelles. Les cartes concernent la production de bois, le stockage de carbone, la protection contre l’érosion et l’usage récréatif. This figure contains maps showing where, in Europe, forests have ecosystem services most threatened by natural disturbances. The maps relate to timber production, carbon storage, protection against erosion and recreational use. Reading: the coloured areas correspond to those most affected (beyond the 8th decile) by the risk to the ecosystem service considered. Other areas are also affected, but the level of risk is lower. Source : Lecina Diaz, J., et al., 2024, “Ecosystem services at risk from disturbance in Europe’s forests”, Global Change Biology Natural hazards pose risks to timber production and the wood industry. A major crisis, such as a storm, causes in the short term an influx of lower-quality timber on the market, reducing prices and disrupting trade16. Later, the damage causes a reduction in timber supply and pressure on prices (which rise), potentially lasting for several decades. In the Czech Republic, the 2018 bark beetle crisis caused an increase of 5.3 to 18 million m³ (+340%) in salvaged damaged timber compared with 2017, leading to a drop in timber prices from €55/m³ to €15/m³ (–73%)17. Disturbances also affect the value of forest land. For example, it decreased by an average of 10% between 1984–2003 and 2001–2020 in western US states, due to the multiplication of fires and droughts. Even unburnt areas are affected, to a lesser extent, through a change in risk perception by buyers18. Hazards also pose a risk of non-permanence for carbon stocks mobilised to mitigate climate change. In Europe, in the future, carbon losses linked to natural disturbances could be of the same order of magnitude as the gains expected from forest management aimed at mitigating climate change19. Due to the inherent uncertainty of meteorological phenomena, the forest carbon sink may vary greatly from year to year20. For example, Storm Vaia alone reduced Italy’s forest carbon sink by 4% in 201821. Recovering damaged timber for industry nevertheless makes it possible to transfer part of the carbon to downstream sectors, partially mitigating these consequences. The introduction of new pests could cause further degradation of the carbon sink. Seidl et al.22 estimate that 10% of European forest carbon would be exposed to five major new pests in Europe by 2080 under a high-warming scenario (RCP 8.5). An invasion by these pests would increase carbon losses due to natural hazards from +2.3% (for beech canker) to +50% (for the Asian longhorn beetle, which attacks several hardwood species). Beyond the direct mortality due to hazards, the decline of the carbon sink may also be attributed to the loss of photosynthetic activity by dying trees (Figure 4). Figure 4 – Breakdown of the decline of the French forest carbon sink between 2010 and 2020 Ce diagramme montre l’évolution du puits de carbone forestier en France de 2010 à 2020. On y voit que sa forte baisse est principalement due aux impacts du changement climatique, et notamment aux dépérissements dus aux perturbations naturelles. This diagram shows the evolution of the forest carbon sink in France from 2010 to 2020. It illustrates that its sharp decline is mainly due to the impacts of climate change, in particular dieback caused by natural disturbance. Source : Secrétariat général à la planification écologique, 2023 1 Direct action on hazards is often difficult, but risk can be reduced by lowering the vulnerability of exposed forests. Interventions are possible at different levels. Two examples are presented here: fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber. Many other measures, which we do not develop here, can also contribute to reducing vulnerability: diversification of forest composition and structure, enhanced monitoring, raising awareness among local stakeholders, etc. In forests, the presence of fuel in the understorey (e.g. low vegetation, branches) increases the risk of fire. It raises the probability of fire outbreaks and their ability to intensify and spread. When fuel is dry and continuous, the risk is even greater. Removing this vegetation preventively reduces forest vulnerability, particularly by lowering sensitivity, while also affecting the hazard component. This is, for example, the aim of the legal obligations for clearing undergrowth. These apply, in 43 French departments, to land located within 200 m of forest areas, within a radius of 50 m around buildings. These “wildland-urban” interface zones are particularly vulnerable, due to the high potential for fire outbreaks and the presence of buildings, people and economic activities. Similar measures exist elsewhere, for instance in Catalonia, Spain. In some regions, grazing is used to reduce fuel, through payments for environmental services23. A recent study assessed the impact of forest fuel management in California, where fires caused average annual damage estimated at $117 billion between 2017 and 202124. By 2050, the increase in fire intensity could be offset by the annual treatment of 240,000 hectares. The current target is to treat 400,000 hectares, which would avoid losses of $10.9 billion for an estimated annual cost of $3 billion, while each year of delay in achieving this target would lead to $4 billion in losses. However, according to the economists behind the study, the optimal area to treat to maximise benefits would be 1.6 million hectares per year, four times higher than the current target. Fuel can also be deliberately burnt preventively. Prescribed burning is a preventive measure that reduces the fuel load to prevent fire outbreaks. In France, it is planned by the State, local authorities or their representatives, and carried out by professionals. This practice also helps to maintain the good condition of certain ecosystems. Another solution, tactical fires and backfires, are firefighting techniques used during a blaze. They aim to channel the fire and support firefighting personnel. When storms occur, they generate a sudden influx of damaged timber. Recovering it enables owners to generate income, which is then reinvested in forest management. Being able to commercialise this “crisis timber” improves the adaptive capacity of forests. Conversely, leaving such timber on site increases the likelihood of another crisis (e.g. disease, fire outbreak), raising the sensitivity (and therefore vulnerability) of the stand to potential cascading hazards. Following a major crisis, wood recovery may be coordinated and supported by the State. It mainly involves two methods: storing timber for later processing locally; or exporting it to other regions25. These interventions help to ease pressure on local markets and smooth out negative economic impacts (e.g. price falls). First, an assessment of the damage must be carried out to prioritise operations. Rapid intervention is particularly necessary in the case of disease, to avoid its spread and timber degradation. During storage, timber health can be stabilised by treating it once removed from the forest (heat treatment, fumigation) and by ensuring proper storage conditions (ventilation, distance from forest, contact with the ground). A timber mobilisation plan was implemented in France following Storm Klaus (2009), which destroyed 42.5 million m³ of timber, mainly in the Aquitaine region. It included direct support for timber storage (creation and rehabilitation of storage areas) and transport outside the region, for a total of €126 million. Ultimately, 55% of the 29.5 million m³ of timber harvested post-storm benefited from direct aid. An economic model26 showed that this plan encouraged storage (+25%), accelerated and increased timber recovery (+33%), although it did not prevent the fall in prices (–60% for maritime pine). Over ten years, the plan is estimated to have generated an economic gain of €44 million for the forest-wood sector. An even more storage-focused strategy would have been more beneficial but would have slowed the recovery of prices, to the detriment of local producers. In the future, more damaged timber will be available due to the worsening of disturbance regimes. A recent foresight study27 emphasises the importance of anticipating this dynamic, not only for the economic aspects mentioned above, but also for maintaining the forest carbon sink. Upstream, it will be necessary to increase proactive harvesting of declining timber and prioritise it, in crisis years, over standard harvesting. Downstream, processing and storage capacities will need to be increased. Innovation will also be a key factor, in order to make better use of downgraded timber and, where possible, direct it towards long-life uses (e.g. construction), which are more beneficial from a climate perspective. The vulnerability of forests to natural disturbances, exacerbated by climate change, is a crucial issue for the management of forest ecosystems. This note has clarified the components of risk, distinguishing hazard, vulnerability and the assets associated with forests. Concrete examples show that forests are increasingly exposed to multiple hazards, particularly in Europe, with varied effects on ecosystem services, the forest economy and biodiversity. Adaptation strategies, such as fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber, can mitigate these impacts by reducing forest vulnerability. In the future, the development of a multi-hazard approach and proactive management practices will be crucial. To this end, it will be necessary to rely on clear conceptual frameworks in order to target the different components of risk appropriately. However, uncertainties remain about the complex interactions between the different hazards and the scale of future changes. Further research is needed to refine our knowledge, particularly regarding the impacts of extreme events. Other elements beyond forests are exposed, and potentially vulnerable, to the hazards discussed here. These include populations (fires can harm health through air pollution) and infrastructure (transport, housing, etc.). Any strategy for adapting to “forest” hazards must therefore be cross-sectoral and systemic, looking beyond the forest itself and considering these multiple components.

Title: There's no jobs report today, but here's what private data is telling us about the labor market

Every time Madison publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Economists, journalists, and investors won't be waiting by their laptops this morning for a new jobs report. It's the second month without this data release. The agency isn't releasing most reports or collecting data during the government shutdown, which is the longest one in US history. However, job seekers, economists, and anyone else missing the BLS reports can turn to recent publications from ADP, Indeed, Bank of America, and others to get a sense of how the job market and broader economy are doing. The analyses showed that October was still a tough month for job seekers. Announced job cuts climbed based on a report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas; demand cooled to a level not seen in years based on job postings on Indeed; and various reports together show a soft job market. Allison Shrivastava, an economist with the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider it's lucky that there are a lot of private sector data releases to "piece together a picture of what's going on in the economy." However, she added that even those alternative sources often rely on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calibrate their work, so without it, job-market clarity is muddied. Here's what recent releases said about October's job market. Based on ADP payroll data, the US added 42,000 private sector jobs in October after falling in the previous two months. Despite beating the 32,000 consensus, Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP, said in the news release that hiring was modest. Most of the net growth came from large companies that have at least 500 employees. Job growth was mixed by industry. Trade, transportation, and utilities together added 47,000 jobs. Employment dipped in information, manufacturing, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality. Bill Adams, the chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in commentary that the federal layoffs — which aren't included in the ADP national employment report — would pretty much cancel out the private employment growth in October. Many government workers aren't working during the government shutdown and are missing pay. Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that announced job cuts from US-based employers skyrocketed over the month to the highest October total since 2003 — increasing from 54,064 to 153,074 this past October. Last month's gain means over 1 million announced cuts so far this year, more than the roughly 761,000 cuts for the entire previous year. "Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes," Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer, said in the report. Ernie Tedeschi, a nonresident senior fellow at The Budget Lab at Yale, recently told Business Insider that companies like Amazon, which announced a reduction of 14,000 corporate workers, are likely correcting for overhiring during the pandemic-era and Great Resignation. Shrivastava told Business Insider the US is in a precarious, not dangerous situation based on the platform's data. Job postings trended downward last month, hitting the lowest point since 2021. "Things have been kind of eroding slowly," Shrivastava said. "Not a lot of job growth added, still really difficult to break into the labor market, people still really holding onto their jobs." It's not just employees sitting still; Shrivastava said employers have mainly been holding onto workers. Despite new cuts making news, BLS data up to August showed US layoff rates have been low for years — the 2021 to 2025 average of 1.0% is a hair below the 2015 to 2019 average of 1.2%. Shrivastava said a surge in layoffs would "be kind of the thing that tips the tower over." Kory Kantenga, the head of economics for the Americas at LinkedIn, said in a post that October hiring wasn't too far off from September, although it did fall 0.8% and down from the start of the year. The number of job openings per applicant has also been cooling, and dropped 1% over the month. Kantenga said in the post that both supply and demand have dropped. "The job market has been running slow, it's continuing to run slow," Kantenga told Business Insider. "There just isn't a lot of momentum across the board." Kantenga told Business Insider that job seekers need to be open to industries that are still hiring, such as healthcare and construction. "There are areas where things have actually started to turn around, but they're not yet where they need to be for there to be a lot of opportunities," Kantenga said. "Technology, information, and media is one." The Bank of America Institute said there was "​​no significant further slowdown in the labor market" last month based on internal data on how many of the bank's customers are getting paychecks. "While this data does suggest a slowdown in jobs growth has taken place since the summer, it tends to suggest that for now at least, there is no further deceleration," the new report said. Unemployment payments were up from a year ago, but the report said the growth rate cooled slightly from September. Across the board, households had higher pay than a year ago, but higher-income households had the highest rise. Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small businesses, found that the hiring rate and quits rate at those businesses cooled in October. Net hires at small businesses also fell by 5,900, the first drop since January. Average hourly earnings are also up a little bit from a year ago. "We're witnessing a significant shift in small business hiring patterns," Andrew Chamberlain, the principal economist at Gusto, said, adding there's essentially no job growth happening compared to the growth during the post-pandemic recovery. "The culprits are clear: persistently high borrowing costs that keep business loans at 7-15%, ongoing tariff uncertainty that makes planning nearly impossible, and elevated operating expenses across the board," he said. More rate cuts could help business owners. The Fed cut rates in September and October after holding rates steady throughout 2025. Chamberlain said Gusto expects a rebound "as the Fed starts to relax interest rates in the coming year." Jump to

Title: Bitcoin ETFs snap six-day outflow streak with $240M inflows

Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $240 million in inflows after six straight days of outflows, signaling a renewed wave of institutional demand for BTC. Update Nov. 7, 1:53 pm UTC: This article has been updated to add a Twitter post from Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a $239.9 million net inflow on Thursday, ending a six-day slump of outflows draining almost $1.4 billion from the market. According to data from Farside Investors, the reversal came after a turbulent week of profit-taking driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, which led to redemptions across the largest institutional Bitcoin (BTC) investment vehicles. The rebound was led by asset manager BlackRock, which added $112.4 million to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $61.6 million. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) reported $60.4 million, while Grayscale's GBTC, which had experienced consistent outflows since mid-October, showed no change. In total, the six-day sell-off marked one of the steepest pullbacks since the ETFs started trading in January. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a Friday X post that despite a 20% market drawdown, US Bitcoin ETFs saw less than $1 billion in total outflows, which means 99.5% of assets remain invested. Balchunas said that even after the correction, ETF investors “hung tough,” highlighting the staying power of long-term holders. He added that the strong retention rate suggests the selling pressure didn’t come from outside investors, but rather “from inside the house.” Similar to spot Bitcoin ETFs, the exchange-traded products tracking Ether (ETH) also saw a six-day outflow streak on a smaller scale. According to SoSoValue, spot ETH ETFs had a six-day sell-off, resulting in about $837 million being withdrawn from the ETH-based crypto investment products. This was finally reversed on Thursday, when spot Ether ETFs saw small gains of $12.51 million. Spot Solana (SOL) ETFs have performed well since their launch on Oct. 28. SoSoValue data shows that SOL-based products have seen $322 million in inflows since their launch and haven’t had a day of net outflows. Related: Bitcoin bulls retreat as spot BTC ETF outflows deepen and macro fears grow On Thursday, crypto market maker Wintermute assigned ETFs as one of the three key pillars of liquidity for the crypto sector. In a blog post, Wintermute said that liquidity remains the key driving force behind every crypto cycle, arguing that it has a greater impact than technological developments. Wintermute said that stablecoins, ETFs and digital asset treasuries were the three major pillars for crypto liquidity, and pointed out that liquidity inflows in all three sectors have reached a plateau.

Title: Robinhood’s Crypto Revenue Miss Tempers Solid Quarter: JPMorgan

Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) called Robinhood’s (HOOD) third-quarter results solid but lower quality, as weaker crypto revenue and tax benefits drove much of the earnings beat. The bank said the roughly 15% earnings per share (EPS) beat was mostly due to a lower tax rate tied to stock-based compensation from the 52% rise in the share price, in a report published Thursday. Analysts led by Kenneth Worthington expect the trading platform's margins to keep improving and raised their price target on the shares to $130 from $122, while reiterating their neutral rating on the stock. The shares slumped 11% yesterday, closing around $127. Crypto was the main drag, with net revenue of $268 million missing both Street and JPMorgan estimates, sending shares lower despite strong volume growth. The bank said Robinhood’s crypto fee rate slipped to 67 basis points from an expected 68, as management continues to adjust pricing. Prediction markets offset some weakness, though the analysts cautioned that the segment depends on a small group of active traders.

Title: Vodafone and AST SpaceMobile Announce New EU Satellite Constellation and Select Germany for European Sovereign Satellite Operations Centre

Time Published: 2025-11-07T07:00:00Z
Full Content:
November 07, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: Vodafone Group PLC Vodafone Group PLC London London LONDON, Nov. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vodafone Group and AST SpaceMobile Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) have selected Germany as the location for their main Satellite Operations Centre. The centre will allocate, and map satellite connectivity used by SatCo to serve mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe to ensure ubiquitous mobile broadband in underserved areas and support emergency services and disaster relief agencies. It will be located near either Munich or Hannover, depending on final negotiations with all relevant parties. AST SpaceMobile is building the first and only space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by everyday smartphones, designed for both commercial and government applications. SatCo aims to provide a scalable European satellite mobile broadband service for use by MNOs to benefit all European citizens, businesses and public sector organisations. MNOs in 21 European Union (EU) member states and other European countries have expressed interest in adopting the service, with commercial launch planned to commence from 2026. The planned EU constellation will include a comprehensive ‘command switch’ feature to support European oversight and security. This capability supports updating all telemetry, tracking, and control (TTC) encryption keys for both S-Band (used to connect smartphones from space) and Q/V-Band (used for links between satellites and earth stations). It also allows for the modification of service encryption keys for communications across the continent, as well as manages the activation, deactivation, and direction of satellite beams in Europe. In addition to commercial mobile broadband, the constellation will support public protection and disaster relief efforts (PPDR). It does this by providing reliable, broadband-speed connectivity from space directly to the everyday smartphones and other cellular devices of emergency responders, even in the most dangerous and challenging environments. Margherita Della Valle, CEO of Vodafone, said: “SatCo delivers a sovereign satellite solution to the whole of Europe. It will give European operators access to secure and resilient satellite communications, complementing existing terrestrial telecommunications networks. By establishing a satellite constellation in the EU and our principal command centre in Germany, we are ensuring the next frontier of communications infrastructure is firmly embedded in Europe.” “Together with Vodafone, we are accelerating the arrival of true mobile broadband from space across Europe,” said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. “Germany’s Operations Centre will be the operations hub for our BlueBird constellation in Europe, enabling us to serve millions of users. Alongside our gateways, we are building a robust, secure infrastructure that ensures Europe stays connected with seamless mobile broadband, always.” The planned satellite constellation can also contribute to the development of a pan-European mobile broadband system, enhancing the communication and coordination of emergency services during crises and disasters, in line with the EU Critical Communication System (EUCCS) vision. In particular, the satellites will support frequency bands that are suitable for PPDR radio communications, subject to national decisions and deployment choices. While many functions are automated, specialist engineers at the Operations Centre will monitor and respond to extraterrestrial events such as solar flares, as well as manage issues that arise on Earth. It will also house one of a network of SatCo ground-based gateway stations across Europe. These gateways provide secure backhaul links between the satellite constellation and terrestrial 4G/5G networks, enabling users to switch automatically between space-based and land-based coverage for uninterrupted, resilient connectivity. AST SpaceMobile has submitted through Germany the appropriate filings with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialised agency of the United Nations. This will help manage and mitigate any signal interference and ensure the smooth integration with existing mobile telecoms networks. Germany’s strategically central location provides SatCo with the ideal foundation to complement terrestrial networks, supporting the need to keep users across Europe remain securely connected anytime, anywhere. In addition to providing service to all EU MNOs using their national spectrum bands, SatCo is a candidate for access to the EU 2GHz Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) spectrum. If secured, this would enable existing MNOs to distribute a fully pan-European, sovereign, space-based broadband service directly to their customers. The aforementioned PPDR frequency bands (698–703/753–758 MHz and 733–736/788–791 MHz) would be used to support this capability.

Postproduction studios The Yard and One of Us herald growing maturity, resilience in French VFX sector By Ben Croll France’s vibrant VFX sector now stands at the forefront of the country’s broader push to strengthen its global production appeal, reflecting a national strategy that has championed the craft ever since the 2020 revision of the Tax Rebate for International Production (TRIP). That update introduced a 10% bonus on all eligible expenses for productions spending over $2.3 million with local VFX houses. Five years on, the incentive has proven transformative, driving studio expansion, nurturing talent and attracting a steady stream of high-profile international projects to French soil. Related Stories Colin Farrell Says Tom Cruise 'Was Not Happy' on 'Minority Report' Set After Farrell Drank Before Filming and Needed to Do 46 Takes of One Scene: 'It Went Terrible' Charlie Sheen Says Tom Cruise's 'Born on the Fourth of July' Casting Was a 'Betrayal' by Oliver Stone, but 'I'm Not Going to Talk S--- About' Cruise: 'He Should've Won the Oscar' Today, the sector has reached maturity — and with maturity comes resilience. The unexpected collapse of Technicolor triggered layoffs and production disruptions, while a broader post-pandemic slowdown has seen commissions drop nearly 30%. With AI disruption and studio consolidation looming, growth increasingly depends on adaptability. Popular on Variety “Flexibility, agility and teamwork define the new business model,” says the Yard founder and CEO Laurens Ehrmann. “Our midsize structure offers a real advantage. Clients know their projects matter, that they’ll get an A-team, and that we’ll always respond quickly.” With outposts in Paris, Montpellier and now London — a move to access multiple tax credits while staying close to partners like Amazon and Netflix — the Yard has tied its expansion directly to relationship management. Case in point: after working on 2019’s “Ford v Ferrari,” the Yard maintained strong ties with the project’s VFX supervisor, who later entrusted them with advanced creature work on this year’s “Predator: Badlands.” Tasked with a milestone sequence, the studio built an animation, character, creature and digidouble pipeline from scratch, handling 120 complex shots and creating a robust toolset for future creature FX. “Working on creatures is one of the most complex parts of VFX,” Ehrmann explains. “Mastering it allows you to bid on entire sequences with vast environments and complex characters, now positioning us as a tier-one VFX company.” Executives from VFX studio One of Us describe their work on 2024’s “Damsel” as similarly transformative. The studio delivered over 400 shots, including 250 featuring a fully realized, emotive dragon, with the rest dedicated to large-scale destruction and fully 3D environments. Splitting the work between outposts in London and Paris, the studio’s teams collaborated seamlessly, emerging from this trial-by-fire with cost-saving insights. “Getting involved early is critical,” says Emmanuel Pichereau, CCO of One of Us. “It allows us to plan strategically, reduce shot counts, control costs and, most importantly, align with the film’s storytelling from the very beginning when changes are still flexible.” The studio is applying this philosophy to upcoming projects like “The Bride!” and “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man.” For both, the team is working from its Paris office to qualify for the full French tax rebate, crafting visual effects designed to be seamless rather than showy. “We want to blend into these worlds,” says CEO Rachael Penfold. “We’re there to serve the story and realize the filmmakers’ vision, not to show off. The best visual effect is often the one you never notice.” But Penfold is happy to tout the French value proposition — and she recently traveled to Los Angeles to championed Gallic talent at industry sessions and case studies. “The French film industry is mature, and its talent is often immersed in a culture of great filmmaking, not just trained on specific software,” Penfold says. “The emphasis is cultural — it’s about artistic problem-solving and craftsmanship. While some focus on technical details, French artists tend to take a more holistic, well-rounded view. That mindset brings added value to every project.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Shayne Bolton takes the Mack Hansen route through the Ireland pecking order

Full Content:
As a 17-year-old, Shayne Bolton had a choice to make. A talented all-round sportsman in his school days, he had to pick between rugby and golf. He already had his handicap down to scratch at the time and was considered to be very talented in both. Unsurprisingly for a young South African, Bolton chose rugby before he had to make another choice four years later. Born and reared in Pretoria and schooled in the Hoërskool Eldoraigne, an Afrikaans co-ed in the Gauteng province, Bolton played for the Blue Bulls and was then given a two-year contract with the Cheetahs academy. On its completion, however, his deal was not extended. Playing University rugby but without any apparent future in South African rugby, Connacht became aware that Bolton had an Irish grandmother, Noirín Stapleton from Blackrock in Dublin. The player was highly recommended by the province’s contacts. Many gems can easily slip through the net in South African rugby before being polished elsewhere. Bolton’s adaptation to his new life and career in Galway and Connacht weren’t helped by a succession of niggly soft-tissue injuries. He started just 10 games in his first three seasons, but the work with the Connacht strength and conditioning team paid off last season, when he started a dozen games and scored six tries. At the midway point in a World Cup cycle, Bolton’s profile is not hugely dissimilar that of Mack Hansen four years ago; an uncapped Connacht winger from the southern hemisphere with Irish roots who had previously played centre or fullback (Hansen having also played at outhalf). Granted, they’re very different types of players. Hansen is more of a multi-faceted playmaking winger with x-factor. Bolton has been successfully converted into a more straight-running, strong, powerful, quick winger. Though not the tallest, he is good in the air and has an eye for the try line. He is clearly on Andy Farrell’s radar. Bolton scored two tries on his Irish debut in the 106-7 win over Portugal in the summer and was then brought to Chicago to train with the senior squad for two weeks. “I think the preparation is almost more important than the game itself,” says Bolton. “Obviously, we’ve lots of new detail or moves and stuff in the week before the game. Usually with the provinces, all your calls are kind of the same consistently throughout the year, whereas we just have a week now to get that detail, all the moves sorted, how you execute that on the pitch.” Learning and executing details quickly is part of the challenge. “I remember my first time coming in, [my] head was absolutely fried. So many new things to learn. I think it just comes with time, over the weeks you learn, you try and be around the boys a lot, trying to pick up on little small cues in language or language between the boys. “I feel way more comfortable over the last couple of weeks. I know almost everyone now,” says Bolton, who admits he was “very nervous the first time I came in, just trying to be quiet and kind of sneak behind the radar. But now I’m bringing out my personality a bit more”. Does having Blackrock origins earn him kudos with some of his squadmates? “They don’t believe me when I say my family’s from Blackrock,” says Bolton laughing. This week he has been re-routed to Leganés, where he will be part of the Ireland XV team to face Spain on Saturday, (kick-off 5pm local time/4pm Irish time, live on rugbypass). “They’ve qualified for the World Cup,” Bolton notes. “They’re a very good team. It’s going to be a big game. I think it’s going to be very physical. And hopefully we can leave our mark on it.” If Bolton does, it will be another upward step in his Irish graph. “The weather is a challenge,” he says of living in Galway, but “great city to live, class, nothing to complain about”. His family are aboard the journey too. His parents and grandfather all wore Connacht jerseys at the Bulls game in Pretoria two years ago, and his parents have been over to Galway, as well as one of his brothers. His grandmother is “very proud“, he says, smiling. “Sending me messages every game week.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Tech layoffs surge to 33,281 in October as AI and economic fears trigger historic job cuts

U.S. employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October, the highest for that month in more than two decades.

The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with job cuts up 145% this year. The American dream is unraveling for hundreds of thousands of workers as a tidal wave of corporate layoffs crashes through the economy. A disappointing new report for October reveals the highest level of job cuts for that month in more than two decades, shattering the illusion of a stable recovery and exposing a labor market in deep distress. The tech sector, once a bastion of high-paying jobs, is leading the charge in this devastating downturn, leaving seasoned professionals struggling to afford basic necessities in an economy that appears to be turning against them. According to the latest data from executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, U.S. employers axed 153,074 jobs in October alone. This represents a staggering 183% increase from September and is the worst October for layoffs since 2003. The total number of job cuts for 2025 has now soared past 1.09 million, reaching its highest level since the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns of 2020. A tech industry in retreat The technology industry is experiencing a brutal correction. Tech companies announced 33,281 layoffs in October, a dramatic surge from the 5,639 cuts reported in September. So far this year, the tech sector has announced 141,159 job cuts, a 17% increase from the 120,470 cuts during the same period in 2024. This data confirms that the mass layoffs that began at giants like Microsoft and Amazon in recent years have evolved into a full-blown industry-wide crisis. The drivers behind this historic downsizing are a toxic cocktail of economic pressures and technological disruption. Andy Challenger, the companyâs workplace expert and chief revenue officer, explained the confluence of factors in the report. âSome industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,â he said. This sentiment echoes past justifications from corporate leaders, such as Amazonâs Andy Jassy, who previously stated that layoffs would help pursue âlong-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.â The human cost of business efficiency The human cost of this corporate âbelt-tighteningâ is immense. The report delivers a chilling finding for those who have lost their jobs: âthose laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.â This is a devastating blow to white-collar professionals who once enjoyed high demand for their skills. The report notes that many are now struggling to afford food, gas, and housing, with some former tech recruiters resorting to exhausting retail and catering jobs just to survive. While companies often cite artificial intelligence as a key reason for cuts, some experts question if AI is being used as a convenient scapegoat. Companies explicitly blamed AI for 31,039 of the October layoffs, making it the second-most cited reason after general cost-cutting. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School, suggested some firms could be âAI-washingâ their job cuts. âWe spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and thereâs very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that weâre talking about,â Cappelli noted. The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, a 145% increase from 2024. This aligns with the struggles of companies like Target, which is facing a severe shoplifting crisis that its chief financial officer at the time, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, said is projected to decrease gross margin by more than $600 million for the entire year. The broader economic landscape is one of weakening consumer spending and rising costs, forcing corporations to shrink their workforces. The pain is not confined to one industry. Major household names are making deep cuts. Amazon recently announced it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles. Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs in its first major layoff in a decade. UPS is laying off 48,000 workers as it adjusts to lower shipping volumes. This widespread retrenchment signals a fundamental shift in corporate Americaâs appetite for labor. Making matters worse, hiring plans have slowed to a crawl. Employers have announced just 488,077 planned hires through October, the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal holiday hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the data. The opportunities for displaced workers to find new positions are rapidly vanishing. As we head into an uncertain future, the report offers little hope for a quick turnaround. âAt this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025,â Challenger concluded. The data paints a clear and unsettling picture: the era of easy opportunity and job security that defined the last decade is over, replaced by a new reality of automation, economic anxiety, and a struggle for survival for the American worker. The corporate pursuit of efficiency has a real and human price, and it is being paid by the hundreds of thousands now cast out of the workforce.

So far this year, the tech sector has announced 141,159 job cuts, a 17% increase from the 120,470 cuts during the same period in 2024. This data confirms that the mass layoffs that began at giants like Microsoft and Amazon in recent years have evolved into a full-blown industry-wide crisis. The drivers behind this historic downsizing are a toxic cocktail of economic pressures and technological disruption. Andy Challenger, the companyâs workplace expert and chief revenue officer, explained the confluence of factors in the report. âSome industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,â he said. This sentiment echoes past justifications from corporate leaders, such as Amazonâs Andy Jassy, who previously stated that layoffs would help pursue âlong-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.â The human cost of business efficiency The human cost of this corporate âbelt-tighteningâ is immense. The report delivers a chilling finding for those who have lost their jobs: âthose laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.â This is a devastating blow to white-collar professionals who once enjoyed high demand for their skills. The report notes that many are now struggling to afford food, gas, and housing, with some former tech recruiters resorting to exhausting retail and catering jobs just to survive. While companies often cite artificial intelligence as a key reason for cuts, some experts question if AI is being used as a convenient scapegoat. Companies explicitly blamed AI for 31,039 of the October layoffs, making it the second-most cited reason after general cost-cutting. Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School, suggested some firms could be âAI-washingâ their job cuts. âWe spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and thereâs very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that weâre talking about,â Cappelli noted. The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, a 145% increase from 2024. This aligns with the struggles of companies like Target, which is facing a severe shoplifting crisis that its chief financial officer at the time, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, said is projected to decrease gross margin by more than $600 million for the entire year. The broader economic landscape is one of weakening consumer spending and rising costs, forcing corporations to shrink their workforces. The pain is not confined to one industry. Major household names are making deep cuts. Amazon recently announced it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles. Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs in its first major layoff in a decade. UPS is laying off 48,000 workers as it adjusts to lower shipping volumes. This widespread retrenchment signals a fundamental shift in corporate Americaâs appetite for labor. Making matters worse, hiring plans have slowed to a crawl. Employers have announced just 488,077 planned hires through October, the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal holiday hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the data. The opportunities for displaced workers to find new positions are rapidly vanishing. As we head into an uncertain future, the report offers little hope for a quick turnaround. âAt this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025,â Challenger concluded. The data paints a clear and unsettling picture: the era of easy opportunity and job security that defined the last decade is over, replaced by a new reality of automation, economic anxiety, and a struggle for survival for the American worker. The corporate pursuit of efficiency has a real and human price, and it is being paid by the hundreds of thousands now cast out of the workforce.

This represents a staggering 183% increase from September and is the worst October for layoffs since 2003.

The retail sector is also under severe pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, a 145% increase from 2024. This aligns with the struggles of companies like Target, which is facing a severe shoplifting crisis that its chief financial officer at the time, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, said is projected to decrease gross margin by more than $600 million for the entire year. The broader economic landscape is one of weakening consumer spending and rising costs, forcing corporations to shrink their workforces. The pain is not confined to one industry. Major household names are making deep cuts. Amazon recently announced it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles. Target is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs in its first major layoff in a decade. UPS is laying off 48,000 workers as it adjusts to lower shipping volumes. This widespread retrenchment signals a fundamental shift in corporate Americaâs appetite for labor. Making matters worse, hiring plans have slowed to a crawl. Employers have announced just 488,077 planned hires through October, the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal holiday hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the data. The opportunities for displaced workers to find new positions are rapidly vanishing. As we head into an uncertain future, the report offers little hope for a quick turnaround. âAt this point, we do not expect a strong seasonal hiring environment in 2025,â Challenger concluded. The data paints a clear and unsettling picture: the era of easy opportunity and job security that defined the last decade is over, replaced by a new reality of automation, economic anxiety, and a struggle for survival for the American worker. The corporate pursuit of efficiency has a real and human price, and it is being paid by the hundreds of thousands now cast out of the workforce.

Now she’s ready to move into the ‘new old’ home next door. Grief psychotherapist Liz Gleeson and her family bought their 1879-built home in the seaside town back in 2007 after it had been used for decades as a local dentist’s surgery. The exterior of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow As one of the larger homes in a terrace at Church Road, she believes the property was originally constructed by the Evans family and that after it was completed, two of the builder brothers occupied homes in the terrace themselves – one taking Springmount, the better of the two. “Originally Springmount came with a cottage attached to its grounds as well as an outdoor dairy,” says Gleeson, who is from Blackrock, Co Dublin. These were eventually sold off separately, leaving a large tranch of garden ground at the side of the Gleeson’s home. “The house was in good condition but a lot of its original features had been taken away or altered over the years. We set out to bring it back by replacing and changing out those features that weren’t period correct with originals that we sourced elsewhere.” A big benefit was the presence of the original elaborate marble chimney piece in the front reception. But others had been removed over the years. “And the shutter and sash windows were mostly intact, although sealed up with decades of paint. Once we stripped that back and freed them up, we were delighted to discover that they all worked perfectly. We had to replace a few weights for the sash windows but that wasn’t really a problem. The front room of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow “In the beginning we spent three to four months stripping out fake panelling that had been added at some point, along with filling skips with the old carpets. When we acquired it, I had a two-year-old and our second child had just been born, so we had a lot going on.” The restoration process saw the family scouring markets and antiques dealers and even ditches for period authentic replacement parts and furniture. “One of the period fireplace pieces that we installed we found in a hedge in Maynooth, all covered in rust. We had it cleaned up and replaced the missing tiles with original Victorian hand painted versions we got in salvage. The kitchen of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow “Upstairs, it looked like previous owners had tried to make a self-contained bedsit, and we brought that room back,” says Gleeson. “The stairs’ bannisters had been panelled over and when we removed these we discovered that many of the spindles had also been removed. As an engineer, my father took a spindle away and had identical new replacements made to fill all the gaps. So we eventually got the stairs back looking the way it should.” Since then four Gleeson children have grown up here. “One day I was sitting out in the garden thinking: ‘I could really build a decent sized granny flat here.’ After a time, the idea grew into a full-sized home. So an architect’s firm was engaged and they came up with a contemporary box that never would have gotten planning permission. The bathroom of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow “While I really didn’t want a pastiche, the planners were unlikely to allow something that looked out of place. So I realised we’d have to come up with something that fitted in so well you’d think it was always there.” So ironically, having spent years bringing a modernised period home back to its authentic self, the family now set about building an identical modern home next door which would be as authentically historic as possible. A mirror image of their home in every way. Liz Gleeson. Photo: Bryan Meade However, the family went all out to such a degree that even the windows in the new house were perfectly recreated sash windows, made the same way with weights and pulleys while the front door was hand made as a genuine panel version. “Once we sat down with the planners and explained what we wanted to do, they were very reasonable. All in all, it took three years from planning to completion, which wasn’t at all bad. Mark Smith, our builder, was excellent. He really got into it. We had a newly carved panel door made and got all the brass for it,” says Gleeson. The dining area of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow Today, this looks absolutely identical to the original on Springmount House. “My daughter found enough original Victorian blue banger slates from a source in Kilkenny.” They even replicated the two storey bay window column and door fanlight in the frontage of Springmount. The house was finished in 2023. A bedroom in Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow Now Liz is moving from her authenticated period home into the identical ‘new’ period authentic home next door. And Springmount is being put up for sale: “Much as I don’t want to sell, I really don’t have use for two houses.” The double fronted 2,315 sq ft home includes a big hall, front sitting room; with original marble chimney piece, a drawing room faces the front garden and includes a period tiled chimney piece. Down a half flight of stairs is the kitchen which opens into a dining room with two skylights overhead and a large window into the garden. The entrance hall of Springmount House, Church Road, Greystones, Co Wicklow There’s a dedicated office / study, a utility room, shower room and guest WC on the ground floor. Upstairs there are five bedrooms, one with a walk in dressing room and two full bathrooms. The back rooms have sea views to Bray Head and Howth. “It’s been a fabulous family home and we’ve had christenings, Halloween parties, weddings, Christmas parties. It’s a great house for entertaining. And when I walk out the door I can walk down for my morning swim in the sea in minutes, there’s a sauna three minutes down the road and I can be out on the cliff walks or hop in the car and be in the hills and woodlands around Greystones in no time at all,” says Gleeson. Another advantage for a buyer is that they’ll know who their neighbours are. Sherry FitzGerald seeks €1.2m.

It has been another tough year for restaurants. The closure of Dylan McGrath’s trio, followed by Big Mike’s, underlines how hard it is for independents to hold their ground while big operators and investment funds circle and move in. The good news is that plenty of independents remain, and that’s our focus with this winter list. We’re celebrating the stalwarts who’ve been doing it right for years alongside the new entrants reshaping the dining scene. The list spans casual and buzzy spots, special-occasion rooms, and high-end restaurants that don’t trap you in a tasting menu. Some destinations may raise an eyebrow on price, but set against a weekend abroad, they more than hold their own. Of course, there are more than 100 amazing restaurants in Ireland. These are the ones run with an ethos worth backing – chefs who source quality Irish produce, who lead with integrity and imagination, and who prove that good food and social conscience can go hand in hand. They are the restaurants that remind us why, even in a difficult year, Ireland is still one of the most exciting places to eat. In solidarity with the indies, Corinna, Joanne and Ali. Brazilian chef Viktor Silva brings serious ambition to Harry Street with a €79 tasting menu that feels both creative and generous. The room is elegant – parquet floors, marble bar, high sash windows – and the cooking has flair. Goat’s cheese with okra, strawberry and a clear watermelon consommé is the star on a menu that threads Brazilian ideas throughout, from moqueca-style monkfish to foie gras with coffee. Amai is bold, stylish and one of Dublin’s most exciting new restaurants. Read our review here. Corinna Hardgrave When Argentinian Florencia Matan opened the original Bakeology, it quickly became known for its delicious alfajores filled with dulce de leche and savoury empanadas. Now there’s a second location right across the street, the bright and cheerful brunch-focused Bakeology In. Try the signature Wild Green medialuna, a croissant-like pastry filled with spinach cream, goat’s cheese, honey and walnuts, or the Tango Scramble with avocado sauce and sriracha mayo. Joanne Cronin Located in a formerly vacant warehouse tucked away in the Cathedral Quarter, Lottie Noren’s all-day menu of European small plates has been the recent talk of Belfast. This young chef adeptly combines her experience from across the UK and her time competing for the North on BBC’s Great British Menu. Share plates of beef tartare with beef fat focaccia, lamb rib with hung yoghurt or pressed potato with guanciale cream in a warm and comfortable setting. JC The dream team of Sean Crescenzi and Jamie McCarthy have brought a true taste of Italy to Phibsborough, with a menu running from spuntini and pizzette to house-made pasta and wood-fired mains. If Borgo served nothing but its gambas – prawns seared in lemon, garlic and chilli butter – it would still be worth the trip. It’s that rare restaurant that feels equally right for a quick bite or a long night. Read our review here. CH Lucie and Carlos Capparelli have transformed a restored mill, 20 minutes outside Belfast, into a striking diningroom of glass and wild-flower views. Brazilian-born Carlos spent nine years cooking with Yotam Ottolenghi, who is also a backer of their business. The Italian-influenced menu includes small plates, pasta, mains and rotisserie. Aubergine with goat’s milk yoghurt, beef ragù, and aubergine pasta all impress, and the rotisserie chicken is spectacular. Read our review here. CH Slow-cooked and smoked meats take centre stage at Chubbys, no surprise to fans of chef Barry Stephen’s former 147 Deli and Just Chubbys tacos. The former taco truck’s warehouse is now a snazzy sit-down spot worthy of its big, bold menu, with dishes such as 10-hour smoked short ribs, birria tacos and fried chicken that turn heads as they leave the kitchen. Good beer, wines and zingy cocktails round it all out. Ali Dunworth The quail at Comet tells you everything – deboned, stuffed, lacquered, dripping into milk bread, finished with a vin jaune sauce. Kevin O’Donnell’s cooking is exact, confident, quietly brilliant, with Laura Chabal shaping the wine list and the welcome. This is precision cooking with real personality, backed by Bastible’s Barry and Claremarie FitzGerald, two of the most experienced people in the business. Dublin has a serious new contender. Read our review here. CH [ Three Dublin restaurants added to Michelin GuideOpens in new window ] A combination of restaurant and wine bar, Fawn is the love child of four friends –Hungarians Ervin Vamoser and Maria Ogl, and Irish chefs Jason O’Neill and Sarah Croffey. The quartet bring experience from Michelin three-star dining and a love of cooking over open fire, using the best of local produce. The extensive wine list, with its focus on wine from eastern Europe, grower champagne and French classics, is truly a delight. JC Manifesto may be gone, but its crew return with La Strada in a room that is styled as a Neapolitan backstreet, full of chatter. Just 15 pizzas and wine on tap keep it sharp. Quattro formaggi is indulgent but balanced, Puttanesca deluxe brings a real anchovy bite, and the Peppa Pig pushes potato, smoked mozzarella and porchetta right to the edge of excess. Read our review here. CH [ Restaurant review: Wine on tap and 15 pizzas on the menu at this Naples style Dublin spotOpens in new window ] Ukrainian baker Mykola Kuleshov has slowly bought Ukrainian food to the heart of Dublin. Starting out with a coffee shop, he introduced us to delicious honey and waffle cakes made using recipes from his grandmother Lucy. Daytime dining came next with a menu of borscht, varenyky dumplings, and deruny potato pancakes served with bacon, sour cream and mushrooms. Now open for weekend evenings; make sure to try the chicken Kyiv. JC Opened in June, Priory Market gives migrant-led and small food businesses a foothold – no rent, no fit-out costs – just 15 per cent of turnover in exchange for a unit, utilities and steady footfall. It’s a mix of serious talent under one roof: Delhi2Dublin’s Indian, Bless Up’s Afro-Caribbean, Flavouritos’ Venezuelan, Seoul Kitchen’s Korean, Zaira’s Lebanese-Brazilian, Park 27’s Asian street food, Buongusto’s pasta, Mama’s Boy banh mi, plus El Milagro, Hell Fire Grill and Coke Lane Pizza. Read our review here. CH [ How Irish restaurants are changing to stay afloat: ‘Less people are going out. Thursday is the new Friday’Opens in new window ] Dunlavin native Liam Browne and his wife Tara Lee Logan have breathed new life into a former traditional village pub with a smart new interior and modern Irish cooking. Under chef Darragh Duffy, the restaurant, bar and brunch menus showcase an extensive range of local and Irish producers. With winter around the corner, look out for smoked beef tartare, comforting free-range chicken pot pie and hearty Sunday lunch. JC In a 30-seat cottage once home to Mews restaurant, Baba’de delivers both kebabs and two-star flourishes. Ahmet Dede and Maria Archer’s offshoot swings from crisp bulgur dumplings over yoghurt foam to lamb ragout to squid erişte under whipped red pepper sauce. The Adana kebab is the standout. Some plates look like tasting-menu showpieces, others like late-night favourites – and that mix is the point. Read our review here. CH Dinner here isn’t about choice – it’s about what the boats and farms bring in. Dave Rowley and Siobhán Ward’s three-course menu, served on Friday and Saturday, offers just three dishes per course, changing weekly with produce from Tom Cleary, Tinnock Farm and Riversfield Farm. Expect solid bistro cooking – pork belly with scallop, prosciutto-wrapped monkfish and yoghurt panna cotta with blackberries. By day it’s a cafe, starting with breakfast and moving into lunch. CH Ballycotton’s loss is Midleton’s gain following Cush’s recent move inland. But even so, the lure of the sea remains strong in Dan Guerin’s kitchen with a continued focus on seafood cooking. Ballycotton mackerel is paired with ado blanco, west Cork roast scallop with crown prince pumpkin and wild roast halibut teams up with seaweed butter. Meat lovers can look forward to Skeaghanore duck or a dry-aged beef chop for two from Murphy’s butchers. JC Chef Peter Everett does not offer a tasting menu in his eponymous restaurant but he does offer keenly priced lunch, pre-theatre and lunch menus. When not supporting his favourite Waterford FC, this chef produces elegant modern Irish dishes using local produce such as Wexford scallops, Tuskar crabmeat and Comeragh mountain lamb. It is located in a 15th-century historic building, and the downstairs wine vault room is perfect for parties and large groups. JC Seafood chowder, halibut with leek and mussel sauce, and duck leg confit with spring onion champ tell you what Farmgate is about – local produce cooked without fuss. Owner Sally O’Brien has made a handsome diningroom of this heritage building, with a long counter for walk-ins and a smaller room at the back. Meat comes from McGrath’s butchers in Lismore, fish from Atlantis in Wexford, vegetables from The County Store in Dungarvan and bread from Dún Bakery and Harrington’s. Read our review here. CH At Forêt, the French onion soup is dark as stout and the free-range chicken au vin jaune is succulent, cloaked in bronzed, crackling skin. It is delicious bistro food, which is no surprise, considering the team behind it are John and Sandy Wyer of Forest Avenue. Paul Brogan, who previously worked in Forest Avenue and as head chef in Variety Jones, now heads up the kitchen, using top-quality produce from McNally family farm, Winetavern farm, and Glenmar seafood. Read our review here. CH Chef Aishling Moore’s marvellous seafood-focused restaurant sets a new standard for “catch of the day”. The menu shifts daily and sometimes mid-service, depending on what sustainable fish lands in the kitchen. Paired with local Cork ingredients, it could be served as irresistible Taiwanese fried fish nuggets, silky pâté or perfectly pan-fried whole with melting cafe de Paris butter. This clever, creative cooking makes it tempting to lick your plate clean. Wines served by the glass, pichet or bottle give plenty of options. AD Chef Jess Murphy has long been a high-profile advocate for Irish produce and sustainable cooking. This autumn sees the publication of her latest cookbook, which showcases 100 of Kai’s best-loved recipes. Always creative, dishes such as Cloud Picker pork chop, John Dory with mussels and Madras crazy water, or the perennially popular lunchtime Kai fish fingers with savage cabbage slaw, keep customers coming back for more. JC Eating out should be buzzy and fun, and Kicky’s delivers in spades, from neon interiors to the charming front-of-house team, and then chef Eric Matthews’s flavourful Mediterranean-inspired menu matches the pace. Not-to-be-missed potato focaccia with whipped carbonara butter, well-sourced fish and meats cooked over fire, luscious pastas and playful desserts are all lapped up along with imaginative cocktails and a versatile wine list. Lunch or dinner, it’s a rollicking good time. AD There’s a lot of history baked into the walls of O’Mahony’s. In operation for more than 200 years, this former traditional village pub has been reimagined as a modern Irish restaurant by Máire O’Mahony and Victor Murphy. Enjoy good value comfort dishes at lunchtime, or share small plates a la carte, paired with a low-intervention, small producer wine list, craft beers and creative cocktails. Look out for upcoming pop-ups and Sunday Neapolitan pizzas. JC This place is a joy. Chef Rebeca Recarey Sanchez, originally from Spain, brings an authentic Mediterranean influence and combines it with superb ingredients from the rich Cork pantry that surrounds her. There’s excellent fish, of course (you’re in Kinsale), but don’t skip on the vegetables. She does magic things including smoked potatoes, XO tempura broccoli and kohlrabi carpaccio with Bottarga. A dynamic, naturally focused wine list suits this relaxed restaurant. AD Fermentation jars, blueberry hot sauce, chicken karaage, Andarl pork with mole verde – Vada doesn’t waste a scrap, and it shows in the cooking. Sarah Boland and head chef Hannah O’Donnell run the kitchen with a Ballymaloe-meets-Kai ethos: stocks made from trims, oils and vinegars from vegetable scraps, apple cores turned into kombucha. Small plates lead – turbot crudo, stracciatella, with halibut pilaf and Andarl pork for mains, and plum tarte Tatin for dessert. CH Read our review here. Regardless of whether it’s sunny, windy or raining, or possibly even all three at once, a stop at Blackrock Cottage is a must when in Salthill. Open for daytime breakfast and lunch and weekend dinners, chef Michael McManus’s goal is to create memories. Try his elevated classics such salmon with brown bread or seafood chowder, or go for one his Asian-inspired hits. The new covered and heated outdoor area is a welcome addition for walkers and pet-owners. JC Takashi Miyazaki’s casual Japanese restaurant puts a strong focus on sustainable ingredients, but always in a fun and relaxed manner. It’s rare that a chef surrenders a Michelin star, but making that decision has allowed Ichigo Ichie to become a Cork nexus for interesting and tasty food, served with a choice range of natural wines. Star billing goes to the handmade buckwheat noodles, served hot and cold in various dishes. JC Izz is more than a cafe – it’s a vibrant meeting of Cork and Palestinian culture, bursting with hospitality and bold, aromatic dishes. Highlights from chef Eman Aburabi include the popular taster plate of hummus, babaganoush, zingy tabbouleh and warm manaeesh. Don’t skip the Musakhan – roast chicken with sumac and spices baked on bread. AD A Chinese grill house where the skewers are the big draw: cumin-dusted duck tongue, mahogany-skinned quail, and spicy lamb with a smoking fat cap. The sides are no afterthought either: crisp chilli-oil potatoes, bubbling corn-and-cheese, and oyster grilled with garlic and glass noodles. Pair it all with beer, which comes by the pint or in giant self-pour pots. Read our review here. CH Tokyo native and classically trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu is the man behind Matsui Ramen, a real-deal weekend ramen joint tucked away in a Kildare GAA club. Try prawn tuskemen, chilled thick noodles with a rich and savoury prawn broth, or warm up with tantanmen, a creamy and sesame child broth with thin noodles and minced pork. And if you fancy getting your hands on authentic Japanese knives to up your kitchen game, Ken is the man to ask. JC Scéal Cafe’s bright and modern interior with windows overlooking the marina is the perfect backdrop for its laser sharp and utterly moreish viennoiserie and speciality coffee. Shelves are stacked with sourdough loaves, which cut open to reveal glossy bubbly interiors. Owners Charlotte Leonard-Kane and Shane Palmer have generated a cult following from their time in Dublin 8, many of whom gladly make the pilgrimage to Greystones for their flaky pastry fix. This autumn has seen the publication of the Scéal cookbook, showing exactly how it’s all done. JC This slick diningroom is a clever mash-up of the Big Fan crew, Hidden Agenda promoters and Whiplash beer – so you’re set for great food, tunes and drinks. The food does tend to steal the show, though; chefs Alex Zhang and Chun Li bring traditional Chinese cooking techniques together with top Irish produce for lip-smacking, umami-rich dumplings, bao and Xiao Chi. Comfy seats are a big bonus, that is, until the music pulls you up for a dance. Read our review here. AD Tang now has four Dublin locations, including its newest on Windmill Lane. Its familiar Middle Eastern-inspired salads and wraps remain wildly popular, alongside queue-worthy brunch dishes, elevated since chef Keith Coleman (ex-Fumbally and Fia) became executive chef. It serves dinner on Thursday and Friday, moving from its Cumberland Place terrace to indoors on Abbey Street for the winter. Expect more vibrant, colourful plates of Middle Eastern favourites and a lively drinks list. Read our review here. AD Long a tourist town, Killarney has steadily established a quality food and drink scene in recent years. Nowhere embodies this more than Tango, a combination Argentinian parrilla and Neapolitan pizza restaurant from Facundo Rodulfo and Pamela Neumann. A lover of fire and grill, Rodulfo marries his heritage and experiences in beef empanadas, choripan sausage sandwiches and oozing grilled provolone cheese. Look out for Tango’s first cookbook or attend a masterclass to learn the tricks for yourself. JC Breakfast is now served in this restored 1820s coach house, where three fires burn all day. Lunch and dinner bring confit duck croquettes with butternut squash purée, croque monsieur with house-baked ham and Comté, and Kilmore Quay monkfish with charred baby gem. Next door, you’ll find Roundwood Stores bakery offers more casual options. CH Our pizza obsession owes much to brothers Ronan and Eugene Greaney, whose Dough Bros business continues to thrive. This year they opened Lil’ Bros slice shop on Eyre Square, but Middle Street remains the best place to experience their craft – quirky, creative Neapolitan pizzas showcasing top Irish artisan ingredients, cooked fresh and fast in a wood-fired oven. They also offer a stellar list of soft drinks, local beers and quaffable wines. AD You need to prepare yourself for dinner at Aniar where the 2.0 tasting menu delivers an astounding 24 courses, each a showcase for the west of Ireland. Kelp and sea beet rub shoulders with lamb and beef in a menu that covers both sea and land. JP McMahon is not known for sitting still and, in the 14 years that Aniar has been open, he has constantly sought to push boundaries and build an Irish food heritage. JC It has been 30 years since the mother and daughter duo of Ann and Colleen McMahon opened Cafe Rua, followed by a deli-shop in 2008. Now run by Colleen and her brother Aran, the two locations are truly part of the town’s heartbeat. Open for lunch and breakfast, try dishes such as crispy fried egg and pepperonata on Cornrue sourdough toast, or pan-fried hake with hollandaise, Bombay spiced potato and greens. Or simply stop for coffee and some excellent cake. JC When we discuss industry stalwarts, some names just keep coming up. Garrett Byrne’s Campagne is one such spot, with smart, crisp classic cooking that just consistently delivers. Always seasonal, the menu currently features royale of wood pigeon with figs and girolles and slow-cooked duck with aubergines and ceps. With partner Bríd Hannon running the restaurant and superb value set menus, Campagne is always the smart money. JC A 45-year-old multigenerational restaurant, China Sichuan is known for its upmarket Sichuan dishes which incorporate quality Irish ingredients. Try fried soft shell crab with toasted almonds and chilli, Irish lobster with ginger and scallion sauce or tea smoked duck. This year saw the opening of China Sichuan To Go, a casual all-day spot for quick bites or takeaway, but with all of the flair of the original. JC [ China Sichuan to Go takeaway review: The aromatic duck alone is worth the tripOpens in new window ] Every neighbourhood needs a good cafe, one that makes a great cup of coffee and always welcomes you with a smile. Celebrating 15 years in business this year, Foodgame surely meets these requirements. The menu is short but it’s all about the details and the execution. Simple soft scrambled Tolka eggs come with perfectly crisp O’Neill’s bacon, coffee is from Ariosa and the BLT, made with Annie’s Farm organic leaves, proudly declares itself the best in town. JC This Cork favourite still feels fresh after over a decade in business thanks to its ever-evolving wine list and fun approach to dining. The wine list has more than 400 bottles and 30 by the glass in varying sizes. The menu matches adventurous sipping with small plates combining Irish ingredients and European influences. Think spiced beef tongue with sauerkraut and salsa verde, colcannon croquettes and the irresistible winter return of whole baked Mont d’Or. AD Neven and Amelda Maguire are approaching a quarter of a century in business at MacNean House, and its reputation for warm hospitality and generous cooking is as strong as ever. The nine-course Prestige tasting menu offers options for several courses, thus giving diners the best of all worlds. Having trained under the genial Neven himself, chef Carmel McGirr delivers hearty and tasty food that everyone will enjoy. JC [ Neven Maguire on recipes, restaurants and working out to dance records at 6amOpens in new window ] Monty’s of Kathmandu has been flying the Nepalese flag in Temple Bar since 1997 – long before the area became a tourist trap. Shiva and Lina Gautam’s restaurant remains proudly, unmistakably Nepalese; momos steamed to order, smoky breads and kebabs from the charcoal tandoor, goat curry and Nepalese biryani alongside Lina’s sag chat. There’s a two-course midweek menu from €32, but the a la carte is where the cooking shows its depth. An award-winning 85-page wine list starts at €28 and includes icons such as Domaine Romanée-Conti and Château Pétrus. Read our review here. CH Chef Sunil Ghai directly imports rare Indian spices to create a menu that combines north Indian cuisine with the best Irish produce. The result is an invigorating menu full of dishes you’ll want to try – street food snacks, aromatic curries, birianis and the unmissable Goat Keema Pao. The chef’s tasting menu offers a wonderful insight into the inventive cooking here. Portions are generous, service lovely and the food delicious; no wonder it is always busy. AD The Slattery family have been in charge at the Station House since 1984 and under their stewardship this former railway station has been turned into a cozy and bright boutique hotel. The Signal Restaurant celebrates local produce from the surrounding Boyne Valley and all around Ireland. Look out for the regular Boyne Valley dinners in their Signal restaurant which are truly generous, especially when paired with the hotel’s unique wine list. JC The Pig’s Ear went backwards to move forward – who knew it would work so well? After their brief Lotus Eaters phase, Andrea Hussey and Stephen McAllister returned with a new incarnation, diving deep into Dublin’s past. The result is original, personality-led cooking – famine soup with bone marrow toast, Dublin coddle, sharing mulligatawny chicken pie. The generous wine list is put together by people who love wine, boasting 22 by the glass. Alternatively, you could opt for a pint of the black stuff and lean into the auld Dublin vibe. Read our review here. AD Paul and Máire Flynn have been flying the flag for great Irish food and hospitality at the Tannery for more than 20 years. These days they are joined by chef Damien Derwin (ex-Pig’s Ear), who deftly carries on Flynn’s love for robust flavours, classic dishes and shining the light on local suppliers. It’s a popular spot for celebrations and get-togethers because it’s one of those restaurants you know will deliver. Longevity with consistent quality like this should be applauded. AD It’s the mark of a good restaurant that you are drawn there time and time again. Such is the case at John and Tara Coffey’s welcoming spot in the heart of Athlone. Every dish is meticulously presented and worthy of its own Instagram post but, most importantly, also tastes delicious. Try ballotine of quail, brill with dillisk beurre blanc or a slice of Young Buck served with crackers made using spent grain from the brewery next door. JC Chef Chris McGowan doesn’t simply give diners a few dishes from which to choose. Every menu is packed with options, leaving you to wonder how the kitchen manages to do it all. There are always lighter options such as shellfish ravioli with Kilkeel crab or skate wing on the bone, but Wine & Brine really excels in game season, with roast mallard, wood pigeon and partridge all taking their turn to shine. JC This stylish, wood-panelled room is owners Jumoke Akintola and Peter Hogan’s homage to the Spanish tapas bars they love, and it shows in the menu full of top-notch Irish ingredients cooked with plenty of Spanish inspiration. Choose from the chalkboard – oozy croquetas, Connemara oysters, crab sandwich, maybe a stew. Wash it down with something from their 300-plus eclectic wine list, offering 20 or so by the glass, including sparkling, orange wines and sherries. AD There’s a welcome old-school glamour at China Tang and a menu to match. Cantonese dim sum, roasted meats, Sichuan and Hunan dishes are delivered with flair, but the show stopper is the signature roasted Peking duck carved tableside (must be pre-ordered). Bring a gang to work through the extensive menu for a great time. Read our review here. AD This intimate wine bar may be small, but it packs bold flavours and an exceptional wine list curated by co-owner Zsolt Lukács, crowned Michelin sommelier of the year in 2025. Chef Stiofán Feeney’s seasonal small plates, such as polenta cakes with Comté and Dexter beef tartare, build up to a substantial dinner, perfect for pairing with the 40 by-the-glass wine options. Read our review here. AD After a bumpy start in 2024 with a mixed Asian menu, Kaldero smartly relaunched this summer with Bahay – the Irish Filipino concept from chef Richie Castillo and food creative Alex O’Neill. Now it’s all about the dishes for which Castillo is celebrated: golden lumpia spring rolls, rich kare kare braised oxtail with peanut sauce, and inihaw na manok, barbecue chicken skewers glazed with banana ketchup. It’s a wonderful showcase of his Irish and Filipino heritage on a plate. AD Walking past La Gordita takes you immediately to the streets of Spain. The classic wooden and glass exterior beckons you in for a glass of good Spanish red or a nutty amontillado sherry. With a long bar running down the middle and tables at either end, it’s always buzzing. Chef María Luisa Moraleda knows how to deliver a menu of signature dishes such as anchovies with blue cheese butter and ever-changing seasonal specials. JC Lena starts with a sage leaf and an anchovy – fried to a crackle – two bites that set the bar unreachably high. Liz Matthews, Simon Barrett and Paul McNamara – the team behind Etto and Uno Mas – seem incapable of putting a foot wrong. Italian-inspired plates follow: wild sea bass crudo with blood orange and rosemary, pici cacio e pepe that leaves you licking the plate, and halibut with vermouth sauce. No wonder it’s the toughest booking in Dublin right now. It’s the perfect restaurant. Read our review here. CH [ Lena, Portobello review: This is the perfect restaurant, with the best fish dish I have eaten in yearsOpens in new window ] The Great British Menu has been a fantastic showcase for Northern chefs in recent years, most particularly for self-taught Steafan McCarry. Years of innovation for this devotee of fin-to-tail cooking culminated in the overall region win this year. With wife Rebekah, he has added a new events space to Lir, and is looking forward to a winter of special collaboration evenings with other superb local talent. JC Chef Gráinne O’Keefe may have published a book about cooking for one this year, but you’re advised to bring friends or family when dining at Mae. There’s just too much to enjoy solo. The set menu features dishes such as smoked Hegarty’s cheddar agnolotti, brown butter fillet of hake and the decadent tarte Tatin. Diners can choose from a selection of individual handcrafted knives, and the wine pairings from downstairs The French Paradox are unique. JC The hype hasn’t faded – nor should it. Reggie White’s low-waste pizzeria in a reworked redbrick in Rathmines is one of the most exciting rooms in Dublin, humming with families, students and couples sharing bottles of wine over 48-hour fermented wild-farmed sourdough pizzas. The whey-braised leek with Cashel Blue and honey and the Andarl Farm sausage are standouts, and nothing costs more than €18.50. Soon, there’ll be pasta too – because why stop at great pizza? Read our review here. CH The grandeur of this historic 19th-century room is the perfect canvas for chef Adam Nevin’s dynamic cooking. After winning a Michelin star last year, the food featuring exquisite ingredients continues to wow. Go all out with the tasting menu (€150) or visit on Sunday for a pared-back four-course (€95). A champagne trolley and classic wine list with big hitters are fitting partners. AD Leona and Linda are the charming ex-Orient Express carriages that are home to the Pullman restaurant. Reopening this year after an extensive renovation, the two ladies are smarter than ever. Working from an adjacent purpose-built kitchen, chef Angelo Vagiotis, pastry chef Linda Sergidou and the rest of the Pullman team are driving a refined tasting menu experience worthy of the setting, while restaurant manager Ian McDonnell walks the aisles with wines to match. JC Variety Jones may have moved premises and settled into a gorgeous new home on the corner of Thomas Street, but some things will never change. There will always be the signature waffles and pasta on the tasting menu. The sharing main will always be a joyously riotous affair. The wine list is always good. Open-fire cooking is used as much as possible and, in the words of owner Keelan Higgs, “you’re in for a good time, not a long time”. JC Since opening in 2008, Ananda has delivered exceptional Indian food in spectacular surroundings. The elegant and spacious diningroom is a perfect match for the vibrant dishes, be it Goan-style halibut with prawns and lemon leaf bouillabaisse or lentil dumplings with masala Glenilen yoghurt and aged tamarind preserve. Plump for the tasting menu to enjoy the full experience, paired with well-chosen wines. JC A quiet haven for local craftspeople is an appropriate backdrop for Phelim O’Hagan’s restaurant and its keen focus on Northern ingredients. Opened in 2021, a listing in the Michelin guide soon followed, secured via dishes such as Donegal Dexter beef rump with shortrib croquette and Guinness rarebit, butter poached cod with saffron potato and Gubbeen chorizo. JC With muted green walls, blonde wood furniture and plenty of space, the diningroom at Bastible manages to stay on just the right side of austere. The open kitchen takes up the far end, with most diners able to get a good view of the chefs at work. The tasting menu echoes the room, with pared-back dishes that pack quite a punch. Understated, yes, but superbly executed and matched with a very good wine list. Read our review here. JC There are no hushed tones in this two-Michelin-starred diningroom, just warm welcomes and lively service. Beautifully executed dishes, using luxe ingredients, are often swoon-worthy, particularly when it comes to the pastry. The whole thing feels like a seasoned orchestra playing; everything in the room and on the plate is in harmony. Sure, it’s not cheap, but with nothing else like it, it feels worth the spend. AD [ Chapter One chef Mickael Viljanen: ‘I was meant to stay in Ireland for a year and that’s 24 years ago’Opens in new window ] After 20 years, Dax still delivers Dublin’s most refined take on classical French cooking. Graham Neville’s plates – courgette flowers stuffed with Dublin Bay prawns, John Dory, Tipperary beef, and mille-feuille of Irish rhubarb – are elegant and precise. Owner Olivier Meisonnave runs the floor with aplomb and has built one of the country’s great wine lists, stretching from biodynamic bottles to Grand Cru heavyweights. Lunch, from Wednesday to Saturday, is one of the city’s great escapes; dinner carries the same quiet assurance. CH Inside this picture-perfect thatched cottage you’ll find terrific Michelin-starred modern Irish cuisine by chef Robbie McCauley. Seasonal game, Aran turbot, Galway chanterelles and produce from the kitchen garden are crafted into pretty plates of food with real substance. Flagstone floors and open fires set the scene for cosy yet refined dining, matched by a drinks list featuring more than 450 wines. AD Tucked away in one of the darker corners of Blackrock market, the entrance to Liath is brightly illuminated, drawing diners into the comfort inside. Although this is a small restaurant, it is big in attitude and character, with a sublime tasting menu experience. The restaurant’s social media doesn’t profile current dishes, meaning that diners will truly be experiencing dishes for the first time. JC A top spot for modern Irish fine dining with no fuss. Chef-proprietor Kevin Burke and team use lots of local, seasonal ingredients and take a contemporary approach to classic cooking, with delicious results such as turbot head with moreish miso cooked over fire or addictive horseradish choux buns. A thoughtful wine list pairs well with the innovative menu. After four years of refinement, it just keeps getting better and is now happily open on Monday. AD It’s often said that achieving a Michelin star allows a chef to relax. Who knows if it’s true, but Danny Africano’s sleek Lignum is certainly flying high since winning one earlier this year. Cooking over open flame is at the soul of this kitchen, which produces dishes so beautiful you may feel guilty about eating them. The Saturday and Sunday five-course lunch menus offer excellent value. Read our review here. JC It’s always a pleasure to dine at Ox, whether it’s during the daytime with light flooding in through the large windows, or in the evening when a cosier atmosphere settles over the room. Over the years, Stephen Toman and Alain Kerloc’h have never wavered in their dedication to quality. Enjoy classic gougères made with Coolattin cheddar, Thornill duck with hispi and elderberries, and elevated vanilla rice pudding, served with Alain’s wonderful wine pairings. Read our review here. JC The Glass Curtain continues to evolve, having built a solid reputation for large dishes, ideal for sharing around the table, all cooked over open fire. Frequent collaborations bring new ideas to the kitchen, with seasonal and foraged produce at the centre. Brian Murray’s list of suppliers reads like a who’s who of Cork food royalty, and the sleek modern interior is a fun place to be with friends and family. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin one-star restaurant is best known for its €120 tasting menu, but the €75 four-course at 5.45pm shows the same precision in a shorter form. It opens with brown soda bread and house-smoked cultured butter before moving on to dishes that show Krawczyk at his sharpest – native crab with smoked mackerel royale, egg baked in brown butter with trout roe, a loose-crumbed fish cake folded with herbs, and vinegared strawberries and cultured cream. CH Named after the secret Masonic society that met there more than 200 years ago, Gareth McCaughey’s restaurant is certainly no secret to Belfast diners. His philosophy is to keep things simple while using the very best of ingredients. The menu changes regularly, but look out for dishes such as Wicklow venison with beetroot and plum, Mourne lamb with aubergine and miso, or the cherry and tonka bean tart. In a welcome move, there are more than 75 wines available by the glass. JC This cosy city-centre spot has evolved beautifully over five years from brunch cafe to impressive modern Irish bistro. Seasonal, local produce from top Cork suppliers shines in confidently French-inspired cooking. Everything seems to come with an irresistible sauce, dip or side, such as cheesy cheese croquettes with date ketchup, or Anne’s brown bread with burnt onion butter. Bonus points for the natural-wine-focused wine list always having a big by-the-glass selection. AD The sizzle of dosa and steam of chai set the tone – southern Indian cooking that starts at breakfast and doesn’t stop. Mornings bring dosa, idli, vada and uttappam; by lunch it’s biryanis, thali platters, Gutti Vankaya curry, mutton fry and chicken Chettinadu. The Marlborough Street original now has siblings on Abbey Street and in Belfast, all serving the same deep menu built for repeat visits. Thalis stand out, with Gobi 65, gongura prawns and lamb Chettinadu showing their range. Read our review here. CH On the main street of this planned estate town, Bramley is an elegant and spacious venue serving casual lunch and upscale dinners. Chef Sam Moody brings extensive fine-dining experience to dishes such as a crispy chicken schnitzel Caesar salad, honey-glazed quail and wild Irish venison with spiced date puree. The supper menu available from Wednesday to Friday offers exceptional value, especially when matched with a glass from the well chosen wine list. JC Philip Yueng’s refined neighbourhood restaurant Craft is approaching its 10th birthday and the consensus is that it has never been better. His style of modern Irish food with subtle Asian influences has proven consistently popular with locals. The three-course lunch menu for €25 or evening time chef’s menu for €39 is certainly excellent value, but the a la carte is equally worth a browse. With the winter months drawing in, the return of the Sunday roast is very welcome. JC Few restaurants cook at this level for the money. Kevin and Shirley Stirzake’s €44 and €63 menus get you three courses and a sorbet, with dishes such as Falls goat’s cheese, Keem Bay smoked salmon, West Coast crab, scallops with pork belly, Hereford sirloin and rack of lamb. CH Raffaele Rasso now heads the kitchen at this Michelin Bib Gourmand neighbourhood restaurant, where the early evening menu (€35/€40, Wed-Fri, 5pm-6.30pm) is a bargain. Expect Silverhill duck leg croquettes with fried artichoke, broad bean hummus, chicken thigh with smoked cannellini beans, seabass with kombu gnocchi, and tonka bean panna cotta to finish. CH Usually, we’d slag someone off for having notions in Ireland, but not here. Instead, we’re delighted to see Two Pups cafe on Francis Street transformed after hours into a bistro-style evening restaurant. The casual sharing menu features star suppliers and current Irish menu favourites such as hispi cabbage, oysters, padron peppers and cod roe. Breads come from their own Bold Boy Bakery, and there’s a playful natural wine list. Read our review here. AD Nabbing a window seat here is always a treat, with harbour views over Dún Laoghaire. It’s a hotel restaurant, but it feels more like a buzzy local bistro, with an Italian-leaning menu of Lambay crab arancini, scallops in chicken butter sauce, wood-fired meats, seafood, and rich pastas (the pizzas quietly bowed out this summer). The wine list leans Italian too, with plenty offered by the glass or carafe. AD Rúibín is that rare kind of place where you feel at home from the minute you walk in the door. Maybe it’s the beautiful stone building with even more exposed stone inside. Or maybe it’s the excellent cocktails. Open for lunch, dinner and bar food, Rúibín’s style is contemporary and delicious. Try trout crudo with buttermilk, dill and apple, muscovado-brined pork chop or monkfish fillet with sobrassada butter. JC It’s all go at Conor Halpenny’s Square restaurant, which recently nearly doubled in capacity, while its partnership with local An Táin Arts Centre offers good value pre-theatre dining menus. A former Euro-Toque young chef of the year and current Georgina Campbell chef of the year, Halpenny blends classic techniques with modern trends to create dishes such as Square KFC or monkfish with pickled mussels. JC The combination of outstanding modern Irish dishes from chef Stephen McArdle and exceptional wines from his partner and sommelier Morgan VanderKamer is what makes Union wine bar and restaurant so special. Occupying a former pub, the front is cozy and perfect for a glass of wine while the dining room opens up to the rear. With more than 35 wines available by the glass and a tasty bar bites menu, the Déise is calling. JC Blackrock residents are spoilt to have this as their local spot. Chef Barry Sun’s modern European cooking with Asian influences (there is usually a delicious dumpling on offer) shows up as colourful plates of food full of texture. There’s great value in their €38 neighbourhood four-course menu on Wednesdays and Thursdays and three-course lunch menu on Fridays and Saturdays. Seasonal aperitifs and an interesting wine list make it all the more special. AD © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: From factory floor to financialized property: The decline of production and the rise of the rentier economy
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2025/11/from_factory_floor_to_financialized_property_the_decline_of_production_and_the_rise_of_the_rentier_economy.html

Full Content:
The erosion of the domestic manufacturing base and the corresponding ascent of real estate as the primary generator of wealth represents a fundamental, structural shift from a productive economy to a rentier economy. This transformation marks a change not merely in what America makes, but in how value is conceived and extracted, creating deep social and political consequences that dwarf the cyclical nature of previous economic downturns. This shift is characterized by the replacement of the wealth-generating factory floor with the wealth-extracting property deed. Historically, the American promise was rooted in productive capitalism, where value was created through labor, skill, and the transformation of raw materials into finished goods. The factory provided stable, high-wage jobs that translated directly into middle-class stability and accessible homeownership. The economic engine was powered by reinvesting profits into innovation and expansion, generating tangible wealth. The city was a center of making things. However, as globalization accelerated and industrial policy waned, manufacturing retreated, leaving vast economic and social vacuums. Into this vacuum stepped the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate (FIRE) sector. The focus shifted from generating profits through production (e.g., selling a car) to generating rents through asset ownership and control (e.g., collecting rent on a portfolio of homes, fees on financial transactions). The critical distinction is that rentier activity extracts existing value without necessarily creating new, productive wealth. Real estate, in particular, became the new economic darling. This was structurally amplified by the complicity of the Democrat and Republican parties and the IRS in ignoring necessary tax code revisions. The unrevised code did not just offer deductions; it created a systemic incentive where the government effectively subsidizes asset ownership. The core loophole is the ability to claim depreciation as a deduction, generating “paper losses” that shield real income from taxation, even as the property itself appreciates in market value. This mechanism encourages wealth-seeking capital to utilize real estate as a shelter from high tax penalties, inflating property values far beyond the reach of local wages. For savvy high-net-worth investors, this loophole is maximized through techniques like cost segregation and bonus depreciation. Cost segregation studies break the property’s value into separate components (like carpeting, appliances, and land improvements) that can be depreciated over short periods (5, 7, or 15 years), rather than the standard 27.5 years for the structure. This accelerated depreciation, often coupled with bonus depreciation rules, creates massive non-cash deductions in the early years of ownership. This results in taxable losses on paper that can offset other forms of income, such as salaries or business profits. In essence, the combination of tax deductions (interest, taxes, maintenance) and non-cash paper losses (depreciation) allows investors to finance the acquisition and holding costs of high-end homes largely through reduced federal tax obligations, making the U.S. government a silent financial co-signer for the rentier class. This ascendancy of rentier wealth is corrosive because it fundamentally severs the link between hard work and economic security. When a city’s health is measured not by its output but by its rising property values, it inevitably privileges the owner and the investor over the producer and the laborer. It creates a state of economic dependence—the non-asset-holding majority must pay rents (housing, fees, interest) to the asset-holding minority. The political landscape becomes dominated by lobbying efforts aimed at protecting asset values and extracting rents (rent-seeking), further distorting governance away from policies focused on productive economic growth. In conclusion, the movement from manufacturing dominance to real estate reliance is far more significant than a simple sectoral transition; it is an ideological pivot from value creation to value extraction—consider the role BlackRock and Vanguard have played in this trend. This shift was tragically facilitated by policy inaction, as the failure to revise the tax code regarding depreciation, cost segregation, and paper losses created the critical loophole that funneled wealth into asset speculation. The resulting structural change—the severe reliance on asset ownership over productive labor—has not only cemented deep inequality but has directly contributed to the social crises we suffer today, most visibly in the proliferation of homelessness and drug epidemics across the nation. This defines the new landscape of wealth and power, suggesting a future where economic gains flow primarily to those who control the ground, not those who build upon it. Image generated by ChatGPT. The erosion of the domestic manufacturing base and the corresponding ascent of real estate as the primary generator of wealth represents a fundamental, structural shift from a productive economy to a rentier economy. This transformation marks a change not merely in what America makes, but in how value is conceived and extracted, creating deep social and political consequences that dwarf the cyclical nature of previous economic downturns. This shift is characterized by the replacement of the wealth-generating factory floor with the wealth-extracting property deed. Historically, the American promise was rooted in productive capitalism, where value was created through labor, skill, and the transformation of raw materials into finished goods. The factory provided stable, high-wage jobs that translated directly into middle-class stability and accessible homeownership. The economic engine was powered by reinvesting profits into innovation and expansion, generating tangible wealth. The city was a center of making things. However, as globalization accelerated and industrial policy waned, manufacturing retreated, leaving vast economic and social vacuums. Into this vacuum stepped the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate (FIRE) sector. The focus shifted from generating profits through production (e.g., selling a car) to generating rents through asset ownership and control (e.g., collecting rent on a portfolio of homes, fees on financial transactions). The critical distinction is that rentier activity extracts existing value without necessarily creating new, productive wealth. Real estate, in particular, became the new economic darling. This was structurally amplified by the complicity of the Democrat and Republican parties and the IRS in ignoring necessary tax code revisions. The unrevised code did not just offer deductions; it created a systemic incentive where the government effectively subsidizes asset ownership.

Title: Crypto Adoption Grows Among Hedge Funds: New Survey Shows 55% Participation In 2025

Throughout the year, President Donald Trump’s crypto policies have spurred a notable increase in the adoption of digital assets through various channels, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and crypto-focused treasuries. As a result, a recent survey conducted by the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) and PwC revealed that the percentage of traditional hedge funds holding cryptocurrencies has climbed to 55%, up from 47% in 2024. Despite the ongoing volatility in crypto markets, 47% of institutional investors surveyed expressed that the current regulatory environment, shaped by Trump’s appointments of crypto-friendly agency heads and the implementation of the GENIUS Act has encouraged them to increase their allocations to digital assets. James Delaney, managing director of asset management regulation at AIMA, commented on the findings, stating: For most of these funds, regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier. This year, those barriers are starting to be removed. This year’s report may mark a turning point in overcoming these challenges. However, regulatory clarity isn’t the sole factor driving institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The fear of missing out (FOMO) on substantial market gains is also a compelling motivator. The survey highlighted that alongside traditional hedge funds, specialized fund managers with at least 50% of their assets in crypto have emerged, with several new funds launched this year. Among the crypto-focused funds, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the most commonly held asset, closely followed by Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Notably, Solana saw a surge in popularity this year, with 73% of the funds now holding it, a marked increase from 45% in 2024. On average, hedge funds have allocated about 7% of their assets to crypto, up from 6% the previous year, although over half of the respondents commit less than 2%. Encouragingly, 71% of those surveyed indicated plans to increase their crypto exposure within the next twelve months. Major firms are also showing interest in this space. Brevan Howard Asset Management has reportedly appointed a former executive from Peter Thiel’s family office to lead a crypto-focused investment division. Additionally, asset managers like Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Elliott Investment Management have disclosed holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked ETFs. According to the AIMA survey, the proportion of respondents using ETFs has risen to 33%, compared to 25% the previous year. The survey indicated that the most popular access method to the digital asset market among managers is through derivatives, with 67% of respondents utilizing them, an increase from 58% in 2024. Spot trading has also grown, rising to 40% from 25%. Moreover, some asset managers are exploring the tokenization of their funds, similar to initiatives by firms like BlackRock. Over half of the survey participants expressed interest in this approach. Lastly, the survey found that 43% of traditional hedge funds investing in crypto plan to enhance or initiate their engagement with DeFi over the next three years, with nearly a third believing that DeFi could disrupt their business models.

Title: Final Fantasy developer Square Enix plans to automate 70% of its QA with AI even as it continues layoffs in the west

Time Published: 2025-11-07T03:14:00Z
Full Content:
Square Enix is pushing to automate 70% of its QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027, following its announcement of widespread layoffs across its Western offices. The company explained its new initiative in its latest progress report for its medium-term business plan, “Square Enix Reboots and Awakens,” to address problems such as low sales of games like Final Fantasy XIV. Square Enix is teaming up with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, consisting of a team of researchers from the lab and Square Enix engineers. The end goal is to make QA faster and cheaper. QA testing traditionally involves manual testing of games for bugs, glitches, and issues, which is exhausting in titles like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. Square Enix’s report explicitly stated, “To automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027.” This means that an AI debugging system could automatically generate test scenarios, simulate player behavior, and isolate bugs and issues in video games. While similar tools exist in engines like Unreal Engine 5, Square Enix seems determined to take things a step further. However, this development strategy doesn’t come without sacrifice, as on the very same day Square Enix laid off over 100 employees across its UK, U.S., and European offices, calling it a “fundamental restructuring” of its overseas publishing arm and a “best position for the group’s long-term growth.” However, the company didn’t explicitly state that the job cuts were linked to the QA AI push. Still, speculation suggests the company could soon replace a significant portion of its testing staff with AI. Square Enix isn’t the only company leaping into AI, though. A September 2025 survey by CESA asked 54 companies about AI, and 51% confirmed they’re using generative AI for artwork, story concepts, and coding. An additional 31% confirmed they were using AI to build game engines. Square Enix claims AI will help the company compete in an industry where AAA games are costing exponentially more to develop over the years due to rising licensing, labor, and QA costs as the bar continues to be raised higher. It is important, however, to note that the company itself is doing considerably well financially this quarter, thanks in part to Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. Despite its enthusiasm, the QA automation push seems like a high-stakes bet for the company, as it risks alienating talent that might be hard to replace should it backfire. Employee morale is already strained at the company, and the coming years will show if Square Enix’s “reboot” will genuinely pay off.

Title: BlackRock Exec Drops Trillion-Dollar Revelation At Ripple Swell, But Is XRP Ready?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference in New York has quickly become one of the most talked-about events in the crypto and finance world. Among the highlights was a statement from Maxwell Stein, a member of BlackRock’s digital assets team, that sent the audience into applause and resonated with enthusiasts on social media. He revealed that the global financial market is now ready for large-scale blockchain adoption, and the infrastructure being built by companies like Ripple could soon facilitate the movement of trillions of dollars on-chain. During his session, Stein highlighted the transformation underway in global finance, noting that traditional securities are still held in legacy systems but that this separation between traditional and tokenized assets is gradually disappearing. He explained that in the short term, proving utility is the most important thing to gaining broader adoption and that there are currently two types of users driving this shift: those already in the crypto space and a second wave of early institutional adopters. Stein emphasized the need for continued market momentum to demonstrate the practical usefulness of blockchain solutions and attract larger financial players. “We need that market momentum in order to prove the utility, to actually get the larger players to eventually come in,” he said. As noted by an XRP advocate with the name Diana on the social media platform X, Stein credited Ripple and other early builders for proving that blockchain works. Not as a concept, but as real financial infrastructure. The idea that trillions in capital could eventually move through blockchain rails represents a fundamental change in how the world’s financial systems might operate. The idea sounded like a myth back when the crypto industry was first created. What once seemed like a distant fantasy in crypto’s early days has begun to take shape as reality, and big names like traditional finance are now moving into the crypto industry every day. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also shared her perspective at the event, focusing on the need for regulatory clarity to encourage broader institutional participation in the digital asset space. She explained that major institutions want to engage but require clearly defined rules that prioritize investor protection and establish stable frameworks. According to her, once such clarity is achieved, these institutions can confidently enter the market knowing that they are operating under secure and transparent guidelines. Friedman added that significant progress is already happening within traditional finance, as many banks are experimenting with tokenized bonds, fixed income instruments, and the creation of stablecoins. This growing involvement is evidence that institutions are not waiting for innovation to reach them. They are actively finding ways to participate in the digital asset ecosystem while awaiting the full regulatory go-ahead. “But I think to get them really engaged in the market, there has to be regulatory clarity,” Friedman said.

US stock market fell hard today as AI hype cracked. The Nasdaq plunged 1.9%, the S&P 500 slipped 1.1%, and the Dow lost 0.8%. Tesla slid 3.5% before Musk’s pay vote. Nvidia, Amazon, and Palantir also tanked as investors questioned AI valuations. Job cuts surged to 153,074, the most since 2003. The 10-year yield eased to 4.09%, and Bitcoin floated near $100,900. Wall Street’s red close showed AI fever cooling fast — and investor nerves rising again.

Title: Australia risks ‘missed opportunity’ by shirking tokenisation: top regulator
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/australia-risks-missed-opportunity-embrace-tokenisation-asic
Time Published: 2025-11-07T01:07:14Z

The head of Australia’s market regulator, Joe Longo, is looking to embrace tokenization in Australia’s capital markets, fearing the country will fall behind if it doesn’t act. Australia’s capital markets risk being outpaced by other countries unless it embraces new technology such as tokenization, says the country’s head market regulator. “As other countries adapt and innovate, there’s a real risk Australia could become the ‘land of missed opportunity’ or be passive recipients of developments overseas,” Australian Securities and Investments Commission Chair Joe Longo told the National Press Club on Wednesday. Over $35.8 billion worth of real-world assets are currently tokenized onchain, which Boston Consulting Group estimated could rise to $16 trillion by 2030, while McKinsey & Co predicted a more conservative $2 trillion over the same time frame. Market regulators in the US have also floated the idea of 24/7 trading, which “may be more viable in some asset classes than others,” leading finance leaders such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to push for the tokenization of everything from stocks and bonds to money market funds as a solution. Longo said Australia was an early adoptor of electronic trading systems with the Australian Securities Exchange’s securities settlement system, the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, or CHESS. He noted that the first tokenized bond was issued in Sydney in 2018. “Now, other countries are outpacing us,” he said. “Distributed ledger technology that facilitates asset tokenisation could fundamentally transform our capital markets, in the same way as the introduction of CHESS once did.” Longo said he met with US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins last month, who made him realize that Australia is in a battle with others to court as much capital as possible to “seize a larger slice” of the rapidly emerging tokenization market. Longo said the regulator is looking to “do more to support innovation from the ground up” and will relaunch its Innovation Hub to support innovation by helping startup fintech firms navigate regulations. Related: Regulators must protect the architecture of freedom It comes about a week after ASIC released its updated guidance on how digital asset innovation should be balanced with investor protection. Longo expects tokenization to accelerate faster than anticipated, having cited discussions with JPMorgan staff who told him that they plan to tokenize their money market funds within the next two years. Four of JPMorgan’s largest money market funds hold a combined $730 billion worth of assets. Tokenizing these asset classes will also enable a broader range of traders to access markets that have traditionally been limited to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, Longo noted.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr This Week: Navan’s “Disappointing” $5B IPO, VCs Getting 6% Instead of 20%, and the Fire-Half-Your-Team AI Test: The New Venture Reality

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason this week. The venture landscape has fundamentally shifted. A $4.5B exit is no longer enough for mega-funds, ownership targets are getting crushed across the board, and if your SaaS company didn’t see AI-driven reacceleration in 2025, you’ve failed. Meanwhile, the best Series A environment in years is hidden behind pricing pressure, and every “mature” software company better be capturing dollars from the AI spend explosion—or they’re headed for a 3x revenue PE buyout. Navan’s IPO at $700M revenue, 32% growth, and a ~$5B market cap should be a massive win. Instead, it feels like a disappointment. Why? Because mature SaaS companies are now trading at 6-7x NTM revenue — or less — and with fund sizes exploding, VCs need $10B+ outcomes to move the needle. As Jason put it bluntly: “Is a $4.5 billion exit good enough today? It’s a horrible thing to say, but if we’re talking about in VC and inside baseball, it’s a bonafide question.” The math is unforgiving. Lightspeed invested $257M into Navan and returned ~$1B for a 4x blended return. Their early rounds probably returned 20-30x, but following with $200M+ in late-stage capital diluted that spectacular early return down to “just” 4x on the total investment. For a $2B fund, even a billion-dollar return only gets you a third of the way to 1x. Benchmark—the gold standard of ownership discipline—only secured 10% of Mercor at a massive valuation. Jason’s last three deals came in at 6-8% ownership despite his rule being double-digit ownership of two winners per fund. Y Combinator has institutionalized 10% rounds at demo day (3 on 30, 4 on 40), leaving seed VCs scrambling for 5-6% unless they “way overbid and basically do two rounds at once.” The paradox: Both hyper-capital-efficient companies (that don’t need much money) and hyper-capital-inefficient companies (that need billions) result in low ownership for VCs. As Rory noted: “A founder’s optimized fundraising is a VC’s below ownership target.” Jason delivered one of the spiciest takes of the episode: “You better have gotten a few nickels out of the AI expenditures.. Some growth from all that massive AI spend in 2025. If you didn’t, if you’re not growing faster at the end of 2025 than at the start, then as a founder, I give you an F minus.” The data backs him up. Twilio went from single-digit growth to 15% growth fueled by voice AI customers (top 10 voice AI startups up 10x). MongoDB is benefiting from every AI company needing databases. Snowflake has re-accelerated. Stripe is booming from AI customers. Even if you can’t become Harvey, you must co-attach to the AI spend explosion. The window is closing fast. “You had 18 months to ship a product that mattered in this world. Where’s your agent? Where’s your reacceleration? F. No more excuses after Thanksgiving.” Despite the pricing pain, Jason argues Series A is in a golden age: “This is the best of times to be a series A investor because there is just an explosion of seed AI startups… It is a gift that thousands of founders are in San Francisco raising seed funds from multiple accelerators.” The top of funnel has never been better. YC, Neo, South Park Commons, and others are creating an unprecedented pipeline of smart, vetted founders. Yes, competition is fierce—Rory noted losing deals to Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins (firms that would have been “slightly early” five years ago). But the direction of travel is clear: “Some form of agentic software… The mission has been assigned.” Buried in the discussion of Navan’s “disappointing” IPO was a striking observation: “The amount of wealth in Silicon Valley is just unprecedented in our lifetimes. It’s just gone up dramatically the last 18 months. In a very concentrated fashion.” This creates a strange dynamic where VCs are getting richer than ever (Oren Zev as a solo investor turned $150M into $1B+, Lightspeed’s $257M became ~$1B) while simultaneously feeling the pressure to deliver even bigger outcomes. A $50M post-seed valuation for a company that “has to be way better than Navan” feels both expensive and necessary. Let’s dig deeper into why Navan’s $5B outcome feels bittersweet. The company survived a near-death experience (COVID wiping out travel), came back strong with $700M+ revenue at 32% growth, and delivered billions to investors. By any historical standard, this is spectacular. But the lockup period reveals the gap between headlines and reality. Typical lockup: 6 months before you can start selling, and 18-24 months to fully distribute a large position. As Rory explained: “The IPO, I mean, it’s significant, but the economic significance is limited.” Translation: Those “billion-dollar returns” reported on IPO day often turn into $700M after 18 months of distribution. Worse, the last private round priced at $9B. Anyone who bought at that valuation or in the IPO is now down 30-50%. As Rory noted, this actually disproves Bill Gurley’s “free money” thesis about IPO pops: “This is an example of an IPO where, you know, if you look at it from the perspective of the issuer of stock, not only did they not leave money on the table, they actually priced at what now looks like a high.” The follow-on concentration strategy amplified returns but also amplified late-stage risk. Lightspeed’s early rounds probably delivered 20-30x, but their $257M total investment (including heavy late-stage follow-on) blended down to ~4x. For Orin Zev’s smaller fund structure with SPVs, the $150M-to-$1B return (6.7x) on a single deal is phenomenal. Same outcome, different fund architecture, wildly different impact. One of the most insightful discussions centered on adoption velocity. OpenEvidence grew to 300,000 doctors in one year—one-tenth the time it took Doximity. Individual adoption of AI tools is explosive. But corporate adoption? Much slower. As Jason observed: “I don’t think everyone’s going to buy Agent Force or their equivalent in a year. It might be 5 years, not 10 like SaaS. It might be half the time of SaaS.” This creates opportunity and risk. Opportunity: If you’re selling to enterprises (Salesforce, HubSpot), you have 5 years to get this right, not 1 year. Risk: Individual users are already using ChatGPT, Cursor, and other tools “legally or illegally.” Every associate is using AI to write briefs whether law firms have adopted Harvey or not. The TAM question becomes critical. OpenEvidence might capture 300K doctors fast, but there are only ~1M doctors in America (half in-house, half external). As Rory warned: “You’ve got to be sure that once you get all the names that you have enough follow-on stories for those names. You don’t want to be one and done.” Harvey faces the same math. To justify an $8B valuation at 30% growth (7x multiple at maturity), they need to hit $3B in revenue. With ~1M lawyers in America, that implies thousands of dollars per lawyer per year in subscription—not impossible (WestLaw is bigger), but a high bar. Speaking of Harvey: $150M ARR, 98% GRR, 170% NDR, 40% DAU/MAU ratio, raised at $8B valuation with minimal dilution (~2% for $150M). Jason’s back-of-napkin math: “If it’s 400 forward revenue that’s 20x. That’s exactly what it is. 400 AR. That’s what they’re predicting.” Rory agreed: These low-dilution rounds at hypergrowth companies are great for early investors but create pressure on the ultimate exit. The bull case: LLMs are perfect for law (language manipulation is literally what lawyers do), Harvey established market leadership fast, and legal had been a “pretty barren place” for software until now. The question mark: Is there a $3B annual spend in software for corporate law practices? Rory’s framework: “You basically have to be such a big automation tool for these lawyers that they’re willing to spend, you know, equivalent dollars, you know, thousands of dollars per year in subscription to make the math work.” Jason’s evolution: “I couldn’t believe that software companies could really capture dollars from replacing humans for real… Now we’re really seeing it. Agents are better than mediocre humans.” His conviction comes from using products, not Powerpoints. He’s running 20+ agents at SaaStr, replacing $40K workers with $10K/year agents, and seeing real results. The discussion of Sam Altman’s response to Brad Gerstner (“if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find someone for you in 60 seconds”) revealed deep concerns about governance and capital requirements. Jason’s reaction: “When that was said to me by a founder, I never said a critical word ever again. I didn’t mean I didn’t realize I pushed too hard. I never said a critical word ever ever again when I was told there’s a market for your shares if you want to sell.” But Rory pushed back: “If you are on the board of a company that’s planning to spend a trillion dollars and you only have 12 billion in revenue. It’s a totally appropriate board level question to say how are we going to do this.” The stakes are enormous: “The health of the entire US economy depends on the answer to this question. It turns out ‘fuck off and sell your shares’ is not an acceptable answer.” OpenAI needs to do $100B+ in revenue by 2027 to support the capex commitments. That’s not just impressive—it’s “hundreds of billions of dollars a year in a world where today only Amazon” operates at that scale. Google does $100B in a quarter; so does Amazon. OpenAI needs to reach that level. Rory’s compassion for Sam: “There’s a little part of me that’s kind of a bit sorry for Sam Altman because of where he’s put himself. He is the poster child of the AI capex boom. And if the AI capex boom unravels and the world and media is looking for a villain to throw rocks at, it ain’t going to be a big search.” The board’s job: “Help the CEO avoid things… provide the guardrails.” When someone invents numbers at the $5-10M level and they’re wrong, they disappear. “When you invent numbers that are wildly overoptimistic at the trillion dollar level and if it unravels, you just become the poster child in every economic history for the next 200 years of the great AI crash of 2026.” AWS: Grew 20% (reacceleration from 13%), secured OpenAI deal as latest partner, but the story is bittersweet. Five years ago, AWS dominated cloud compute. Today, they’re behind Microsoft ($250B commitment), Oracle ($300B), Google, Broadcom ($400B) in the AI race. As Jason noted: “It’s tough from AWS being having really created the category of cloud and being what we all grew up on. It is a major come down to be not even above the fold on the leaderboard.” Google: The underappreciated winner. “Google is really good now at all levels. It’s really good at consumer AI. It’s really good in searches back. Search is growing for Google again. The TPUs are good. It’s a good partner.” Unlike Amazon, Google has the application layer (all the consumer apps we use), the infrastructure layer (TPUs), and is printing money. Stock up 53% from Q1 lows. Meta: Core business performed great (20% growth), but stock dropped double-digits because they’re spending $70B/year on AI with “no revenue attached.” The market’s message: “You have this wonderful business and then you’re taking the entire cash flow and you’re building this AI stuff and unlike Google, Microsoft, or Amazon you don’t have an enterprise business to sell this shit to and unlike ChatGPT you don’t yet have an obvious AI forward app.” Zuck’s response (paraphrased): “I think it’s relevant to be in this space. Thank you for your opinion. I refer you to the Artisan Corporation. I control this company. Have a nice day.” The market’s counter: “Hey you’re doing the thing you did in 2021-22 putting a whole bunch of capex into something that might not work and that’s why the shares are slightly down.” “If I were the CEOs of any of the CRM leaders, I might move on from half my leadership team if I don’t see real growth from AI agents by the middle of next year. Because there’s been enough time. You’ve just got the wrong people.” Why the urgency? Infrastructure companies like Twilio, MongoDB, and Datadog already saw the bump. Companies at the infrastructure layer get the AI spend first. Application layer companies need to prove they can capture it too—or risk being viewed as legacy players who missed the moment. Rory initially pushed back on Jason’s harshness, then came around: “Sometimes when Jason is cruel and harsh, I disagree. And then sometimes I listen and I go, he’s absolutely right. This is one of the latter ones… If you’re not on this train now, you’re just not going to be relevant and you will be sold for three times one-year revenues to a PE firm who will smush you in with something else, never to be seen again.” The contrast with Harvey is stark: Harvey has 2,000 people somewhere building legal AI. Salesforce has 2,000 people building Agent Force. One has 170% NDR and $150M ARR growing like a weed. The other needs to prove monetization in 2026 on a massive enterprise base. The ownership discussion revealed a fundamental tension in portfolio construction. Jason’s rule: “I feel like I can only make money if I own double digits of two winners per fund.” His last three investments: 6-8% despite that rule. His resolution for 2026: “Get my ownership up. We’ll see how I do it.” Rory’s framework on late-stage follow-on: Early-stage funds aim for one deal to return the fund. Late-stage funds play a different game: “We got 4 billion. We’re going to put it to work. The average good deal will be at 3 to 5x. We’ll have a low loss ratio and over time we’ll get our two two and a halfx net. It’s not small numbers of big heads business. It’s a very different business. It’s moving money at scale.” The challenge: When companies are capital-efficient, they don’t need to sell much equity. When they’re capital-inefficient (OpenAI, Anthropic), they need billions, so even $100M buys you only a few points. “Both of those, interestingly enough, would be pretty good deals… Your mental rules of thumb have been smashed to pieces.” Harry’s counter: “You have to turn the next card to see sometimes. And it’s not obviously a $10 billion company on day one. And actually value can accrue in increments over time. And you could miss some great ones by being flippant in being like, oh, it’s not a $10 billion company.” Jason’s response: “If your first check for me is a very large percent of the fund, I don’t have a lot of margin for error. I don’t have the other 145 million that he had in Trip Actions in Navan. For me, that first one has to work.” Jason’s most provocative statement: “I don’t even want to take meetings with mortal founders. I don’t even want to take them, especially if the ask is aggressive.” Context: At $50M post (with everything in), Jason needs a 100x return to make money after dilution. That company needs to be “even better than Navan” to justify the price. “Do I really believe this deal I just did is for sure going to be worth more than Navan? I don’t know. It’s such an insanely high bar.” Rory’s gentle pushback: “I recoil from the ‘I don’t do mortal humans.’ It’s a bit cuz I think, you know, it sounds a little judgy.” Jason’s clarification: “Maybe it was always hard but now like you got to see these 10 billion exits but if they’re not utterly breaking the mold… it’s hard to really believe it’s going to be worth north of 10 billion.” The sobering reality: “You now have to assume that 400 million, 500 million in revenue is the threshold for an IPO. And if you say to yourself that you only want to do deals where you at least have the upside of an IPO, the IPO potential, then the bar to what a doable successful venture-backed deal with upside has gone up.” Rory’s synthesis: “The business has got harder. It has. But also people are getting richer at the same time. The amount of wealth in Silicon Valley is just unprecedented in our lifetimes.” One of the most important exchanges revealed a dirty secret about modern venture boards. Jason: “The better the company is doing, the more everyone’s a grin fucker. There’s just never a critical word said.” His example: “I have a company that’s going batshit and it’s going too batshit… The board members will not intervene in any way to protect the shareholders because of the bad NPS that would come from damaging that founder relationship. That to me is one of the most egregious escapes from fiduciary duty.” Harry agreed: “There is so much fear among VCs of getting out of step with the most successful founders. There’s so much fear.” Rory’s take: “If it were a normal startup with the VCs we work with and they had had to come up with 1.2 trillion, I think everyone would be saying, ‘Sounds good, Sam. Sounds good, Sam. Keep going. Good month.'” The contrast with OpenAI’s actual board: Brett Taylor (likely not a yes-man) and previously Larry Summers (“Larry Summers is many things, but not a yes-man”). Having strong, independent voices matters enormously when the stakes are this high. Jason’s reflection on being told to sell by a founder: “That was a teaching moment for me. I’m like, okay, I crossed the line. Like I didn’t mean I didn’t realize I did.” But Rory’s point stands: “You’re as a board member meant to provide the guardrails. I think when I look at this one, I go, ‘Hm, I hope someone’s providing really good guard rails because if it hits, it’ll hit hard.'” The lesson: Young founders make mistakes, but experienced board members who stay silent are morally (if not legally) more culpable. “Do we really have an audit, Sam Bankman? Do we really know where the money is?” The episode crystallized two viable strategies for software companies navigating the AI transition: Path 1: Go Where Others Aren’t (The Roger Ehrenberg Strategy) As Harry noted: “Let’s go where others aren’t. Get 20% in actually reasonably priced assets. Let’s not do AI dictation tools from YC and get 4%.” This means finding categories with less competition, being willing to take concentrated positions, and having the patience to build ownership over time. The infrastructure layer companies (Twilio, Datadog, MongoDB) benefiting from AI spend without being “AI companies” exemplify this. Path 2: If You’re Slow, Pick Slower Categories Jason’s advice: “Only a couple percent of [Salesforce’s] customer base is fully ready for AI today… If you are a little slow, maybe play to your strengths. If you’re a little slow, maybe maybe go into retail or manufacturing or areas where it hasn’t changed overnight.” The key insight: Individual adoption is explosive (OpenEvidence to 300K doctors in a year). Corporate adoption takes 5 years, not 10, but still takes multiple years. If you’re a smaller team or moving slower, find industries where the decision-making process is naturally slower. But no matter which path you choose, the core message remains: You must be relevant to AI in 2026. Whether that’s replacing humans, automating tasks, or enabling AI workloads, you need a story. Companies without one will get “sold for three times one-year revenues to a PE firm” and disappear. The episode closed with a fascinating debate about prediction markets. Both agreed the space is interesting, but differed on which bet to take. Jason’s lean toward Kalshi: “Based on my limited knowledge, I’m going Kalshi because I feel like it is a safer long-term bet than someone that is riding the current political vibes which are all in favor of everything here.” The risk: “There is a chance there will be a new administration that will be less sympathetic to this category… The first act could be to undo everything everything that Sachs and Buddies have done. That could be the January 1st whatever.” Rory’s prediction: “I predict that any reregulation won’t happen because of any new administration. I think the real challenge to sports betting like this will actually be the leagues themselves wrestling with the fact that when you have sports betting, you have sports cheating.” The Brian Armstrong example: Using specific phrases during an earnings call to tilt the scales on a Kalshi bet creates all sorts of weird incentive problems. “When you have these prediction markets and then the person can tilt, put their finger on the scales of who wins… There’s going to be a lot of weird stuff that happens.” The broader point: Regulatory risk isn’t just about current administration views. It’s about second-order effects (league commissioners dealing with cheating scandals), insider trading concerns (policy bets moving an hour before official announcements), and the fact that “everything is legal” right now doesn’t mean it stays that way. Jason Lemkin: On the exit bar: “The horrible question in venture and startups, it is horrible. Is a $4.5 billion exit good enough today? It’s a horrible thing to say, but if we’re talking about in VC and inside baseball, it’s a bonafide question.” On AI urgency: “You better have gotten a few nickels out of the AI expenditures… If you didn’t, if you’re not growing faster at the end of 2025 than the start as a founder, I give you an F minus. There’s so much money and you don’t have to be Harvey to get a little piece of it.” Rory O’Driscoll: On ownership: “A founder’s optimized fundraising is a VC’s below ownership target. That’s right. If Cursor had needed 40 million to get rolling, then Reedrock would own 20%. If they only need 20 million, then there you are.” On Sam Altman: “There’s a little part of me that’s kind of a bit sorry for Sam Altman because of where he’s put himself. He is the poster child of the AI capex boom, right? And if the AI capex boom unravels and the world and media is looking for a villain to throw rocks at, it ain’t going to be a big search.” Harry Stebbings: On board dynamics: “There is so much fear among VCs of getting out of step with the most successful founders. There’s so much fear. And you guys are going to disagree with me, but I see it all across my portfolio. The better the company is doing, the more everyone’s a grin fucker. There’s just never a critical word said.” On adoption velocity: “OpenEvidence grew to 300,000 doctors in one year, which is one-tenth of the amount of time it took Doximity. That was interesting just in terms of market pull and adoption rate.” Final Thought: The venture landscape going into 2026 is simultaneously the most exciting and most unforgiving it’s ever been. Pricing is high, ownership is compressed, exit expectations are brutal, and the speed of AI adoption creates winners and losers faster than any previous technology shift. But for those who can navigate it—who can find the right companies, get meaningful ownership, help them capture AI spend, and provide real board-level guidance—the wealth creation is unprecedented. Just don’t expect it to be easy, and definitely don’t expect a $5B exit to feel like a win anymore.

Title: Elon Musk awarded nearly $1 trillion pay package by Tesla shareholders

WHIO 7 NOW Tesla shareholders awarded CEO Elon Musk a pay package on Thursday that could grant the tech entrepreneur nearly $1 trillion in compensation over the next decade. The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says. The compensation package also includes a set of production goals, including one million Robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of one million humanoid robots over the next 10 years, according to the securities filing. Before Tesla released the results of the shareholder vote, some major shareholders said they had voted down the proposal. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said Tuesday that it had voted against the pay package, raising concerns about its scale and potential risks. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management, the manager of the fund, said in a statement. (NEW YORK) -- Musk, considered the world's richest person, currently boasts a net worth of about $504 billion, according to Forbes. If he were to receive the full pay package, Musk would become the world's first-ever trillionaire. The pay package could also increase Musk's ownership stake in Tesla to as much as 29%. Musk has long pursued a larger ownership stake. “We are at a pivotal juncture in Tesla’s history, and the proposals the Special Committee has carefully designed and the Board has put forward will help determine Tesla’s future,” the company’s website said earlier this week. “If you believe, like us, that Elon is the CEO that can make our ambitious vision a reality, vote NOW.” Online voting among shareholders closed at 11:59 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The company's new compensation package arrives as Musk's previous payment plan remains in legal limbo. Last year, a Delaware judge twice struck down a $50 billion pay package for Musk put forward by the company in 2018. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, which litigates corporate governance litigation for companies incorporated in Delaware, initially declared that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and problematic influence by Musk over those negotiations. In a second ruling, McCormick decided that an additional shareholder vote on the compensation package -- even if made with full knowledge of the initial problems surrounding the negotiation of the agreement -- could not undo those problems. Musk has appealed the ruling. Tesla announced a 12% jump in revenue over the third quarter in October, snapping a streak of two consecutive quarters of falling sales. Still, earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations, causing a drop in the stock price. Overall, shares of Tesla have climbed about 16% this year, putting them roughly in line with a jump in the S&P 500 over that period. Musk's work as a “special government employee” with the Trump administration, which ended in May, set off demonstrations at Tesla dealerships worldwide in protest of his effort to slash government spending as leader of the Department of Government Efficiency. On an earnings call in June, Musk fielded a question about his control of the company, which a Morgan Stanley analyst said was 13%. "As I mentioned before, I think my control of Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out if I go crazy," Musk said in jest.

The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. Approval of the compensation package received more than 75% of the shareholder vote, Tesla General Counsel Brandon Erhart said during the shareholder meeting on Thursday. The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says.

Title: BlackRock eyes Australia as next Bitcoin ETF frontier – Details inside!

Why is the world’s biggest asset manager taking its Bitcoin ETF all the way to Australia? BlackRock is launching the iShares Bitcoin ETF on Australia’s ASX by mid-November 2025. It includes both a Bitcoin ETF and a global bond ETF, showcasing a diversified investment strategy. BlackRock is once again making headlines in the crypto space. This time, the firm is set to expand its digital asset footprint by launching the iShares Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) by mid-November 2025. With this move, Australia emerges as the next key frontier in BlackRock’s global crypto strategy, and one of the fastest-growing Bitcoin ETF markets outside the United States. That said, the upcoming ETF, which carries a 0.39% management fee, will mirror the U.S.-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust. This move would allow Australian investors to gain regulated exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding or managing the digital asset. BlackRock emphasized that its upcoming ETF is designed to provide investors with a cost-efficient and seamless way to access the cryptocurrency market. Importantly, it allows participation through traditional financial channels without the need to directly hold or manage Bitcoin. Furthermore, by entering Australia’s competitive Bitcoin ETF space, BlackRock joins established issuers such as Global X 21Shares (EBTC), VanEck (VBTC), Monochrome (IBTC), and DigitalX (BTXX). This strategic move is expected to enhance institutional participation and improve liquidity across the region’s growing crypto sector. For more perspective, BlackRock’s expansion in Australia extends beyond Bitcoin. This is because the firm will also launch the iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond (AUD Hedged) ETF (AGGG) in early November. This will offer a diversified exposure to investment-grade global bonds at a low 0.18% annual fee. All this highlights how, with time and tide, the institutional demand for Bitcoin is accelerating. Needless to say, for BlackRock, ETFs remain a major growth driver as its iShares division saw U.S.$153 billion in inflows last quarter, fueling total net inflows of US$205 billion. The firm also posted a 25% rise in revenue and 23% growth in operating income year-on-year, reflecting strong diversification and investor trust. In fact, despite current short-term outflows, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains strong, with a NAV of $59.04 and a 6.91% year-to-date return. Meanwhile, iShares ETFs have surpassed $50 billion in assets under management (AUM). Additionally, BlackRock’s (BLK) shares are also up 5.52% this year, trading at $1,073.57 and carrying a Zacks Rank 3 rating. All this shows that BlackRock’s IBIT has firmly cemented its dominance, driving both ETF inflows and options market sentiment.

Title: Laid off? Tech recruiting exec shares 4 tips for getting back on your feet—and on the job market
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/06/tips-for-when-you-get-laid-off/

It’s a day every IT pro dreads: hearing about layoffs within your company, then being summoned into an HR manager’s office and being dismissed. The tech industry is going through a purge. Earlier this week, IBM announced plans to layoff a portion of its workforce. Meanwhile, Amazon shared plans to axe 14,000 employees and Meta let go of 600 workers from its AI unit last month. After a layoff comes the uncomfortable question: “What’s next?” For most, it’s dusting yourself off and looking for a new opportunity. According to Overture Partners CRO Mark Aiello, that can be a grueling process. “Definitely no one ever went to bed on Sunday night saying, ‘Hey, I get to look for a new job. Tomorrow is going to be great!’” Aiello said. Dusting off the ol’ résumé. IT Brew caught up with Diana Huang, VP of technology staffing agency Prosum’s Southern California market, to learn how IT pros can make their job search less cumbersome, as well as proper résumé etiquette. Huang said one of the most important things an IT pro can do to improve their résumé is to demonstrate their accomplishments through numbers or other measurable metrics. “It could be ‘Reduced cloud spend by 15% through automation,’ or ‘Improved deployment frequency from weekly to daily,’” Huang said. “It’s adding numbers and specifics and showing your impact.” She added that professionals should make sure résumé details match what’s on their LinkedIn profile. A good résumé is also as concise as possible. “Don’t write a novel. No one’s going to read 15 pages,” Huang said. “Let’s try to really keep it short. If you’re more junior, five years [or] under, keep it [to] one page and try to keep it really concise.” Applicants are also working against applicant tracking systems, software used by hiring managers to filter and rank résumés by specified keywords or qualifications, according to Aiello, who added these “magic” algorithms can complicate things for job-seekers. “It’s more secret than anything the CIA does that they don’t explain, and you have to hope that you have the right keywords and the right weighting and all of that,” he said. Because of this, Aiello advises that applicants avoid using LinkedIn’s Easy Apply function and similar tools, and instead take time tailoring résumés to feature skills mentioned in the job descriptions of the desired role. “[Overusing Easy Apply] should mean ‘I like to be ghosted’…because that’s basically what’s going to happen to you,” Aiello said. He added that those who do feel inclined to use the function should do additional research and reach out to hiring managers separately. How to be a notable networker. Networking is also important when professionals are seeking a new opportunity, Aiello added. He said professionals seeking a new role should be specific when discussing their ideal role with their industry connections. “Don’t just say, ‘I’m looking for a job.’ Help them think exactly of what it is that you do in terms that they can understand,” he said. Emailing or texting similar job postings can help to illustrate what an IT pro is looking for. Huang suggests tech professionals build strong connections with a handful of local recruiters who specialize in IT. “If you’re able to have those strong relationships, they will give you access to opportunities that will give you a better chance, rather than just submitting an application and a lot of times turning into a black hole,” she said. She also advised professionals to announce that they are seeking work on LinkedIn and similar platforms. “I bet you a lot of people who would see that and have worked with you would be like, ‘Oh, I’m so sad to hear that, but I know of so and so who might be looking. Let me make that connection,’” Huang said. “So, don’t be afraid to broadcast that.” The golden rules of job hunting. Aiello said it is important for professionals to remember to maintain contact with networked connections, even after they land a new job. “If the only time you hear from your friend is when you need a ride to the airport or you need help moving after a while, they’re no longer going to be your friend,” he said. Huang added that job-seekers should let recruiters know if they lose interest in a position or leave the candidate pool altogether. “If you ghost, then you will be blacklisted out of their system, and they will not present you again to their clients.” This report was originally published by IT Brew. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Disaster Ensues After AI Behemoth Floats Idea Of Stealing Your Tax Dollars If They Fail

AI behemoth OpenAI tried to lay the groundwork for a taxpayer-funded bailout Wednesday and was met with swift condemnation. The Wall Street Journal published a story Sunday suggesting that OpenAI has now become “too big to fail.” In other words, if the company were to go under, it would be such a blow to the U.S. economy that the government would have to intervene and save it; otherwise, there might be a spiraling drain effect that sucks down the entire system. A domino effect from hell. OpenAI’s CFO, Sarah Friar, seemed to test-pilot the idea at a Wall Street Journal conference Wednesday, saying that the company wants to build up an ecosystem of banks, private equity groups, and a federal government “backstop” or “guarantee” to help build and finance the crucial data centers. (RELATED: Battle Against Data Centers Driving Up Electric Bills Unites Republicans, Democrats) There was swift backlash on social media, however, which forced OpenAI to do some cleanup. Friar later clarified her comment, saying that the mention of a “backdrop” muddied her point that “American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.” OpenAI wants federal taxpayer backstop for new investments, per Bloomberg. CFO has clarified this was a “misspeak.” — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) November 6, 2025 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a long statement Thursday on X, claiming they are not looking for “government guarantees,” or a handout from Uncle Sam. I would like to clarify a few things. First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or… — Sam Altman (@sama) November 6, 2025 “First, the obvious one: we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters. We believe that governments should not pick winners or losers, and that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions or otherwise lose in the market. If one company fails, other companies will do good work,” he said. Sam just wrote a 1,500-word essay explaining why he absolutely doesn’t want government guarantees… while outlining a $1.4 trillion moonshot that somehow needs them in spirit, if not on paper. It’s performance art at this point. 😂 He’s basically saying: “We don’t want… — Void Freud (@voidfreud) November 6, 2025 Altman went on to say that OpenAI has discussed government-subsidized loans to help build semiconductor factories in the U.S. “The one area where we have discussed loan guarantees is as part of supporting the buildout of semiconductor fabs in the US, where we and other companies have responded to the government’s call and where we would be happy to help (though we did not formally apply),” Altman said. “The basic idea there has been ensuring that the sourcing of the chip supply chain is as American as possible in order to bring jobs and industrialization back to the US, and to enhance the strategic position of the US with an independent supply chain, for the benefit of all American companies. This is of course different from governments guaranteeing private-benefit datacenter buildouts,” he goes on. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks joined the mop-up, as well. (Sacks is essentially Silicon Valley’s lobbying voice in the Trump White House.) There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 6, 2025 But, if there were a real market meltdown soon, why should we take these people’s statements that they don’t want a guaranteed federal bailout as true at face value? Clearly, they have been mulling over the idea. And it would be much easier to finance a mass buildout of data centers if investors knew that the federal government and taxpayers would ultimately foot the bill. In other words, if they knew the risk and downside of the whole AI bubble blowing up in their faces was passed on to the public. Altman recently got snappy when Brad Gerstner, an American investor, dared to ask him how OpenAI is going to pay for $1.4 trillion of long-term spending commitments on hardware and data center infrastructure from 2025-2035, even though the company’s revenue still is middling. “First of all. We’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer. I just, enough. I think there’s a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I think people who talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever, that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we could sell your shares or anybody else’s to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply,” Altman claimed. Of course, the “people who are making the most noise on Twitter about this” just seem to be those with common sense, an ability to do basic math, and a growing skepticism that AI technology will actually be worth the investment. One MIT study found that 95% of organizations that have tried to implement generative AI, like OpenAI’s technology, ChatGPT, got zero in return. Another study from the Rand Corporation revealed that 80% of AI implementations fail. All of it is beginning to reek of … ‘Just give me more money, and this time, there will be a major breakthrough, and it will all be worth it. The best is yet to come!’ I don’t know exactly how many times Altman and other tech CEOs have said something to this effect over the years, but I know it’s more than once. And something of note: the famous investor who shorted the U.S. housing market ahead of the 08/09 financial crisis, Michael Burry, now has a short position on tech behemoths Palantir and Nvidia. He’s betting that these stocks are overvalued and will soon crash. 🚨 BREAKING: Michael Burry goes short on $PLTR and $NVDA in his latest 13F filing Scion Capital just bought put options on 1M Nvidia shares and 5M Palantir shares 👀 The Big Short is feeling bearish on AI pic.twitter.com/Kn6EcINm20 — Michael Burry Stock Tracker ♟ (@burrytracker) November 3, 2025 News of the trade sparked a big selloff in tech, as speculation that AI is a bubble ready to burst is running rampant. That might explain why OpenAI tried to float the idea of the federal government and taxpayers funding their infrastructure. Sign up for John Loftus’s weekly newsletter here!

Title: Crypto Crash Recovery: XRP Price Surges on Strong Fundamentals, Outshining Bitcoin and Ethereum

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Following a stormy week that erased over $1 trillion in crypto market capitalization, signs of recovery are emerging, with the XRP price leading the way. While Bitcoin struggled to hold the $104,000 mark and Ethereum remained under pressure near $3,400, the XRP price rallied nearly 5% to trade around $2.31, outpacing both majors. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000 Analysts attribute this strength to robust fundamentals, including Ripple’s strategic partnership with Mastercard and renewed institutional interest following a $500 million investment round. The Mastercard collaboration marks one of the first instances of a U.S.-regulated bank testing real credit card transactions on a public blockchain through Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. The move underscores the growing shift from speculative crypto use cases to enterprise-grade payment infrastructure. Momentum also intensified after BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, Maxwell Stein, hinted at Ripple’s Swell conference that “trillions are definitely coming on-chain.” The comment reignited speculation around a potential BlackRock XRP ETF, a development that could reshape institutional exposure to the asset. Analysts note that such a product would provide regulatory recognition and attract billions in inflows, potentially revving the long-term value growth of the XRP price. The buzz comes as Ripple’s valuation climbs to $40 billion following its latest funding round, led by Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities. Major firms, such as Pantera Capital and Galaxy Digital, also joined, backing institutional confidence in Ripple’s blockchain-based payment systems. Observers say that this backing, blended with the growing utility of the network, positions XRP as a frontrunner for the next institutional adoption wave. Despite the broader market’s volatility, on-chain data reveals growing conviction among XRP holders. Glassnode reported that more than 1.4 billion XRP tokens have been withdrawn from exchanges since September, the fastest accumulation pace since 2022. Similarly, network activity surged, with over 21,000 new wallets created within 48 hours, marking the highest growth since January. This combination of reduced exchange supply, rising wallet creation, and expanding institutional partnerships paints a bullish picture for XRP’s medium-term trajectory. If the asset maintains support above $2.30, analysts expect a possible move toward the $2.60–$3.00 range. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash To $87,000 If This Happens As Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate, XRP’s growing real-world utility and corporate adoption suggest that the XRP price recovery may not just be a relief bounce, but the start of a new leadership phase in the next crypto cycle.

Future GLP-1 drugs will launch at a capped price of $149 under the terms of the agreement. For the first time, Medicare will cover GLP-1 drugs for obesity, with patient co-pays set at roughly $50. The administration also introduced a federal purchasing option that will allow consumers to buy GLP-1 drugs directly through a government website called “TrumpRX.” “Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have agreed to provide all of their other medications to Medicaid at 'most favored nations' prices, meaning you will pay the lowest price anywhere in the world,” President Donald Trump said during the press conference. Trump also highlighted the fact that the project bears his name. “They want to use my name, Trump. Better be good,” he said. “I think it’s turning out to be pretty amazing.” Trump added that the companies planned major U.S. manufacturing investments to support expanded supply, saying they “are building new plants” to produce GLP-1 medications domestically. GLP-1 drugs are a class of medications that mimic a natural hormone involved in regulating blood sugar and appetite. They were originally developed for diabetes, but have become widely used for weight loss because they slow digestion, reduce hunger, and help control blood glucose levels. Officials said the pricing changes were part of a broader effort to expand access to obesity and diabetes treatments. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) both jumped following the announcement, with LLY still recently up about 1% to $936, while NVO is down about 4% to $46 a share amid a broader daily decline for stocks. Administration officials said about 10% of Medicare beneficiaries would qualify for coverage under the new plan, based on criteria tied to body mass index and preexisting conditions such as prediabetes and cardiovascular disease. Eligible patients would pay a $50 monthly co-pay, with the change expected to take effect in the middle of next year. Officials also said some Medicaid enrollees could gain access to lower prices beginning in 2027 through a forthcoming pilot program run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Trump previewed his approach in February, telling Fox News, “The so-called fat drug or fat shot, whatever it’s called, Ozempic or Mounjaro—in London, you get it for $88. In New York, you get it for $1,200, you can’t even buy it. It’s very unfair… I’m going to solve it one way or the other.” Not present during the press conferences were representatives of major insurers, who did not say whether they would change their coverage rules in response to the new prices. Until now, plans have had limited access largely because of the high cost of the drugs and the large number of patients seeking them for weight-loss treatment. During the press conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agreement would broaden access for patients who had been unable to afford GLP-1 drugs. “Obesity is the number one driver of chronic disease. Fifty percent of our adult population are obese or overweight, and it drives about 50% of healthcare costs in this country,” Kennedy said. “We are going to see a decline because of this historic agreement. We’re going to see a decline in costs, but also, more importantly, in the afflictions themselves.” The negotiations took “months and months,” Kennedy added, and described the resulting deal as poised to provide “the biggest impact on the American people” among recent health policy moves. The administration did not say when commercial insurers might adjust their coverage policies. Officials said final implementation of the Medicare provisions would be completed after further review. “This is a great day for American health and health care,” President Trump said. “For all American patients, these are things that are miracles.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: AI wreaks havoc on US jobs with two-decade high 150K cut in October – bringing 2025 total to 1M: report

US employers axed about 153,000 workers last month — making it the worst October for layoffs in two decades and bringing total firings for the year so far to over 1 million, according to a new report that noted many companies blamed the latest layoffs on AI. The last time the US saw a worse October in terms of firings was in 2003, when 171,874 people were laid off. As in the aughts, the latest layoff numbers came amid a time of tech-driven realignment for the economy. Back then, the issue was changes in the telecom industry sparked by the rise of cell phones, experts say; today, it’s the advent of AI and automating tasks once done by humans. Companies cited artificial intelligence in 31,039 of the October layoffs — second only to general cost-cutting — according to the report Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” said Andy Challenger, the firm’s chief revenue officer. AI was explicitly blamed for relatively few of the total job cuts so far this year — just 48,414 of them, according to the data. October’s 153,074 job cuts marked a 183% spike from September — when 54,064 positions were slashed — and a 175% jump from the same month a year ago, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found. Analysts and businesses having been using the firm’s reports, which usually draw little notice, while official jobs data has stalled because of the government shutdown. Through the first 10 months of 2025, announced layoffs topped 1.09 million — a 65% increase from the 664,839 job cuts last year and the highest total since 2020, when pandemic shutdowns sent pink slips soaring. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Challenger. The data shows technology and warehousing companies led October’s cuts. Tech firms announced 33,281 layoffs, up sharply from 5,639 the prior month, while warehousing firms axed 47,878 jobs — a surge driven by automation and lingering overcapacity from pandemic-era expansion. For the year, the tech industry has slashed 141,159 jobs so far — up 17% from the 120,470 that were announced through the same period in 2024. The retail sector also remains under pressure, with 88,664 job cuts so far this year, up 145% from 2024, as chains face weaker discretionary spending and ongoing store closures. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October,” said Challenger. Warehousing, services, and consumer product firms also joined the retrenchment, while media and nonprofit organizations reported mounting losses tied to automation and reduced government funding. Challenger said nonprofits have announced 27,651 job cuts this year — up more than 400% — while the media industry logged 16,680, a 26% increase. Overall, companies cited cost-cutting in 50,437 October layoffs, followed by artificial intelligence, market conditions and facility closures. The layoffs seem unlikely to stop anytime soon. Amazon, Target, Paramount Skydance and Starbucks have each moved to cut hundreds or thousands of positions, underscoring the breadth of the corporate pullback heading into the holidays. Amazon said last week it will eliminate about 14,000 corporate roles, part of a reorganization to “further reduce bureaucracy” and shift resources toward artificial intelligence. At Target, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke announced the company’s first major layoffs in a decade, cutting 1,800 corporate jobs — roughly 8% of its headquarters staff — as the retailer struggles with a sales slump and aims to “simplify how we work.” UPS recently announced it would lay off 48,000 workers as part of a sweeping cost-cutting initiative. In Hollywood, Paramount Skydance began cutting about 2,000 positions, or 10% of its workforce, following its merger approval earlier this year. Starbucks filed notice to Washington state regulators that it will lay off 974 employees in Seattle and Kent starting Dec. 5. The non-retail layoffs follow earlier cuts across Washington State as CEO Brian Niccol restructures the company after a post-pandemic downturn. Even as layoffs accelerate, hiring plans have slowed dramatically. Employers have announced 488,077 planned hires through October — down 35% from last year and the lowest year-to-date figure since 2011. Seasonal hiring has also cratered, with just 372,520 positions announced so far, the weakest pre-holiday total since Challenger began tracking the figure in 2012. “At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable,” Challenger said. “Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” Advertisement

Title: Is the AI boom losing steam as investors grow wary of returns?

Billions have poured into AI, helping stock valuations soar. But the cracks are starting to show. Slowing adoption, surging costs and elusive profits are fueling warnings that the boom may be headed for a hard reset. The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent. Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030. Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations. But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits. Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting. "The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer," Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW. "Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst." The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video AI’s biggest challenge remains its tendency to hallucinate — generating plausible but false information. Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time. "Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances," said Frey. As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade. In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month. "What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI," economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW. Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September. Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are "charging far less than they need to make a profit" and should raise subscription prices. Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI — despite little evidence of sustainable returns — dwarfs previous speculative frenzies. "We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP — four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust," Garran told DW. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability. That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses. "The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production," he told DW. Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion. "With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped," Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. "My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense." Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up. "They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall," Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is "skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better." Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a "market correction" in AI, rather than a "cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'" After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus "shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact." "More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns," she added. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

US stock market crash deepened Thursday as AI overhype fears collided with bleak jobs data. Dow Jones fell 0.8%, S&P 500 dropped 0.9%, and Nasdaq tumbled 1.6%. Challenger data showed 153,074 layoffs in October — the worst since 2003. Qualcomm sank 4%, AMD lost 6%, and Nvidia dropped 2%. Tesla’s trillion-dollar pay vote loomed large. The selloff reflected growing doubts about inflated tech valuations. With job cuts rising 44% this year, investors fear the AI rally is cracking.

Title: OpenAI’s Government Lifeline: A $1T Ask Amid Wall Street’s AI Doubts

Our goal is to help readers make informed decisions. Read more. Key Takeaways OpenAI has reportedly requested U.S. government loan guarantees to support what could become one of the largest private infrastructure buildouts in history, an AI expansion valued at more than $ 1 trillion. The plan also aligns with OpenAI’s broader effort to reduce its dependence on Nvidia’s costly GPU ecosystem, as it explores alternative financing and chip-sourcing strategies to sustain its trillion-dollar expansion into large-scale AI infrastructure. The timing is notable. While OpenAI seeks federal backing, segments of Wall Street are growing cautious about the sustainability of the AI rally. Hedge fund manager Michael Burry has reportedly taken substantial put positions against Nvidia and Palantir, betting on a correction in overextended AI equities. Meanwhile, banks such as Deutsche Bank are exploring hedges against their data-center exposure, anticipating a possible cooling period in AI infrastructure spending. It marks a clear divergence between Silicon Valley’s aggressive capital expansion and Wall Street’s tightening risk appetite—a contrast that could define the next phase of the AI investment cycle. Since its launch, OpenAI has attracted substantial private and corporate investment, led by its deep partnership with Microsoft. That backing has helped fuel its rapid expansion in both research and cloud-based AI services. Now, however, the company’s ambitions extend beyond traditional venture and corporate funding. OpenAI is pursuing federal loan guarantees, effectively positioning its AI infrastructure strategy as a public-private partnership. The move would shift part of the financial burden and risk of scaling artificial intelligence from private investors to the U.S. government, marking a significant evolution in how frontier technology projects are financed. At a recent conference, CFO Sarah Friar said the company is building “an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental” participants. In a typical scenario, technology companies raise debt through private markets, paying interest rates that reflect their credit risk. OpenAI’s proposal departs from that model. By seeking a federal loan guarantee, the company would transfer much of the default risk from lenders to the U.S. government. This backing would allow OpenAI to borrow at significantly lower rates and negotiate higher loan-to-value terms, reducing the overall cost of capital for its ambitious infrastructure plans. According to OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, government participation could “materially lower the cost of financing” while broadening the base of lenders willing to fund the project. For policymakers and taxpayers, the optics are complicated. A private technology firm seeking state-backed financing to build infrastructure that could accelerate automation (and potentially displace jobs) poses a political and ethical dilemma. Analysts have compared OpenAI’s proposal to historical frameworks, such as the Defense Production Act and Department of Energy loan programs, which supported the early electric vehicle and solar sectors. The difference this time lies in the asset class: AI infrastructure, not physical manufacturing. If the plan proceeds, the financial risk would be borne by the public, rather than the venture capital community that traditionally funds frontier technology. By tying its AI build-out to federal support, OpenAI is effectively redefining the boundary between public and private investment in computing infrastructure, hinting at a state–Silicon Valley hybrid model for the next era of technological expansion. In recent filings and market moves, the relentless AI bull run is starting to show visible signs of losing steam. Two very different actors are showing varying degrees of scepticism about the AI boom’s outlook: one a famed contrarian investor, and the other a multinational bank with significant exposure to the hardware boom. According to Scion Asset Management’s Q3 2025 13F filing, hedge fund manager Michael Burry has taken substantial put option positions against Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR), with a combined notional value of roughly $1.1 billion. These bearish bets account for approximately 80% of Scion’s disclosed U.S. equity portfolio, indicating a strong conviction that the current AI rally may have extended beyond its fundamentals. Burry’s positioning suggests he expects a significant correction in both AI hardware and software valuations, a contrarian view amid the sector’s explosive growth. However, it’s worth noting that 13F filings don’t include cash or foreign holdings, meaning Scion could be holding sizable reserves outside of its reported U.S. equity positions. Still, Burry’s track record invites caution in interpretation. His legendary short against the U.S. housing market in 2008 proved highly profitable but was long-dated and capital-intensive, requiring substantial collateral to maintain open positions. More recently, in 2023, Burry expressed a bearish outlook on social media platform X just before a major market rebound, a call he quietly deleted afterward. The takeaway? Undoubtedly, there is a risk that the AI bubble could pop. However, timing it correctly is the risky part; the market may well run a lot higher before a meaningful downturn. On a different front, Deutsche Bank is quietly rebalancing its exposure. The bank is reportedly exploring hedges and short baskets targeting AI-linked stocks and data center debt, as it evaluates its exposure to multibillion-dollar financing for compute infrastructure. With lenders themselves beginning to hedge their bets, the frenzy that only recently dominated AI investment may be beginning to morph into something more measured and cautious. OpenAI’s request for government-backed loan guarantees raises questions that go far beyond corporate finance. If Washington agrees to underwrite even a portion of a $1 trillion AI infrastructure plan, it would mark a defining shift for the industry, the point at which advanced computing transitions from a private enterprise to a state-subsidized utility. Economists warn that data centers and GPUs depreciate significantly faster than traditional infrastructure, creating a mismatch between the short lifespan of these assets and the long-term liabilities that taxpayers may be asked to support. Supporters counter that such a partnership could represent a digital-era form of industrial policy, ensuring U.S. leadership in AI and artificial general intelligence before global competitors, particularly China and emerging state-backed players in the Middle East, can scale comparable systems. The push reflects not just the scale of infrastructure but also a shift in how AI is delivered, from strictly enterprise systems to increasingly personalized, user-facing models that are being tailored for everyday interaction, featuring modular personalities and adult-mode customization. Critics, however, see a familiar pattern emerging: socialized risk and privatized rewards. Either way, the proposal forces a deeper question for the decade ahead — can the AI revolution sustain itself on private capital alone, or has it already grown too big to fail?

Title: No Brainer Dividend Stocks To Buy Now
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/11/06/no-brainer-dividend-stocks-to-buy-now/

Investing Realty Income (O) reported $1.08 FFO per share in Q3 with revenue up 10.5% year-over-year to $1.47B. United Parcel Service (UPS) plans to generate $3.5B in cost savings while focusing on high-margin areas. Pfizer (PFE) raised full-year EPS guidance to $3.00-$3.15 and targets $7.7B in net cost savings by 2027. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. You cannot know the power of an investment unless you see the returns. Many think of dividend stocks as a way of generating cash income from their portfolio, but if you handle the income well, you can generate a higher total return through dividend reinvestment while boosting the long-term capital appreciation potential. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and Realty Income (NYSE:O) are no-brainer dividend stocks to own right now. If you’re chasing long-term growth, you need to make dividend stocks an important part of your portfolio. They’re reliable, have an upside potential, and generate regular income. However, when picking dividend stocks, quality matters more than quantity. Here’s why they are no-brainer stocks that stand out in the industry. Realty Income is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that has a history of 112 consecutive quarterly dividend increases. This means about 28 years of quarterly dividend increases. The company takes pride in calling itself “The Monthly Dividend Company” since it pays monthly dividends and has a yield of 5.5%. Realty Income owns properties across the globe and has triple net leases on them. This allows the company to ensure steady rental income while keeping the operating costs at a minimum. The insurance, taxes, and maintenance costs are borne by the tenants, allowing the REIT to generate a higher cash flow and sustain dividends. In the third quarter results, the funds from operations (FFO) stood at $1.08 per share, and the revenue came in around $1.47 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year. The management has adjusted the full year guidance upwards and has a positive outlook for future growth. It has an occupancy rate of 98.7%, signalling confidence towards the business. During the quarter, it invested $1.36 billion across 123 properties and properties under development. Realty Income has a payout ratio of 75.29% and has an annual payout of $3.23 per share. Exchanging hands for $56.12, Realty Income stock has gained 6.6% in 2025 but has lost value over the last six months. This dip is a buying opportunity for income investors. RBC Capital has a price target of $61 with an Outperform rating. iStock Unreleased via Getty Images Logistics company United Parcel Service is known for the high yield and sustainable dividends. It has a juicy yield of 7.06% and has raised dividends for 16 consecutive years. Exchanging hands for $92, UPS is a solid buy below $100. The stock has lost 25% value in 2025 and has gone from the 52-week high of $138 to $92 today. Despite the dip, the dividend isn’t under any threat. United Parcel Service has increased dividends for over a decade, and while the future dividend growth may slow down, the payout rate will remain secure. UPS has seen a dip in earnings due to tariffs and inflation. However, the management has laid out a plan to generate $3.5 billion in savings. It is also focusing on high-margin areas and has reduced Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) deliveries. This could lead to margin expansion in the long term, allowing UPS to maintain the dividend growth streak. The company managed to beat estimates in the recently announced third-quarter results. Its revenue came in at $21.4 billion, while the EPS stood at $1.74. It reported a net income of $1.31 billion and expects fourth quarter revenue of $24 billion. The company has reduced the workforce significantly and is looking for other ways to cut costs. United Parcel Service has a payout ratio of 86.99%, and the annual payout is $6.56. It has a 5-year dividend growth rate of 10.42%, and its cash flow supports the dividend payout. I think the company’s turnaround has just begun, and there’s a lot more upside potential. It is a high-yield stock trading at a discount. Alexandros Michailidis / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Pfizer Inc. is slowly bouncing back and gaining traction. The company beat estimates in the third quarter results, and despite the fall in income, the management raised full-year guidance. It reported a revenue of $16.6 billion and an EPS of $0.87, down 18% year over year. This drop was due to the one-time adjustment towards a licensing deal with 3SBio. Pfizer is working on cost reduction measures to improve margins. It aims to achieve net cost savings of $4.5 billion by the end of 2025 and $7.7 billion by the end of 2027. The cost savings will be invested towards research and development for improving the pipeline programs. The management expects the full-year EPS in the range of $3 to $3.15, up from the previous outlook of $2.90 to $3.10. The company is in a clash for Metsera with Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO). Pfizer was set to acquire Metsera for $4.9 billion, which could give it a golden ticket to enter the obesity market. However, Novo Nordisk bid at $6 billion, triggering a bidding war. Pfizer has upgraded its bid to $8.1 billion. Pfizer is seeing high demand for its recent launches and acquired drugs, and the growth from these products could help offset the looming patent cliff losses. The management remains committed to dividend and will be working to improve shareholder value. Pfizer has a payout ratio of 13.13% and an annual dividend of $1.72. It has reported a 5-year dividend growth of 3.77%.

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth was reduced by nearly $5 billion as Meta shares declined on Thursday, dropping him among the ranks of the world’s wealthiest after Reuters reported Meta projected a chunk of revenue would come from running advertisements for scams. Shares of Meta dropped 2.3% to around $620.75 as of Thursday morning, adding to a roughly 17.5% slide for the stock over the last week, which includes a single-day drop of more than 11% after Meta posted third-quarter earnings. Zuckerberg, who was ranked the world’s third-richest person early last week behind Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($298.8 billion) and Tesla’s Elon Musk ($496.5 billion), respectively, now ranks behind No. 3 Jeff Bezos ($257 billion), No. 4 Larry Page ($235 billion) and No. 5 Sergey Brin ($217.9 billion). Zuckerberg, who holds roughly 13% equity in Meta, had his net worth reduced by $4.6 billion (2.1%) as Meta’s shares dropped. Reuters reported Thursday, citing internal company documents, that Meta projected 10% of overall revenue—estimated at $16 billion—would come from running advertisements for scams and banned goods. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters the documents cited by the outlet “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams,” noting the company’s internal estimates were lower and that the 10% estimate included “many” legitimate ads.” Stone declined to give an updated figure to Reuters (Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Forbes). Other documents indicated Meta was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for running ads for financial scams, Reuters reported. Regulators in the U.K. reported in 2023 that Meta’s products were involved in 54% of all payment-related scam losses that year, more than double all other social platforms combined.

Title: For Gen Z, it’s ‘not enough to work hard’ if you want to succeed, says Jamie Dimon—specific skills are the way to get ahead

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning senior reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. For many years, the rule of thumb was that working hard will guarantee some level of success. But according to Wall Street veteran Jamie Dimon, for the generations now entering the workforce, hard work alone won’t cut it. In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, successful individuals will have to be armed with the tools needed in specific sectors. “When you graduate, whether it’s high school, or community college, or college, you need the skills to get the job,” Dimon said in a recent interview with CNN. “It’s not enough anymore to say, ‘I can work hard.’ In the old days, you could be in 10th grade, go get a factory [job] in Detroit, and eventually you could afford a family, a home, a car, and that may not be true anymore.” Dimon’s words will resonate with many. Even in the past few years, buying a home has become increasingly unaffordable for first-time buyers. Per data from the National Association of Realtors, in 2022 its housing affordability index stood at 108, with a value of 100 representing a family with the median income having exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. By 2025, this had dropped to 97.4, meaning the average American family trying to buy their first home doesn’t have the income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. Likewise, childcare costs have skyrocketed compared with a few decades ago. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis charting tuition, school fees, and childcare across an average of U.S. cities has increased from an index of 100 in 1983 to 897 by September 2025. In the face of an increased cost of living, younger workers now graduating and entering the workforce are more concerned than their older counterparts about the threat of artificial intelligence. Nearly one in five Gen Z workers reported being deeply worried that artificial intelligence will put them out of work within the next two years, according to a recent survey from Deutsche Bank Research. But their older peers are notably less alarmed: While nearly a quarter of young adults ages 18 to 34 gave high scores of concern on a 0 to 10 scale, only about one in 10 baby boomers and Gen Xers (ages 55 and above) expressed comparable anxiety. Dimon said that AI and coding are areas where “we know we need the skills,” adding that speedy industry training courses also present paths to secure employment: “And it works, those things work. We just have to get people to invest in them.” Many of the nation’s fastest-growing job markets are in highly specialized sectors—some of which require no degree but do require technical training. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projections for job growth in 2023–33, released last year, wind turbine service technicians came in first with a growth rate of 60% and median annual pay of just under $62,000. No degree is required. Second was solar photovoltaic installers with a growth rate of 48% and annual pay of a little under $49,000—again, no degree required. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also urged job market entrants to explore skills-focused roles adjacent to the immediate technology sector. While the billions being invested into AI have pushed up valuations courtesy of promised efficiencies and streamlining, Huang points out that it will also have real-world impacts when it comes to building data centers and the wider infrastructure needed to support the shift. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the U.K. in September. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.” Huang isn’t alone. Earlier this year BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an energy conference he has warned the White House about the shortage of workers needed to support the rollout: “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel Says Bitcoin Upside Is Limited Following BlackRock And Government Interest

PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has issued a grim forecast for Bitcoin, predicting a volatile and bumpy ride for the leading cryptocurrency. Thiel noted that Bitcoin’s upside is limited, given the heavy institutional and government interest, underscored by the introduction of ETFs and strategic reserves. Amid the flurry of predictions for Bitcoin’s end-of-year price, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has dampened investors’ enthusiasm with a grim forecast. Thiel warned that Bitcoin does not have much upside left in terms of pricing after its last bull run, citing institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency. Thiel shared his thoughts at a session at the Aspen Ideas Festival, urging investors to brace for a rocky patch with the leading cryptocurrency. The PayPal co-founder added that while a BTC rally is on the horizon, investors may not see the parabolic returns from the last bull run. “I’m not sure it’s going to go up dramatically from here,” said Thiel. “We got the ETF edition, and I don’t know who buys it quickly from here.” Despite not forecasting sizable returns, Thiel forecasted a volatile run for BTC, marked by steep corrections and price surges. During his sit-down at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the billionaire hinged his argument on the influx of institutional players via ETFs, name-checking Larry Fink’s BlackRock. Thiel highlighted an ideological shift in Bitcoin from its cypherpunk ideals, marked by privacy, decentralization, and stiff resistance to government control. However, a flurry of Bitcoin treasury companies, institutional asset managers, and governments launching strategic reserves with the asset have forced Thiel to lower his price target. The PayPal co-founder revealed that he still holds a small portion of BTC in his portfolio, reiterating his regrets for underinvesting in the asset. While Peter Schiff has issued a bleak forecast for BTC, several experts are bucking the trend with bullish projections. Strategy founder Michael Saylor is eyeing an end-of-year BTC price of $150,000 while making a strong case for a $1 million valuation before the end of the decade. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also predicted a BTC price of $1 million, but did not disclose a timeline for the asset to reach seven figures. Meanwhile, Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is dead, noting that the sharp declines and parabolic rallies will be few and far between.

Title: October Layoffs the Worst Since 2003

Time Published: 2025-11-06T15:15:00Z
Full Content:
Layoffs in the US have reached recession-level numbers, reports the Washington Post, which cites new data from the private firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas to back that up: So far this year, employers have announced 1.1 million job cuts, a figure in line with the Great Recession of 2008-09, and the biggest number since the pandemic. Layoffs are up 65% over last year, per Reuters. October alone saw more than 153,000 cuts—a 183% jump from the previous month, per the Post—making it the worst October for layoffs since 2003. "We're entering new territory with these layoffs in October," says John Challenger, the firm's CEO. "We haven't seen mega-layoffs of the size that are being discussed now—48,000 from UPS, potentially 30,000 from Amazon—since 2020 and before that, since the recession of 2009." The hardest-hit sectors include technology, retail, warehousing, and service. Technology firms, in particular, have cited the disruptive impact of artificial intelligence as a factor, with tech layoffs up 17% from last year. Despite the spike in layoffs, the broader economy appears stable for now, per the Post. The most recent official data puts the unemployment rate at 4.3%, though economists warn that conditions could deteriorate quickly. In fact, the rate is expected to reach 4.5% in the coming months, per CBS News.

Layoffs in the U.S. rose sharply in October 2025 as companies tried to save money and adjust to new AI technology. Many big firms, including tech companies, reduced jobs. Experts say rising costs and slower spending are also reasons for the cuts, making it harder for people to find new work this year.

Title: Monthly job cuts surged to a 22-year high in October

BREAKING: Former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue dies at 84 news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time U.S.-based companies announced more than 153,000 job cuts in October, the research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday. “This is the highest total for October in over 20 years, and the highest total for a single month in the fourth quarter since 2008," the firm said in a news release. From January through the end of October, employers have announced the elimination of nearly 1.1 million jobs. It's the most Challenger has recorded since 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the global economy. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month," Andy Challenger, the firm's chief revenue officer, said in a statement. The last time there was a higher October monthly total was in 2003. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” he said. On Wednesday, the private payroll processor ADP released its own October jobs data, showing that employers added just 42,000 jobs in the month. The ADP report also flagged job losses in the leisure and hospitality sector as a potential sign of trouble ahead, given the industry’s acute sensitivity to consumer sentiment. ADP's chief economist called the losses in hospitality and leisure a "concerning trend." Both Challenger and ADP's reports landed as major companies such as Amazon, IBM, UPS, Target, Microsoft, Paramount and General Motors announced plans to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. Despite the wave of downbeat economic news, the Trump administration continues to deliver an upbeat take on the current environment. “Jobs are booming” and “inflation is falling,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. However, the most recent available data paints a different picture. Inflation has also been on the rise. Prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index overall have risen every month since April. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the Challenger report. Challenger’s report does not typically carry the same weight with economists and investors as federal jobs data, owing to its methodology. To arrive at its figures, the firm compiles the number of job cuts companies have publicly announced. But employers may not ultimately carry out all the cuts they roll out. Moreover, some of the job cuts that multinational companies announce could affect workers outside of the United States. Other headcount reductions could be achieved through attrition, rather than layoffs. The report also may not capture smaller layoffs over the long run. But in the midst of a federal data blackout caused by the government shutdown, Challenger’s latest report is being read more closely than usual. The federal government's October jobs report that would traditionally be released Friday will not be published this week, due to the shutdown. Other key data about the U.S. economy like GDP and an inflation indicator called PCE, closely watched by the Federal Reserve, has also been delayed. Challenger equated the impact of AI on the current labor market to the rise of the internet in the early aughts. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” it said. "Technology continues to lead in private-sector job cuts as companies restructure amid AI integration, slower demand, and efficiency pressures," Challenger said. But even firms that are not actively cutting jobs have warned that they do not plan to add to their headcount in the near term, with several pointing directly to AI’s impact on their personnel needs. On Wednesday night, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN that headcount at his company would likely remain steady as the nation's largest bank rolls out AI internally. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also recently told his employees that the firm would "constrain headcount growth through the end of the year," as it takes advantage of AI efficiencies, Bloomberg reported.

Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S.-based employers cut more than 150,000 jobs in October, marking the biggest reduction for the month in more than 20 years, a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday as industries adopt AI-driven changes and intensify cost cuts. Tech firms led the job cuts in the private sector, followed by retailers and the services sector, the global outplacement company said. Cost-cutting was the top reason for the layoffs in October, followed by artificial intelligence, while “DOGE Impact” was the leading reason for job cuts in 2025. The layoffs in October surged 175% from a year ago to 153,074. From the start of the year to October end, employers have announced 1,099,500 job cuts, a 65% rise from 664,839 in the same time period last year. So far this year, job cuts are at the highest level since 2020 when 2,304,755 cuts were announced through October. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes,” said Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Not only did individual companies announce large layoffs in October, but a higher number of companies announced job cut plans, Challenger said, tracking nearly 450 individual job cut plans in October compared to under 400 in September. Any economic data from private sources will be on investors’ radar as official data continues to be absent with the U.S. government now entering its longest-ever shutdown.

Δ That’s a 175% jump from October of 2024 and 183% higher than the 54,064 cuts announced in September of this year, per a Thursday (Nov. 6) report by outplacement and executive coaching company Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month,” Andy Challenger, workplace expert and the company’s chief revenue officer, said in a news release. “Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market.” The report also notes that October’s total is the highest for that month since October of 2023, which saw a surge of layoffs in the retail space because of acquisitions, and in telecommunications as cell phones became more popular. “Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,” said Challenger. “Over the last decade, companies have shied away from announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter, so it’s surprising to see so many in October.” Advertisement: Scroll to Continue He added the onset of social media has allowed workers to share their negative work experience, meaning the trend of announcing layoffs before the holidays faded away, “a practice that seemed particularly cruel.” Among the companies cutting jobs last month was Amazon, which said it planned to eliminate up to 30,000 corporate roles. The report comes one day after the announcement of planned Senate legislation that would require major companies and federal agencies to report artificial intelligence-related layoffs, hires, job displacements, retraining and other impacts to the Labor Department. The bill would also require the DOL to compile data on AI-related job effects and publish a report to Congress and the public, according to a press release issued Wednesday (Nov. 5) by the bill’s sponsors, Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Mark Warner, D-Va. Meanwhile, research from the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Generation AI: Why Gen Z Bets Big and Boomers Hold Back” found that among people who use generative AI, 33% are worried that the technology might threaten people’s jobs. That concern is most pronounced among Generation Z, with 38% of the gen AI users in that age bracket worried about the impact on employment. The report said Gen Z users tend to have — or are looking for — the types of entry-level jobs that the technology can most easily replace.

Title: AI fatigue detected: 4 recent developments show the stock market's driving engine is at a crossroads

Every time Joe publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. The Supreme Court is skeptical about President Trump's tariffs. It's still early innings, but watch this space for what this means about the future of the market. Rundown But first, traders are getting tired. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings The old saying goes that something happening once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, and three times is a pattern. Given developments in the AI space in recent days, it looks like we have a full-fledged pattern of skepticism. It's created an inflection point of sorts for a trade that seemed unstoppable as recently as last Tuesday, the last time the S&P 500 closed at record highs. Yes, stocks are coming off a strong day, but it feels like something has shifted under the surface. While three makes a pattern, I'll do you one better. Detailed below are four examples of AI exhaustion, in reverse chronological order, dating back one week: 1. Michael Burry comes out of hibernation to short some giants If Burry is emerging from the woodwork, you know something is afoot. The legendary "Big Short" investor dusted off his X account this week to compare the AI boom to the dot-com bubble. He also disclosed short wagers against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir. While Burry has made a series of bearish bets in recent years that haven't come to fruition, he certainly knows his way around an unsustainable bubble, and his views are an important contribution to the broader groundswell. 2. Sky-high valuations suddenly matter When Wall Street CEOs gathered at an investment summit in Hong Kong this week, few expected the high-profile guests to take a two-by-four to bullish stock portfolios. But that's exactly what Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon did. They warned of a 10-20% drawdown in equities, characterizing it as a necessary and normal consolidation. In a different environment, the comments might've passed without incident. But with investors starting to question AI valuations, it confirmed some latent worries. On this same subject… 3. Palantir sells off big after crushing every conceivable earnings metric A record quarter? Meh. An increased profit forecast? Yawn. All anyone seemed to care about after Palantir's third-quarter earnings was how absurd the company's valuation was, with the stock up 174% year to date. The actual results rendered were irrelevant, offering a clear sign of exhaustion, and a desire from investors to regroup and reassess. 4. Meta's AI-spending pledge sends its stock tanking Loyal readers of First Trade will recognize this as a familiar trope that's been mentioned a handful of times already. Well, it really is that big of a deal. You know the story by now: Meta — already spending tens of billions on AI — said it plans to spend even more in 2026. That might've excited investors a few months ago, but this time around the forecast landed with a thud, and the stock tumbled. The message from investors was clear: we want tangible results, not an opaque money pit. Not convinced? Allow me to offer a visual aid that's specific to OpenAI's role in the fervor. The headline takeaway from this chart is how much Oracle's stock has come back down after a 36% single-day spike on Sept. 10, which was driven by giant new AI-cloud deals and the future revenue they could bring. That day, Oracle announced almost half a trillion dollars in new cloud contracts. A big chunk of that was from an OpenAI deal to develop data-center capacity. OpenAI essentially played kingmaker, as it has so much lately. Since then, OpenAI has unveiled a string of other giant AI infrastructure agreements. With doubts creeping in about OpenAI's ability to pay for all this, investors are discounting these deals. Hence the drop in Oracle shares. This recurring section will highlight individuals who have dominated the week in markets. This week's First Trade MVP is Miriam Adelson, the widow of Sheldon Adelson, founder and chairman of the casino company Las Vegas Sands, of which she and her family own a half-stake. This week's entry would be more aptly titled "MVP of the past two weeks," because LVS has been on a 24% tear over that period, since earnings after the closing bell on Oct. 22. That includes a 5% increase this week. LVS beat revenue forecasts, and saw especially strong growth at its Marina Bay Sands resort, which contributed to a 56% year-over-year sales increase for Singapore operations. The move has lifted Adelson's net worth to $39.9 billion, making her (and her family) the 45th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes data. And did I mention that she's the majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks? No word on how she feels about trading Luka Dončić for pennies. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. One of the biggest questions in the market right now is how effective AI will be in raising profit margins. Tech firms are dumping tens of billions of dollars a year into building out infrastructure to support the technology, helping to propel US economic growth and stock-market gains. But will it ever pay off? For one company, the answer is already yes. And its stock is already seeing the benefits in a big way. Shares of CH Robinson (CHRW), a freight logistics firm, are up 49% year-to-date. After the company's third-quarter earnings report last week, the stock jumped about 20% in a single day. The stock is moving so dramatically because the company has begun using generative AI, said Travis Prentice, the founder of the Informed Momentum Company. AI is able to provide price quotes, book appointments, respond to emails, and process orders for the firm, allowing its shipments per person per day to have increased by 40% since 2022. Meanwhile, CH Robinson has reduced its employee base by more than 10%, boosting margins amid a 12% decline in expenses. "Not the most sexy business in the world, but when everyone talks about AI and there's no ROI with AI, this is a massive exception to the rules," Prentice told BI. "It's driving productivity gains of like 40-50%." "That's a story that no one's really talking about — AI is actually improving business operations," he continued. "They're one of the outliers, but I'm sure there's gonna be a lot to follow when they see the gains that they're having." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago.

Title: AI open letter by Amazon workers
URL: https://www.amazonclimatejustice.org/open-letter
Time Published: 2025-11-06T12:49:42Z
Full Content:
Amazon coworkers: sign our open letter below to tell Amazon leadership that we need a more responsible rollout of AI. Every single signature makes our message stronger. In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond. We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth. We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm: Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants. Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas. Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement. Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional. Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance. All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need. We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following: No AI with dirty energy.No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments. No AI without employee voices.We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact. No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine. The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are. This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of. Signed, The Amazon employees below I signed the letter, what else can I do to help? Fill out our Get Involved form! We have a lot of work ahead to hold leadership accountable and we need all the help we can get. If you don’t work at Amazon, click here tosign on to a solidarity statement. I'm not an Amazon employee! What can I do? Your support can still help to strengthen our message to Amazon leadership. Click here to sign on anonymously to our solidarity statement. I’m signing with my name and personal contact info -- can Amazon see my name? Who’s going to have access to my information? Your contact info is confidential: we will not share it with Amazon or anyone else. We are asking for it so we can contact you with updates and to verify you work at Amazon. When at least 1,000 employees have signed the letter, we will publish the roles and orgs of all signatories, not names. We will not publish any employee names. I’m scared to sign. What are the risks? We will never share your name with Amazon or with anyone else. We will only publish job roles and orgs after we collect at least 1,000 signatures. We understand why you’re scared because we are too. We have written and signed this letter not only because we are deeply worried about senior leadership driving us into a dark future but also because we see an opportunity for our actions to ripple beyond just our company. We ourselves have been looking for inspiration, trying to find everyday people fighting to resist authoritarianism and all its insidious arms, and we realized that we can’t just rely on others to inspire or save us. We have to do our part too. Signing is a decision only you can make. Thank you for deeply considering. Why should I sign? Why does this matter? We wrote this letter because we feel a deep pit in our stomachs working at this company, knowing that our leadership is actively supporting the Trump administration and exploiting workers and the planet along the way. The AI transition, the climate crisis, and descent into authoritarianism are happening right now; Jassy and Bezos have already made it clear what they’re doing about it. We have a narrow window to demand a different path before it’s too late, and those demands will only be heard if as many of us as possible sign on and speak up together. There is too much at stake. Will this letter be released publicly? Will my name be shared publicly? After we hit at least 1,000 signatures from Amazon employees, we will publicly list all the roles and orgs of everyone who signed. We will NOT publish names. This letter will be fully public once it's released Amazon is a big company with a lot of power! What do we think this letter will do and why? We want to catalyze change, and we think amassing a number of signatures to a well-researched and well-publicized letter will do that in a few ways. It will add a much-needed dose of reality to the larger Al conversation. Right now, it seems like everyone is talking about AI, but the points in this letter are not being talked about enough. We can change that. The tide is already turning, and we’re at an inflection point; the MIT study about 95% of corporate purchases of AI failing to increase profits, and the possible deflation or even bursting of the AI bubble. It’s the right moment to start a more serious, balanced conversation. If enough employees sign and this letter enters public awareness, that may force Amazon leadership to respond in some way to our demands. We want tech workers to know that they have a voice and a stake in how AI development plays out, and that their perspectives are crucial in the fight for the future. We think the letter will encourage more conversations among tech workers at Amazon and beyond. Isn’t AI inevitable? What are some examples of workers being able to push back? SEIU in Pennsylvania established a workers council on AI. AAUP in Miami established an AI Task Force and sent out a survey asking faculty members and librarians how AI affects teaching and research—showing that AI is an issue that affects their working conditions. National Nurses United created a bill of rights regarding the use of AI in healthcare, including rights to person-to-person care and for developers to demonstrate that AI tools are safe before being used to help with patient care. And NNU has had some early victories — at USC hospitals and Kaiser Permanente — they’ve won assurances that AI won’t replace human nurses and for workers to form an oversight committee on how AI is getting used in hospitals. Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild, through sustained striking and contract negotiations, won new contracts that included some protections against GenAI being used without their consent or compensation, and more worker agency in determining how they use GenAI on the job.

November 06, 2025 04:05 ET | Source: DayTrading.com DayTrading.com LONDON, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analysis from an investor with 60,000+ hours trading under his belt and a degree in Economics from Harvard examines the current valuation landscape of U.S. equities. DayTrading.com’s Dan Buckley started by looking at basic metrics, namely the forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. This evaluates how much today’s investors are paying for each dollar of next year’s expected profit.The U.S. market is trading at roughly 23x forward earnings, which is far above the 15x times level seen in international markets. "This is an extreme gap, representing a roughly 51% void," Buckley says. "When valuations stretch this far, future returns are often modest at best and downright negative at worst." The last times the U.S. hit these sorts of valuations were: Buckley noted that since the 2021 peak, the U.S. stock market has delivered a compound annual return of around 9%, but before that, it went nearly a decade without making substantial, sustained gains. After the downturn in early 2022, U.S. equities took nearly two years just to get back to previous highs. A Market Bigger Than Its EconomyAnalysis from DayTrading.com reviewed several metrics highlighting a familiar pattern: global investors maintain a significant weighting in U.S. assets compared with the scale of the underlying economy. This imbalance reflects how influential U.S. markets have become within global portfolios and index benchmarks. U.S. Market ImbalanceThe research highlighted that the U.S. currently represents around 65% of the MSCI All Country World Index. This is a benchmark that guides billions in global investment flows. Yet by comparison, America produces only around 26% of the world’s economic output in nominal dollar terms, and it’s actually more like 15% when adjusted for the cost of living. Buckley noted that even investment vehicles labelled as "global" reflect this outsized concentration. For example, Vanguard’s Total World Stock ETF (VT), is often used as a diversified core holding by many institutions. That still invests around 66% of its assets in the U.S., with 4% just in Nvidia. "When one single chipmaker accounts for more in a portfolio than many entire countries, diversification is merely a slogan - not a reality," Buckley added. The Outsized Impact Of AIDayTrading.com's research took aim at AI, pointing out that roughly half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2025 stem from companies tied to artificial intelligence - semiconductor leaders, mega-cap platforms, and infrastructure providers. These include now household names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Palantir (PLTR). Buckley observed that AI has become a major focus for both markets and corporate strategy, but noted that the extent and pace of its long-term impact remain to be seen. "It’s true that AI will transform many businesses and their operations," he says. "But investors are pouring money in assuming every firm will be a winner, and better yet, all at the same time. But that’s rarely how innovation pays out – just look at the dot-com era, where many went under and only a few flourished." Market Perspective: A Measured ViewBuckley emphasized that his comments should not be interpreted as forecasting a market downturn. Rather, he offered a measured assessment of current U.S. equity conditions, noting potential areas of imbalance that may emerge when market expectations are elevated. While financial markets can often behave unpredictably, Buckley observed that not all sectors appear overextended. Certain segments—including financials, healthcare, select industrials, and international markets—continue to show valuations that align more closely with underlying fundamentals. “U.S. stocks don’t necessarily need a flood of negative news to experience adjustment,” Buckley noted. “Even subtle signs of strain can have an effect when perfection is already reflected in prices.”The full analysis is available here: U.S. Stocks: Great Expectations, Even Greater Valuations About DayTrading.comDayTrading.com is a platform that provides information and market analysis for individual investors.

Title: Asian shares advance after solid earnings and economic reports updates lift Wall Street

Wall Street logged tiny gains before the bell with markets relying heavily on corporate earnings data for insight into how the U.S. economy is doing in the absence of government data due to the shutdown Wall Street logged tiny gains before the bell Thursday with markets relying heavily on corporate earnings data for insight into how the U.S. economy is doing in the absence of government data due to the shutdown. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.2% ahead of the market's open, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1%. Shares of Lyft rose 6.2% after hours, even as the ride-hailing app badly missed Wall Street's sales and profit targets. However, Lyft did post some of its best-ever numbers across several categories and investors seemed optimistic about the company's multiple corporate partnerships, many related to autonomous vehicles. Food delivery app DoorDash tumbled 12% overnight after it warned investors that it will be spending significantly more on product development next year. DoorDash's third-quarter revenue beat Wall Street targets but its profit fell short. That, combined with research and development costs rising 23% to $355 million, sent investors for the exits. Elsewhere, in Europe at midday Britain's FTSE 100 ticked down a modest 0.1% after the Bank of England kept its main interest rate unchanged at 4% as expected. Germany's DAX lost 0.3% while the CAC 40 in Paris declined 0.6%. In Asia, shares bounced back from a retreat the day before. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.3% to 50,883.68. Shares in Nissan Motor Co. fell 1.7% after the company said it was selling its headquarters building in Yokohama to raise cash. After trading closed, Nissan reported a 221.9 billion yen ($1.4 billion) loss for April-September and said its revenue dropped 7% from a year earlier. In South Korea, the Kospi advanced 0.6% to 4,026.45. Taiwan's Taiex was up 0.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.1% to 26,485.90, while the Shanghai Composite index climbed 0.1% to 4,007.76. However, shares in autonomous driving companies Pony.ai and WeRide fell in their debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Pony.ai lost 9.3%, while WeRide's shares fell 10%. Shares in Cathay Pacific Airways gained 4% after it announced that Qatar Airways was selling its 9.57% stake in the Hong Kong-based carrier in a buyback worth $896 million. The deal is subject to shareholder approval. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review, including the monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which tends to stunt economic growth. In energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude gained 50 cents to $60.10 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, advanced 44 cents to $63.96 per barrel. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: What the $400 million Snap-Perplexity deal means for users

Every time Aditi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Snapchat users will soon be able to use the app as an AI search tool. On Wednesday, the social media platform announced a deal to integrate Perplexity AI into Snap's search engine. Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million in cash and equity over a year. "Perplexity's AI-powered answer engine will let Snapchatters ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat," Snap said in the Wednesday press release. The companies plan to roll out the Perplexity search engine in early 2026, per the release. A Perplexity spokesperson told Business Insider that user data from Snapchat would not be used for training its AI. "Our goal is to make AI more personal, social, and fun — woven into the fabric of your friendships, Snaps, and conversations," Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in the release. On Wednesday, Snap reported third-quarter revenue of $1.51 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. Its monthly active users increased 7% year-over-year to 943 million. Snap's stock price surged more than 17% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Shares are down more than 35% this year. The Perplexity-Snapchat tieup follows the lead of other social media platforms, such as Meta and X, that have integrated AI chatbots into their app interfaces. In April 2024, Meta introduced the Meta AI chatbot on its applications, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The chatbot received mixed reviews from users, some of whom complained about it being activated unnecessarily and hindering the app experience. In December, Elon Musk's X launched the Grok chatbot on its app for all free users, which he called a "politically incorrect" alternative to other chatbots. The Perplexity deal comes as Snap is seeing a change in how its users interact. Spiegel said on Wednesday's earnings call that there has been an "engagement shift from things like friend stories to content posted on Spotlight." Spotlight is Snapchat's public discover page, where users can view short, entertaining videos, similar to TikTok's "For You Page," or Instagram's Reels. The company plans to introduce features like games and conversation starters to reignite connections between users. Jump to

Title: WeRide’s CEO pitches robotaxis as a solution to aging populations and long commutes, as the firm raises more money for R&D with a HK IPO

Time Published: 2025-11-06T05:01:00Z

Nicholas Gordon is an Asia editor based in Hong Kong, where he helps to drive Fortune’s coverage of Asian business and economics news. Shares of WeRide start trading on Hong Kong’s stock exchange today, just over a year after the robotaxi firm forayed into U.S. markets with a Nasdaq listing. For founder and CEO Tony Han, the offering is part of a global strategy to fund the expensive but necessary research behind the company’s autonomous-driving tech. WeRide’s shares are now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. WeRide elected for a dual primary listing, which will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy the stock through the city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme. “We want to make our stock more accessible to investors all over the world,” Han told Fortune in late October, on the sidelines of the Fortune Global Forum. “China is a very important market, both for consumers and also for investors. A Hong Kong dual listing actually helps some potential investors who can only invest in the Hong Kong stock market to buy our stock.” Han says the funds raised through the Hong Kong listing will help the robotaxi firm continue to spend on R&D and deployment. “We will still need to raise more funds,” he said, “so this will put WeRide in a much better position to access more funds.” Fellow robotaxi firm Pony AI also starts trading in Hong Kong today after its own IPO on that exchange. Like WeRide, Pony AI listed on the Nasdaq late last year. Hong Kong’s IPO market is booming as Chinese firms hope to leverage the city’s access to both international and mainland Chinese capital. Firms listed in mainland China, including home appliance manufacturer Midea and battery-maker CATL, have launched secondary listings in Hong Kong in order to draw international investment. Yet several U.S.-listed Chinese companies are also considering primary listings in Hong Kong in order to access mainland Chinese investors. There’s also a geopolitical dimension: U.S.-listed Chinese firms may see Hong Kong as a backup in the event the Trump administration decides to delist them from U.S. exchanges, as part of a yearslong dispute between Washington and Beijing over auditing standards. The city’s Southbound Stock Connect scheme allows certified investors in mainland China to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong. Southbound flows hit a record $110 billion in the first seven months of the year, according to the South China Morning Post citing data from Wind, already greater than the entire total in 2024. Investors are flocking to AI firms and “new consumption”—think Pop Mart and Labubu. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up around 32% for the year so far; by comparison, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is up 22%. WeRide raised $308 million in its Hong Kong IPO, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Shares were priced at 27.10 Hong Kong dollars, a slight discount to the stock’s Nasdaq price at Monday’s close. WeRide HK-listed shares fell almost 12% on their first day of Hong Kong trading; the firm’s shares have lost over 40% of their value since the U.S. IPO. Pony AI’s HK shares fell around 14%. Tony Han, formerly chief scientist at Baidu’s autonomous vehicle unit, founded WeRide in 2017. Based in Guangzhou, the self-driving vehicle company operates in several major Chinese cities, as well as markets outside China. The company has deployments in Singapore, France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. WeRide is now testing or operating vehicles in 30 cities across 11 countries. WeRide is a member of this year’s Future 50, Fortune’s annual ranking of companies with the greatest potential for growth. The firm is also a member of this year’s Change the World list, which highlights companies that are doing social good through their business models. Han evangelizes the many ways that self-driving vehicles—and moving away from a car-centric culture—can improve society. He predicts that accident rates will be “drastically reduced” once cars are put in the hands of computers as opposed to humans. “Most accidents, we find, are due to human factors,” Han explained, citing the effects of drinking, drowsiness, and distraction on human drivers. “Machines won’t be drunk, won’t overdose. Machines are very reliable. Fatal accident rates for robotaxis are much lower than human drivers.” Less congestion could be another benefit of automated vehicles. “Robotaxis will never speed, will never just cut in line,” he said. “Traffic will just flow much more smoothly.” There’s a broader economic argument for self-driving cars in countries whose populations are rapidly aging as birth rates decline—a particularly thorny problem in China and elsewhere in Asia. “With such huge markets, we will need lots of labor in transport and mobility,” Han said. “If we are shorthanded, then we have to use AI to replace the shortage, to fill the gap between demand and requirements.” That extends to public transport and public services. WeRide runs robobuses, robosweepers, and other automated forms of public transit and city vehicles. “The cost of bus drivers in a developed economy is quite high,” Han explained. If these costs can be reduced through automation, he argued, then cities can expand their transit systems and “help build more eco-friendly transportation for the whole planet.” WeRide reported $27.9 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, a 32% jump from the same period a year earlier. Still, the company reported a $110 million net loss for that same period, owing in large part to spending of $90 million on research and development, approaching the $107 million spent on R&D for all of 2024. Robotaxis remain an expensive and unprofitable proposition. An HSBC report in July pointed out that self-driving cars have a lot of hidden costs, including remote supervisors, charging and parking infrastructure, and tech support. The bank suggested that robotaxis might not break even until about eight years after launch. Yet HSBC also predicted that robotaxis will likely reach their commercial potential in China first, owing to greater adoption and acceptance of robotaxi technologies. Chinese companies are leading the global push for robotaxis. In addition to WeRide and Pony AI, Baidu is also expanding its robotaxi offerings through its Apollo Go vehicles. China also manufactures many of the components that go into self-driving cars. One key component producer is Hesai Technology, the world’s leading producer of automotive lidar sensors, which are used by robotaxis and other autonomous vehicles to recognize their environment and avoid obstacles. Global ride-share companies are taking notice. WeRide is offering its Middle Eastern robotaxis through a partnership with Uber. Singaporean ride-hailing firm Grab has also made a strategic equity investment in WeRide, and is working with the Chinese firm to offer its Robotaxi GXRs and robobuses in Singapore starting next year. Singaporean transit company ComfortDelGro, meanwhile, is working with Pony AI to explore offering robotaxis, while Lyft is collaborating with Baidu to test its Apollo Go self-driving cars in Europe. By comparison, U.S.-based robotaxi operations are proving to be a lot slower in global expansion. Waymo currently operates in Tokyo and London. Han isn’t surprised that global firms are now embracing Chinese robotaxis. After all, if China offers the best product, why wouldn’t foreign firms want to cooperate with it? “When I was a teenager, we bought electronics from Japan, tools from Germany, and computers from the U.S. It’s very normal. It’s very normal,” Han said. “If WeRide can supply good robotaxi technology and services to Uber, and in turn, Uber and WeRide together bring a very efficient and comfortable taxi service to ordinary people; why shouldn’t we do that?” Clarification, Nov. 6, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify that WeRide will offer both robotaxi and robobus services in Singapore, as well as to note the total number of markets the firm operates in.

November 05, 2025 20:30 ET | Source: WeRide Inc. WeRide Inc. HONG KONG, Nov. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WeRide (HKEX: 0800.HK, NASDAQ: WRD), a global leader in autonomous driving technology, today announced its successful listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (HKEX) under the stock code 0800.HK, becoming the world's first Robotaxi company to be publicly traded on both Hong Kong and US exchanges. With that, WeRide also becomes the world's first Robotaxi and autonomous driving technology company to achieve a dual primary listing on both HKEX and NASDAQ. Under its Hong Kong listing, WeRide issued a total of 88.25 million shares (pre-greenshoe), with 17.65 million shares offered publicly and 70.60 million shares for international placement. The offer price was set at HKD 27.1 per share, raising a total of approximately HKD 2.39 billion (pre-greenshoe). Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, had voluntarily committed to a three-year lock-up on October 28, 2025, pledging not to sell any of his shares for the next three years. This demonstrated the founder's and management team's confidence in WeRide's fundamentals and growth, as well as their full commitment to the company's long-term vision and global expansion. "We are deeply grateful to our partners, investors, customers, and every member of the WeRide team. Your trust and dedication have helped turn our vision of autonomous driving into reality. Over the past eight years, WeRide has evolved from technological innovation to commercial operation, becoming the only company worldwide with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries, and deployments in over 30 cities across 11 countries. We firmly believe that safe and reliable autonomous driving technology will deliver huge economic and social benefits. Our Hong Kong listing marks a new beginning, and we will continue to lead with technology, drive global commercial deployment, and deliver long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and society," said Dr. Tony Han, Founder and CEO of WeRide, at the listing ceremony. Founded in 2017, WeRide was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange on October 25, 2024, becoming the world's first publicly listed Robotaxi and universal autonomous driving technology company. The HKEX listing broadens its investor base and access to capital markets, enabling deeper investment in technology R&D and accelerating the global deployment of its autonomous vehicle fleet. Powered by its proprietary WeRide One universal autonomous driving technology platform, WeRide offers Level 2 to Level 4 (L4) products and services across smart mobility, smart logistics, and smart sanitation, including the Robotaxi, Robobus, Robosweeper, Robovan and ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). With WeRide GENESIS, its self-developed, closed-loop simulation engine, WeRide has also significantly lowered road testing costs and safety risks, accelerating product iteration efficiency, market expansion speed, and commercial deployment scale. Currently, WeRide is the only technology company in the world with products holding autonomous driving permits in seven countries – China, the UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, France, Belgium, and the US. The company operates a fleet of more than 1,500 L4 vehicles, including over 700 Robotaxis. Partnering with Uber in Abu Dhabi, WeRide operates the largest commercial Robotaxi fleet outside of China and the US. Looking ahead, WeRide plans to deploy tens of thousands of Robotaxis by 2030. On industry collaboration, WeRide continues to attract leading global investors and ecosystem partners, building a strategic network with companies such as NVIDIA, Bosch, Uber, Grab, and Renault-Nissan. It is also the only autonomous driving company to receive investment commitments from ride-hailing giants Uber and Grab, highlighting its strategic position and leading role in the industry. WeRide has achieved multiple key milestones in the global commercial deployment of L4 autonomous vehicles. In China, fully driverless WeRide Robotaxis are now commercially operating in Guangzhou and Beijing, with 24-hour autonomous services extended to major transport hubs such as airports and train stations. In core markets such as the Middle East and Singapore, WeRide maintains a first-mover advantage of at least 1.5 years over its competitors. In European countries such as France, Switzerland, and Belgium, WeRide is the only autonomous driving company to have commercially deployed an L4 vehicle fleet. In the ADAS sector, WeRide and Bosch’s jointly developed one-stage end-to-end assisted driving solution has successfully reached SOP and is set to enter mass production in 2025. These developments demonstrate the global adaptability and competitiveness of WeRide’s technology and business model across various regions. With strong technology competence and a global commercial footprint, WeRide has been recognized internationally, including twice on Fortune's Change the World list – the only autonomous driving company to date – and twice on Fortune's Global Future 50, ranking 16th this year, the highest among Chinese companies. Following its dual primary listing on HKEX and NASDAQ, WeRide remains committed to its mission of transforming urban living with autonomous driving. The company will continue to advance autonomous driving technology, expand global commercial operations, and work with partners worldwide to build a safer, more efficient, comfortable, and sustainable smart mobility ecosystem.

Pinterest stock plunged 20% after reporting weak Q3 2025 earnings and issuing a disappointing holiday outlook. The social media giant’s adjusted EPS missed estimates, while North American ad revenue slowed sharply, erasing its 2025 gains. Despite hitting a record 498 million monthly users, investor focus shifted to declining monetization and margins. Adding pressure, Meta’s $70–72 billion AI spending plan spooked markets over profitability risks. Pinterest closed below $31, its lowest level this year, as ad slowdown fears hit social media stocks broadly.

(iQPS). The mission was Rocket Lab’s sixth dedicated mission for iQPS, making Rocket Lab the most prolific launcher of their Earth-imaging constellation to date. ‘The Nation God Navigates’ mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 19:51 UTC on November 5th to deploy a single synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging satellite named QPS-SAR-14 (nicknamed YACHIHOKO-I for the Japanese god of nation-building) to a 575km circular Earth orbit. Electron will launch six more dedicated iQPS missions following the recent signing of an additional multi-launch agreement to build out their constellation in low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: "Success in the space industry boils down to precision and repeatability. This latest mission for iQPS once again demonstrates the pinpoint accuracy our customers depend on to grow their constellations, and we’re grateful to the iQPS team for trusting us with their launch needs. With six seamless deployments for iQPS in the books, Electron is ready for the next six.” iQPS CEO, Dr. Shunsuke Onishi, says: “We are pleased to announce the successful deployment of QPS-SAR-14 ‘YACHIHOKO-I’, marking our fifth successful launch this year. This milestone reflects the steady advancement of our technology and the growth of our team. We sincerely thank the Electron team and all our members for their outstanding work. With this success, we move closer to realizing our vision of near real-time Earth observation and delivering greater value to society.” ‘The Nation God Navigates’ was Electron’s 74th launch to date and 16th this year, meeting Rocket Lab’s current record high of yearly launches, which was 16 in 2024. With more Electron missions scheduled throughout the remainder of 2025, Rocket Lab is on track for another record-breaking year of launches, all while the Company prepares for the debut launch of its medium-lift reusable rocket, Neutron.

The gains were broad and marked a reversal from the prior day's dip. Nearly every sector within the S&P 500 gained ground and the index recovered a majority of its losses from Tuesday, the AP reports. Company earnings and forecasts were once again a big focus for Wall Street, with results coming from a broad spectrum of industries. McDonald's rose 2.2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.1% after beating Wall Street's latest quarterly profit forecasts. On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 9.4% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting.

The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review. A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the US economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting. "The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown," Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors.

Coming into this interview I wasn’t even sure what “AI Transformation” was, let alone why so many companies pay for it. Here’s the deal: Tenex, the company founded by Alex Lieberman & Arman Hezarkhani, goes into companies hunting for ways to save or making them money using AI. Once they find that, it becomes a no brainer for companies to hire them to build it. But Tenex does more than AI Transformation. They also run a dev shop where their developers use AI to build super fast for clients. The podcast is in all major apps, just search for Mixergy.You can also use our RSS feed. Alex Lieberman and Arman Hezarkhani are the co-founders of Tenex, a company blending high-performance engineering with AI transformation consulting. Their model aligns incentives around output rather than time, helping enterprises and startups build software faster and integrate AI across people, processes, and tools. Together, they’re building what they call the “McKinsey for AI”—a hybrid of dev shop, consultancy, and innovation lab helping companies thrive in the post-AI era. Andrew Warner: Hey there, freedom Fighters. My name is Andrew Warner and this is a new series for me. It’s called The Next New Thing. Here’s what’s up in this interview, then an intro. Then we’ll get right to it. What is AI transformation? Alex: We don’t think most companies are going to Arman: cross the chasm from pre AI to post ai, and we believe we can be the household name to do that. Andrew Warner: Gimme an example of a project that you took on and what you were able to do that wasn’t possible. Before Arman: STEP exports, they were looking for a dev shop to build them a mobile app. Traditionally, you would need a full design team, product managers, engineers, and a ton of money using AI tools. When we hear, oh, I have a request for a feature, we go over there and we prototype it and we hand it over to the client. We say, is this how you want it to behave? Now we can go and we can build production grade code incredibly quickly. Andrew Warner: At some point you’ve run outta ways to save people money. This doesn’t seem like a sustainable business. Arman: Does a BizOps person ever run out of work to do in a company or does McKinsey ever run out of work to do with business? I’m a Andrew Warner: little skeptical. Alex Lieberman and Armand has ar Connie run 10 x, which does outsource dev work and helps companies use ai. Intro: The next new thing, Andrew Warner: so I got the two co-founders of 10 X here in front of me, and the thing that I wanna understand is what is AI transformation? Because I see so many agencies building up this AI transformation practice. And you both have been doing phenomenally with it. In fact, you actually are doing it as part of your business. Arman: So most of the revenue comes from engineering, but our fastest growing part of the business is AI transformation. It, it’s very easy to implement AI as a person. In your lead, you can basically tell somebody, Hey, Andrew, instead of using Google, start using this thing called chat, GBT. You use it once and then you’re like, holy crap, this is really great. And then you just very simply shift your behavior. It’s literally one step. But to do that on a business, we call that like multiplayer ai. That’s really, really tough. That takes studying, that takes change management, that takes tool building, that takes training. It takes the change of people, process and technology and McKinsey words. Um, and that’s where we come in. Alex: And one thing that you may find interesting is why we’re doing like engineering as a service as like a big part of our business, um, versus just AI transformation. Armand and I met. Five years ago, I had invested in his first business and we were catching up eight months ago at this point. And he basically had shared with me that he had to pivot his previous company and when he pivoted it, he had to lay off most of his engineering team and he just had himself and he had one product designer who studied Compsci in college but hadn’t had hands on keyboard in a long time. And yet their output of production ready software, five Xed. And when I asked why or how, he basically said how he didn’t have a choice but to basically re scaffold the entire product and engineering process from how PRDs are written to how code is structured. Everything was redone and. When I heard him say this, that for me, even though I’ve experienced like two or three acts, whatever the improvement is of cha bt, that was truly orders of magnitude more leverage that I had seen. And one of the things I’ve realized working around engineers now is engineers are living in the future. Like they are seeing the greatest leverage of AI relative to all areas of knowledge work. And so as we were building 10 x, you know, we had that in mind, which is like you can have this incredible leverage, uh, that engineers are experiencing. At the same time you have AI consultancies or like, you know, the mbbs of the world that are doing these gen AI projects. And there’s all these stats either about gen AI projects just like not working, right? There’s like the, the MIT study that came out around 95% of them don’t work. But also a lot of this work is project based. It’s one time revenue. And for us what was exciting was. How do we actually control the AI internally where we have engineers who are leveraging it to be far more productive than engineers at other companies? How do we use that to sign 12 month contracts? Right? That is highly retentive, highly recurring, and we use that as the Trojan Horse to do transformation work after having that line of business. Jesse Pujji: What’s a typical scope Arman: from the engineering perspective? It’s basically like, one of the core beliefs is that the demand for software engineering is infinite. Uh, it’s, it’s completely as price will go down, the, the, the demand will increase. And so the scope is pretty vast right now. Like we’re building one of our clients, we built them a mobile app that hit 20th in the app store for another one of our clients. We built a, um, an AI agent that helps the front desk at offices around the United States at, at, um. Healthcare offices, like doctor’s offices around the us Jesse Pujji: But is it fair to say right now, I guess it’s, it’s like a, there’s a lot of companies out there that will do engineering. Hey, you need an app built, you need a website, you know, whatever. We’ll do that for you. But you guys have now, are now using probably cursor plus your own agents that handle a lot of, you know, pieces of building those building blocks together. And I know Alex loves Legos. So you’ve got your own Legos that are proprietary to you guys. Legos that allow you to then produce bigger, faster, smarter, that same scope, Alex: the engineering as a service side of the business. Just think of it as like a high quality AI powered dev shop. Jesse Pujji: Mm-hmm. Alex: And I actually love the idea of that line of business because dev shops have such an unsexy perception. Mm-hmm. We don’t charge hourly. Like we have a fundamental belief that service businesses are gonna move away from hourly work. Yeah. And we think it’s starting with engineering. So our clients pay us based on output and our engineers are paid on output as well. And the reason that is so valuable. We can hire truly the best engineers I’ve ever worked with because, just as an example, like our best engineer will make a million bucks in cash next year. Jesse Pujji: Yep. Alex: And and and it’s not like stock in a startup, it’s cash, Jesse Pujji: cash money. Yeah, Alex: exactly. And Jesse Pujji: so, like Alex, you and I talked a lot about the Red Ventures business. They’re all about alignment. And Andrew came with me to see Rick, uh, the other day about a year ago. And one of his favorite quotes is, show me how someone gets paid and I’ll show you how they behave. And this feels like a really cool way to align the value based pricing orientation across, across the board. Alex: Exactly. And what that allows us to do that, as you were alluding to, like the big vision is it not only allows us to do great work on the service side of the business, whether that’s engineering or transformation work, but as we think about building IP internally, we truly have the best technical talent in the world to do it because like we, we are now as competitive in terms of pay and environment as a big tech company. Jesse Pujji: Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. Alright. What’s the big vision? Arman: Was looking, or we were looking at the, the big hyperscalers and seeing that they’re spending billions and billions and billions of dollars building data centers to build something that is being commoditized, um, where most of the values accruing to the application layer. And so if you look at OpenAI, if you look at anthropic, so many of their releases now that are getting eyeballs are apps that they released and application layer tools that they release. Jesse Pujji: Hmm. Arman: For the first time, like we were all really excited about GPT-3 0.5. And so when they released 4, 4 0 4 0.5, we were all, that was like an Apple release. Right? Right. But when five was released, no one like this was like a, an after crickets. Yeah. Alex: Absolute crickets. Arman: But what that does is it opens up an opportunity in the application layer where for zero cost, you can compete with these hyperscalers. All you need is brilliant people in a ring. Jesse Pujji: Hmm. Arman: And so. In, when I was in like 10th grade, I read this book by Walter Isaacson called The Innovators. Basically the story of like the people who like invented the first computer and the first programming language all the way to like modern internet ai, mobile devices. Basically, it, it, it, it becomes this, this study of how innovation happens, and it’s a very simple equation. You put very smart people in a room. You give them freedom, but you also put freedom in the form of like financial freedom or somehow mm-hmm. You give them fuel, but then you also give them a direction and you give them some form of commercial pressure, right? In the form of, um, whether that is investment, you have to get a return or I’m, I’m, I’m, uh, bell Telephone Company and, and Bell Labs is a research institution, but they have to output something for the company. Similarly, we think that if we can build a team of geniuses and we can give them freedom and direction, then we can compete with these hyperscalers. The question is how do you do that? How do you build a team of geniuses? This is how, um, we’re doing it starting with the world’s best dev shop, then the world’s best consultancy. And as we’re doing this, we’re building ip. And by the way, as we do that, we have a distribution advantage, not only from Alex, but also from the customers that we built trust with and we’re actually already working with. And we think that, that the tam for this business is basically the GDP of the entire world. Every single business need in the world sure needs it in those Alex: 1 1, 1 other way I would just frame it is what would it look like if McKinsey Bayner, BCG was created today? Jesse Pujji: Right? So, but is that, is that the end game? Do you wanna be, become the McKinsey of AI or the Accenture even? Alex: Our view is there’s this massive technology innovation that’s happening. We don’t think most companies are going to be resourced to cross the chasm from pre AI to post ai. And we believe we can be the household name to do that, either through services or through product. Andrew Warner: Here’s what I wanna understand. Let’s stick with the dev part for a bit and then we’ll come back to the AI transformation. Gimme an example of a project that you took on and what you were able to do and what your developers were able to do that wasn’t possible before. Okay. Arman: Yeah. So as an example, use step exports. Okay. They’re a social media company. Um, and the reason why I use them is because they were traditionally going with a, they were looking for a dev shop to build them a mobile app that is basically like their vision for it is like HQ trivia for sports fans. Okay. Traditionally, for a product like this, you would need a full design team, a full team of product managers, a team of engineers, um, and you would charge a ton of money and it would take, you would basically scope out the entire project and then six months later you’d come back with a product and then it would either work or wouldn’t. Um, the way that we work is. We hear, oh, I have a request for a feature. We go over there, we prototype it, and we hand it over to the client. We say, is this how we want it to behave? And then we have a brand book from them. And so we know what the UI generally should look like. We know what a button looks like, we know what an input looks like. And now that we know what the behavior looks like, because we’re able to, to iterate on it, um, in a vibe coding platform, now we can go and we can build production grade, uh, code incredibly quickly. The act of writing code is no longer the barrier. So no one on our team actually types letters into an id. If I walk through a WeWork and I see someone typing letters in IID they’re working in like 1990, right? Yeah. So we’re using, we’re pushing modern AI tools to the absolute limit so that we are scoping work down until the, the most atomic level, and then we’re getting it done and we’re architecting it such that we’re really treating these AI agents. What does Andrew Warner: it mean to scope, to scope down to the atomic level? Arman: So let’s say you wanna build Slack, right? Andrew Warner: Yep. Arman: It’s a gigantic platform. And typically what you would do is you would manage, you’d, you’d have a product manager who would break that down into, uh, sprints, and then they would break those down into tickets, right? Yep. And then at, at, to some extent, the engineer would have quite a bit of freedom around that ticket. The tickets are quite broad. We go, we drill, our engineers drill all the way down until they’re micro tasks. And this is really what, this is the difference between an AI engineer and a traditional software engineer. An AI engineer needs to think like an architect. They have to think as if they’re, uh, they’re delegating all of their work to other engineers. And when they’re delegating their work, how do they do that? Right? And not only are they delegating their work to engineers, they’re very special engineers. These AI agents, they’re incredibly high iq, but they make really stupid mistakes that as you work with them regularly, you can understand what they are. And when you work with these, you get really good at managing them and understanding them. Most of our engineers have multiple different terminals open each with a different coding agent, and they’re just, they’re trucking on all of them. So they’re really acting as managers Of these different agents, are Jesse Pujji: they, are they using voice or are they using, are they, are they typing? Arman: Frankly, I think that the voice thing’s overblown. I think that when you work in an office, it’s like unrealistic to talk out loud. I think that the voice thing is like useful if you’re an executive driving your Tesla to and from work and you wanna, and you wanna speak to, to an ai. Jesse Pujji: So you don’t think the whole world’s gonna start talking to their computers and, and voice pilled? Arman: I, I think they might, but like in our office, for example, it’s impractical and I don’t know how that works in, in a modern office setting. I Jesse Pujji: think I understand when you’re scoping this piece of work, you launch a mobile app for someone, you can be, I’m, I’m making this up, you can be cheaper to them than they would’ve paid otherwise because of all this stuff you guys have done and it’s probably higher margin business for you guys. Alex: Yeah. Uh, the way I basically think about it is it’s, it’s, um, Jesse Pujji: because you have like a 10% engineer, 11% engineering team, but it’s really only one human being and 10. Correct. 10 pieces of Alex: it’s, it’s basically if, if traditional dev orgs or dev shops are labor arbitrage, we’re intelligence arbitraging. Jesse Pujji: I mean, it’s interesting, the AI transformation aspect of that is that just sizzle really. And then the real thing is actually just go get media engineering projects and, and focus on those. Like for example, today, I would argue with you and Alex, this is, Alex is my friend, so we’re gonna keep this as informal as possible. Like I would tell you guys today, I obviously believe that AI transformation will be a hundreds of billions of dollars industry. But today Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Engineering development is actually a multi-hundred billion and AI transformation is like a $10 billion industry. Alex: Yeah. Well, I mean, uh, candidly this is something we talk about all of the time, uh, is what should that balance look like? Because the engineering as a service business one, there are, there’s really no one else doing it in the way we’re doing it right now. And also it is such good revenue, like it is just so retentive, it’s latched onto the core technology of a company. Totally. Whereas to your point, like AI transformation oftentimes is project based. It’s harder to make recurring, Jesse Pujji: well, not to mention like problem versus solution, right? I mean, one thing you guys have to be careful of, there’s this, there’s this meme that was going around that was like, CEOs are like, we want ai. Yep. You must’ve shared it, Alex. Like, Alex: when, when do we want it? We want it now. Jesse Pujji: What, what do we want it for? We have no idea. Like, yeah. And that’s, there’s actually a lot of risk and wasted time and energy in terms of firm building. If you guys are building a firm off of this fickle revenue where nobody actually has a problem, they’re just looking for a solution and as opposed to finding problems, that’s a much, much more interesting place to be playing in and solving the problem better and cheaper and faster than anybody else can solve it. ’cause here’s, here’s another, I’ll throw crazy idea as you, uh, you, Alex, with your platform when Red Ventures bought bank rate. If it was a publicly traded company, they paid $1.3 billion for it. They paid 10 times ebitda, roughly, according to their math. Rick knew he had done the math, he had seen all the levers. He knew that within a year of closing it, I mean, his projections were that his effective EBITDA would’ve been five times EBITDA because he knew exactly how he was gonna double the EBITDA of the business. And he came in three months ahead of time. He got it done in nine months, right? Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: You guys, if, if what you’re saying is real and you get really good at it, you could go buy these dev shops and, and essentially you could increase, they already have books of business, by the way, which is, which is makes your life so much easier than Alex tweeting all the time. And you go buy a $10 million revenue business with all the clients and everything already, and you guys can effectively rip out 70% of their costs, it sounds like, and deliver a better product. And now that’s like the math there is actually more compelling. ’cause you could probably buy ’em at six times EBITDA effectively, but then you’re actually buying ’em at three. Like anytime you have a real capability, that thesis is like very, very powerful. Alex: Yeah. Yeah. You’re basically just, you’re buying distribution and you know, you can basically arb the product, like the, the customer experience, Jesse Pujji: not, not to mention, dude, you can finance the whole thing with debt. Like, if you buy something at six times, you can borrow half that cost. But if you’re effectively, because you know, you can double their ebitda, you effectively have no equity out. I mean, that’s how, like, there’s a company in St. Louis, I found the other day that I got all excited about, you’ve never heard of it? It’s called Proficient. Alex: No, Jesse Pujji: it just sold for $3 billion. I mean, it’s, it’s been around 20 years, but it’s literally like a rollup of one of these, like Salesforce, Microsoft Alex: implementation Jesse Pujji: companies, implementation companies. And it just, every year it would like pick a different part of the, the, you know, the, I think I call it the function vertical box, like HR for pharma, marketing for, and it just, but did a bunch of deals and like exited for $3 billion. Um, Arman: so Jesse, let me ask you this. We love all our children equally, whether you’re an engineering client or a transformation client, you’re, you’re a 10 x client, you’re part of the club, and let’s say we can drive some amount of efficiency for our clients, right? You’re talking about driving efficiency for a dev shop, but what if we can prove that we’re driving efficiency for our clients? Right. How do you think about deploying that company to AI transformation or like general efficiency, like a traditional PE clay or focusing on dev shop and going that direction? Jesse Pujji: Yeah, I, I mean, I would, I, I would chase the problems. I guess. Like, it, it kind of like, I mean, if you would’ve solved the same problem, let’s, it’s, you know, and this is what our RCTO tells me all the time, Adam. He’s like, look, you just think about the, how do you, how does anyone decide how to spend money on dev? They do impact, cost, and ease, right? Through the same analysis. How big could this be money-wise, saving us? How confident are we gonna work and how costly or expensive is it? And we, you know, at am push, we used to do that all the time and like, it was like, damn, should we build our own? The API pulls from data’s Facebook layer, or should we use a third party or, you know, should we not do it at all? And then everyone does the stack ranking and they go, well, we only have $2 million of engineering resources, or $3 million of engineering resources. So we should basically say no to everything below this hurdle. But now you guys know this, like AI allows us to go faster and way cheaper, but it’s like if everything gets cheaper and faster, then the amount of things people are gonna do is gonna go up dramatically. Andrew Warner: Yep. Jesse Pujji: So I guess my answer to that is like, what are the real problems they have that like the, those, those, and, and maybe some of your projects still are 90% non-AI, but you’re using all your AI tools to do it. ’cause as you guys wa I mean watch anyone coding with Cursor or any of these other tools and it’s fucking insane. Like Yeah, I, my my point is like the actual AI ness of it is not actually that important. If I’m you guys based on Arman: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: What, what Alex said about the, ’cause I’m, by the way, I’m a services business guy. Like annual contracts, aligned compensation models, margins improving like. Services business are hard to build for a reason because most people don’t have some of those things. And even like, I mean I always talk about this like publicly aush growth assistant very soon, like within months is gonna pass ambush as ebitda. Do you know why? Alex: The cost of labor? Jesse Pujji: Nope. Retention. Arman: Mm-hmm. Jesse Pujji: Aush would get big and then two of our biggest clients would churn because they’re, oh, we’re gonna take this in-house. People don’t take global talent in-house for the most part. Like some of our bigger clients have said, Hey, we have some, but like that isn’t, you’re making a thousand bucks a month off. I mean like we just, the retention in am in AM and growth systems is amazing. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Right. And so that’s, I would just like tell you guys, McKinsey, by the way, and some of these guys have massive retention. Alex: Are you saying basically just because of the partner’s relationship, they’re constantly selling in new work Jesse Pujji: constantly. And that doesn’t even, by the way, at their prices, just, and, and this is something we see with OX too. We see a lot of like, oh, it’s not, it’s not like SaaS retention, but it is like they keep coming back to us for more and more projects, of course. And we feel good that we can actually manage and project that. So, Alex: and, and to your question about is it sizzle? I think irrespective of what direction we choose, like what is the balance of engineering or transformation work, I do think positioning in a AI transformation way gets us more engineering clients than if we did not position in that way. Jesse Pujji: Yeah, fair enough. Alex: Half of our clients have come through these free AI diagnostics We do. And so we run these diagnostics. They take two weeks. Most of it’s been automated. The only thing that’s not automated is basically three hours of stakeholder interviews, but half of those have turned into our engineering clients. That’s smart. And so, yeah. Andrew Warner: So wait, let’s, let’s talk about the transformation part of the business. Gimme an example of what you’ve done for someone. What did they walk in with? How did you understand what they needed and then what did they buy? Arman: The first part, the understanding what they needed is, is actually the core. And the way we do that is, um, Alex is talking about what we call our diagnostic, and that’s the free version. And then we also have an audit, which is the, the paid version. It’s basically anywhere from like 10 to 20 interviews, data requests, a survey, a lot of deep research that we do on our own, like, um, and, but the output of either of these, obviously the diagnostic is lighter than the audit is a report. The report has our learnings. It’s aligned with the goals of the business. Whatever Andrew Warner: pick, pick one. Pick a specific customer. You don’t have to tell me their name. What did you do? What, uh, what did you, what did you talk to them about? What did you uncover and what, what did you do afterwards, after this transformation? Arman: So, basically, one of them is a, is a SaaS company that works in healthcare. We did an audit for them. Um, and there are two types of interviews that we do in the audit. Or actually, lemme start with the survey. So the survey, basically the way that we think about it is. It goes to everybody in the company, or if, if the audit is specifically part of the, of the go to market org, Andrew Warner: whatever. But again, gimme, gimme a specific company. I need to see the picture of what this is. So a billboard company finds you because of Alex’s tweets, I’m assuming? Yeah. Arman: Yeah. Okay. So Alex posts on LinkedIn. Uh, actually, uh, quick, quick, quick kind of note here. All of our businesses come through LinkedIn, not Twitter. So, wow. So, so basically there’s a, there’s a billboard company and there’s the, they do traditional billboard selling where like, you’ll, you’re a big business and you’ll call them up and you say, Hey, I want to be on a billboard. And they, they’ll put you there. But they also have like a, a platform that’s similar to Uber for billboards, where you can go on, you can upload a picture, you can say, I want it to go here. Click go. Okay, cool. They came to us saying, Hey, I want to use AI in the company. Uh, I want to work, I want AI to be in the engineering platform. I want AI to be in the product itself. We’re not sure where, but we know that there’s opportunities. Here are a few ideas, but we want you to greenfield. Go, go check it out. So we started with a survey. The goal of the survey sends to everyone in the company, and the goal is to understand, we basically think of that as building a map for us, right? It lays out the entirety of the company from an org chart perspective, but also it gives us an idea of where to look. Then, based on that, we set up interviews. So, so as an example, the survey really highlighted the product org. Okay? So we spoke to the product org. We had a couple of saw calls with sales. We had a couple of calls with other people just to kind of poke around different areas, but to really focus on product. Andrew Warner: Yeah, we Arman: spoke to the product manager, we spoke to engineers, we spoke to the CTO, all these different people on product. What we found is there were areas in of, of opportunity in their product, so we dug in deeper. We used the product, we checked it out in the flow. Similar to like if you’ve uploaded a a, a Facebook ad, you start with the Facebook ad, you set a goal. If you upload an image, you set a caption, whatever, and then you click go, I wanna run the Facebook ad. They have a similar flow for uploading a billboard. So you start with, I wanna run it on these billboards in this area. I have this goal and this budget. I wanna upload an image. And so on. We asked about drop off data, so where are people dropping off? And then we noticed that after this, we asked what happens after they click go? And there’s two levels of moderation that are done by humans. Okay. So even just in this flow, we notice that there’s drop off at either of those, uh, moderation levels. One of them is for like internal moderation, and then they send it to the billboard owner to moderate, and there’s drop off at each of those levels. Andrew Warner: And so you’re saying, look, we’re losing users. It’s human beings. Easy for us to use AI to replace humans. Give a response quickly. Got it. Arman: Exactly. Andrew Warner: Okay. Arman: Likewise, in the, in the, in the flow of uploading an image and, and uh, kind of building that campaign, we notice that people. People don’t know what a good ad is. Okay? And so they’re drop off of the creative step. And so we noticed that with the same algorithm that is helping do the moderation, we can also help give feedback on the creative that’s uploaded to the platform and even built in the platform using ai. Got it. So basically we made these recommendations. We said, Hey, we’re gonna build you an algorithm that’s going to be used in the creative step to give feedback. We’re also gonna use this to replace moderation. We’re also going to help you build AI powered, um, like an AI powered billboard generator and so on. We built a, we, we made a few of these recommendations, and for each one, there’s basically a lift versus reward. So how much is this gonna cost and how much are you gonna get out of this and that? What are you gonna get outta this is tied directly to the business’s goals, whether it be revenue, even, whatever. Andrew Warner: This doesn’t seem like a sustainable business. At some point you’ve run outta ways to save people money. So does that mean that all these AI transformation companies eventually have to turn into engineering businesses where they could get ongoing work? Or is there something that I’m missing in ongoing work in AI transformation? Arman: Does a BizOps person ever run out of work to do in a company or does McKinsey ever run out of work to do with a, with a business? I think that like there there are examples, an Andrew Warner: efficiency expert. Does they run outta work? Jesse Pujji: Sort of. I think there’s enough. I mean, uh, Andrew, I think, I think there’s a couple issues. You know, one is AI is changing at a rapid, rapid pace, right? Yeah. And when I built AM push every six months, Facebook would change the way it worked. And it was just to our benefit. Because every time AI changes, some new model’s gonna launch. And then the same people who you did work for a year ago are gonna like, oh shit, we need to do more work here. Right? So that’s one thing. But then the other thing is I think the point of. Consultancies exist and they ebb and flow. It’s not to, not to say there’s not cyclical market issues they have to deal with, but, but there’s always work for companies where they have problems and they have issues. Um, and, and you know, it’s pretty perpetual. Andrew Warner: I’m a little skeptical. I’ll be open with you because partially what I heard you all say, uh, both Armand and Alex say earlier is the reason the debt business is so exciting is there is ongoing work. Yeah. You get embedded, you keep building with them. So maybe, maybe there is some place where AI transformation just kind of, if not dies, it goes down dramatically and you have to keep getting new business. Alex: One question I would have for you is, so I think what you’re saying makes sense. Do you have an overall skepticism of management consulting firms? Andrew Warner: Interesting. I like the way you put that. I see You’re saying just like in management consulting firms, there’s always more management consulting, more ways to improve. Same thing here. Alex: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: Sorry, I’m, I’m asking Chad GPT right now. How big is the third party engineering business? Andrew Warner: Well, the, the engineering part I get it’s the AI transformation company. Do you, at some point you, but those are gonna just Jesse Pujji: blend, right Andrew? Yeah, Andrew Warner: that’s what I, that’s what it seems like. Makes sense. That at some point it does need to be ongoing engineering work. Otherwise you can’t keep finding these places to cut human beings out. It eventually you’ve cut out all the human beings from the process. Let’s Jesse Pujji: stop using the word ai. ’cause the, the word AI is stupid. The real word is I can, I can build technology for you cheaper and faster than I used to be able to AI Arman: and not just build it, but also Jesse Pujji: ai. But, but like, yeah, Arman: yeah, Jesse Pujji: exactly. No, but that, like, that’s what you’re actually, the whole reason this is an opportunity is ’cause there’s tools and like our ability, Andrew, to like figure out content on our, on my posts and whatever, or like any of these things. We just would not have said yes to them before. If we had gone to Adam three years ago and said, Hey, Jesse’s gonna talk on pod, on like podcasts. You need to figure out how to take what he’s saying and turn that into written content. He would’ve been like, what? I need an NLP this and I need a database thing, this, and I need, and it’s like, dude, it would’ve been, he would’ve been sure I can do it for $3 million and I need six months to do that. And now it’s something they can do in a week because of ai. Andrew Warner: I see. So the ongoing opportunities to do work will keep coming up. So even if it’s some point, you get rid of the efficiency. There are new things to be built. Alex, I’m watching you. You’re, it’s either my connection is really bad that’s making you anxious, or there’s something you want to say and I’m holding you back from saying it. What is it? Alex: Because I think your, your gut reaction is a very natural reaction. Like, I actually, I, I think I’ve thought about this like, uh, my, my kind of like, um, it’s like the Jesse Pujji: old Indian uncle reaction. Alex: I was gonna say my, I used Jesse Pujji: to tell people we buy ads, ads on Facebook for people. The old Indian uncles would like, why can’t they grow tons themselves? What, what do they need you for? Alex: Yeah, I was, I was gonna say like my, my, um. My, my Jewish oc OCD is acting up right now. And what I’m thinking to myself is like, yeah, I’ve had this thought before and the way that I kind of think about it is similar to what Jesse Pujji: this is. Like Alex’s cold sweat dreams. You’re saying them as a fellow member of the tribe and he’s like, oh shit. Yeah. Why do they need us, Andrew? Alex: Oh no. The one question he wasn’t supposed to ask. Um, no, but I think there’s a few things. One is, I ultimately, the, the way that I think about it is like, consulting firms really just like are an index or like they latch onto being a, a growth and strategic partner for a business. And, and kind of the anchor for that is the partner who has the relationship with the CEO. And so the CEO whenever the, the CEO has cold sweats at night, uh, the CEO e’s not texting his best friend. He is texting his partner at Bain or BCG, or McKinsey. The way I think about it is AI is this incredible. Wedge into being a company’s growth partner and strategic partner in 2025. And so even if you’re right, let’s just say our, my deepest fear and your deepest fear is right, which is you run out of things to do what I still think is there. Every business me need support, every business, some size needs support to grow and needs help to unstuck problems. And there are a lot of problems to unstuck. Even if the solution isn’t always ai. Jesse Pujji: Just think of, here’s a simple way to think. Well first of all, let’s actually play a game. I just Googled or chat GB td this. How big do you think the, I just said how big is third party engineering as an industry? Yep. And everyone think about your answers, prices, right? Rule applies. Alex: Okay. Jesse Pujji: Andrew, you go first, Mr. Skeptical? Andrew Warner: Uh, I would say quarter trillion dollars. Okay, Jesse Pujji: so that’s 250 billion? Andrew Warner: Yeah. Jesse Pujji: Okay, Alex, A Alex: year. Uh, 49 billion. Jesse Pujji: Okay. Armand, Alex: we all of third party engineering. So like dead shop external Arman: engineering. Alex: Yeah. Arman: Oh, over a trillion for sure. Jesse Pujji: All over the place. Okay. Well, the, the right guy was right. It’s, this has a reasonable ballpark is one two, 3 trillion annually. Woo. So, dude, it’s, it’s another way to think about it. Like, you think about these cloud services guys, Andrew, and like, they’re like, you, you, I think you’re getting so close to the problem. You’re forgetting the business need, which is like, why did someone need a Salesforce implementation shop? Well, the real reason is ’cause they needed A CRM. Well, why They needed A CRM because they needed to track their customers and manage their customers and follow up with their customers. Then they needed a software to do it, then they needed a service provider on top of the software to implement it. And so the point is, these things all have to start with business problems. And I think what Alex was saying before about McKinsey is, do you think businesses will stop having problems if your answer is no? Then they’ll continue to have a business in helping them solve their problems, which happens to be using that, the modality. Today’s ai, 20 years ago it was, it was cloud services, right? 20 years before that, it was like, we’ll put up your mainframe and your thing and we’ll do whatever you need there. And it’s gotten bigger as there’s been more and more stuff, and everyone’s using more of it. Andrew Warner: So are we all agreeing that AI transformation is the beginning of the relationship, but it’s not the long term business, and then at some point something needs to come up? You either become the person who, when the CEO is sweating in the middle of the night, they call you, as Alex said, or as Jesse said, you keep finding other things to do and either way, you’re the support system and you happen to be using software or whatever that Jesse Pujji: software is. Yeah. Or, or Alex, we’ve been spending a lot of time looking at the, like, as new tools and technologies pop up, there’s gonna need the equivalent of implementation businesses. And so someone’s gonna, some, some tool that we can’t even think of today is gonna launch on top of anthropic or whatever. Everyone’s gonna go, wow, that solves this one problem for me, that, you know, engages my employees. Now I need to eng engage, like I need someone to implement that for me, and so on and so forth. Sorry, Alex, Alex: what were you gonna say? I, I think mm-hmm. Andrew, to your question, I think AI is a tool in the toolkit that solves business problems. And ultimately, if you want to build a huge business, it, my view is, is it isn’t the only tool you’re gonna rely on. Andrew Warner: Armand told me early before Armand told me before we got started, there’s a lot of fomo. You hear that AI can transform, you call, uh, 10 x, you say, I heard it can transform. Go and look around my company and tell me what’s going on. And people will get a will, will then find ways to improve the business. That’s, that’s why this whole thing is so sexy in the beginning. Alright, I wanna do a few demos here. Can you both do a screen share and show me a few things here? Alex: Yeah, for sure. So first, um, what do you guys use to, do you guys use EOS? Jesse Pujji: We have, yeah, we use elements of it. Alex: Okay, cool. So something. That I always found, like I fe, so EOS, just as, just to give quick, uh, background, it’s like OKRs, it’s a business operating system. My whole thing is I don’t like thinking about the rhythm of running my business and the processes and I don’t wanna invent them from scratch. EOS is a system for running your business. Um, we at Morning Brew we self-implemented, meaning we read a book called Traction by Gino Wickman, and then we implemented what was talked about in the book. A lot of people hire actual implementers, um, who either run your offsites, help you with ES implementation and they charge a shit ton of money. Like, you know, they, they, it could be like $15,000 a day for being at your offsite or, uh, with implementation. So what I wanted to do was basically build an EOS implementer. ’cause I’m implementing EOS at 10 X right now. And so I’ll just take you guys through this quickly. So EOS facilitator basically built a custom GPT. And the way that I think about custom gpt is it’s, it’s basically just a, almost like a persistent chat GPT instance. So it’s the, you know, instead of me having a one-off conversation with chat GPT and then it falls into the abyss of all my conversations, if there’s a conversation that I’m going to want to revisit frequently. If it’s something, if it’s a tool that I’m gonna wanna share with other people in my business, and if I’m gonna want it to operate with context that like on an ongoing basis, then I think about building a custom GPT. So we look under the hood here in this E-O-S-G-P-T. Basically the way it’s configured is I have uploaded the actual book Traction by Gino Wickman. I found the PDF of the book uploaded that. I uploaded the VTO, like all of like the, the frameworks you fill out to, to implement traction. What I actually haven’t implo, uh, uh, uploaded here, but it’s something I’m gonna do is take our knowledge base for 10 x so our org chart information about our clients and upload it here. So then EOS has, or this implementer has full knowledge about our business. And then the instructions are basically the way in which this custom GPT is supposed to interface with me. And just for context, the way that I always approach creating these instructions is I just have chat GBT five PRO create a prompt. So I asked it to create a prompt that would act as kind of the instructions for my EOS implementer. And so just to give you an example of what this looks like in practice. Um, and, and, and also like in terms of the model, and this is something Arman and I talked about a, a bunch. I just used GPT five PRO on this. It’s like the most powerful model that GPT has. It takes longer, but it’s just very good at reasoning. So one thing that I was doing today with it is I wanted to create the accountability chart for 10 x. And so what I literally did is I just had a conversation with my implementer. So I said, can you help me create my accountability chart? Said yes. And then it took us through the di directions for creating the accountability chart. The accountability chart is like, what are the key functions in your business? It’s about, um, roles, not seats or people. And then it asks questions. And so what I like about this is it acts as like my facilitator. ’cause it’s just asking questions to gather information. Mm-hmm. To complete the accountability chart. So then I said, we’re 10 x, we have 12 team members. We have both visionary and integrator. Our core functions, our sales and marketing products and client success and ops. It fills those out. Then it says, do you have five key responsibilities per seat, which is what the accountability chart has. I had already created it, so I shared an image, and so then it just filled in what the roles per every seat were. And then it asked a few follow-up questions all and went through the full thing. We have a full accountability chart now, and then the next step is you look at everyone in your company and you look at are do they get it, want it, and have the capacity to do it? Like are they right for the roles you have in your company? And so then it created this whole table that now our leadership team at 10 X is gonna fill out to know of like everyone is right for their role at the company. So that’s just one example of how I basically turned traction the book and like all of the guidelines into my facilitator. Yeah, so this doesn’t have to be like a single player experience. And one thing I’ll say is I’ve found this very helpful because I am very much an external processor and so I find it way easier to have someone questioning me than me trying to, in my own head, self implement EOS. Andrew Warner: I’m like that too. I need that conversation and voice ideally. Alex: Yep. Andrew Warner: Okay. And I’m looking over on the left side of your screen, and I can see that you also have an AI coach, which I think is trained on another book, and Alex: Yep. This Andrew Warner: one was, you’ve done this for different aspects of your Alex: business. Yep. This one was, this one was trained on, um, Mabo, Charlie’s great. CEO within mm-hmm. And then also info about 10 x. So I, I actually use this all the time. Like we were just talking about, uh, Armand and I were talking about like, um, did we want to give a bonus to a certain employee? What should that bonus be and what are the trade-offs? We, I went through the conversation here and what it suggested is what we ended up going with, and it’s scripted what our conversation should be when we meet with that employee to share their bonus. That’s awesome. But set the right expectations. That’s, Andrew Warner: that’s fantastic. Yeah. Okay. Uh, Amron, you got a, you’ve got something you wanna show too, right? Arman: Alex mentioned, uh, developers are living in the future and the tool du like Jesse, earlier you mentioned Curs. Our engineers would call you a boomer for using cursor like that is like so yesterday. Um, and so love it. The tools that are like the big ones right now are Codex, CLI and Claude code CLI. Um, so to those who’ve never seen this interface or think this is scary, this is basically what’s called a command line interface. So if you’re on Mac and you open what’s called terminal, like you just go terminal, um, it’ll open. And then on Windows, I think it’s something similar, uh, term. If you search term, it’ll open. So if you, um, open up terminal and you download Claude then or Claude Code, which you could just do from the website, then when you type in Claude, it basically opens up this program, uh, called Claude Code. And so you could just talk to it. You could say, um, I am Arman, uh, or actually here, let me, who is Jesse Fuji? Did I spell that right? Andrew Warner: Mm-hmm. Okay. Arman: Uh, search. The web and give me a brief bio. So it basically goes and does some research and it says, okay, I wanna do web search. Jesse Fuge, bio entrepreneur. Yes. So this is like a very simple use case, but uh, we will get nuts in a minute. So, cool. Serial entrepreneur, blah, blah. Okay. Um, so let’s actually say, um, I want to build a competitor to am push. Alex: Oh shit. Arman: Um, please write me a business plan in a markdown document to do so. Start by doing research. Um, spin up at least three sub-agents running in parallel. One should study. And push and its competitors. Alex: Andrew Buckle. In Arman: another study, go to market Alex: business model to a third one Arman: and how we, uh, acquire customers. And the third should study business model. Use the internet to do that. Then come back and write the report. Cool. So first it’s like, let me understand what this guy wants, and then you’ll see in a moment it’ll spin up three. So this is one subagent research, aush and competitors. This is the second subagent research go to market and customer acquisition. And then this is the third subagent research business model options. And now each one is running. Each one is doing its own searches, as you can see. And I need to approve each of them. But you know what, I’m just gonna say yes. And don’t ask again for web search commands. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. Yes. And don’t ask again. I’m just gonna say yes ’cause it’s not listening again, Andrew Warner: because it wants to make sure that you, you’re comfortable with the number of tokens it’s using. Arman: Using, yeah. So you can change modes. So you can go to, I think it’s control shift or command shift or something. Shift, I dunno what it’s, but there’s some command where you can like change modes and you can go into planning mode where it won’t do anything. It’ll just write a plant. There is, uh, auto accept mode or like, we call it yellow mode where it just says, screw it. I’m just gonna, you, I’m not gonna ask you for permission, I’m just gonna do whatever. Alex: And, and just so you guys have context, like one thing I learned in just watching Armand and the different engineers work with Claude Code is the reason it was such a kind of like incredible, um. Like piece of software. And, and the reason also like was it sounded at 3.7 that was incredible is because of its ability to have tool use, like to basically access tools, external tools to do work. Arman: Yeah. Alex: And it was other models before this were not nearly as good as doing this. Arman: Yeah. Alex: Tools like what, Arman: like task like web search. Like it, so, so there is so much going be going on behind the scenes. There’s a lot of people who’ve like reverse engineered cloud code to understand how it works. There’s a lot of really cool techniques like injecting reminders to tell the agent, Hey, don’t forget this, whatever. It’s really, really involved, but it’s really good for, and that makes it really good for coding because it work, it, it basically forces the agent to stay on task, but that makes it useful for other things too. And that’s kind of one of my goals is to get people who aren’t engineers using this. So as this is going, I’m actually gonna show you another, another example. Okay. So this is still running over here in this window, but over here. I’m going to kill this. Clear it, and then I’m going to say Claude. Um, and I’m gonna say open up LinkedIn, uh, LinkedIn’s website or webpage. Open up LinkedIn. Why am I speaking? Why am I like being weird? Open up LinkedIn. Yes. I wanna proceed cools. Andrew Warner: So now open up, it opens up a tab in a new browser window. Arman: Yep. That opens up a tab in a new browser window. I’m gonna say search for Andrew Warner, founder of Mixergy. Okay. It’s taking a snapshot to make sure it did the right job, but as it’s doing that founder of Mixergy and send him a dm, tell him, oh wow, Alex: this was, Arman: um, or this was sent by Claude. So now. To, yeah, lemme try to manage these windows. So I’m gonna put them side by side here. Okay. So it’s asking, yes, I wanna proceed. So it’s gonna click on search Combox, but now that I resize that it needs to reorient itself and Alex: Armand’s using a tool called Playwright, which, which basically allows you to interface with web pages. Arman: Yeah. Which is actually, it’s, it’s an MCP. It’s super easy to install. Um, and it’s free. So anybody can do this. So now it’s going, it, it searched for Andrew. There Andrew Warner: he is. It found me right there. The one search result. Okay. Arman: Yep. That man is so handsome. Good looking guy. Jesse Pujji: The machines are alive. Andrew Warner: What Arman: Now? See, it’s saying message button for Andrew Warner. Andrew Warner: Because it identified the message about not its own. Arman: Yep, exactly. Andrew Warner: And knew that’s what it needed for the dm. Arman: And now it’s looking at it like it actually looks at the code. So now it just opened up the message window, see that? And now it just put, this was sent by Claude Code and to round out our magic trick, it’s gonna take a screenshot just so that it can wind up and it’s gonna send that, I’m really trying to buy time for quote code. Yeah. And now it’s gonna click the send button and it’s sent. So Andrew, if you can confirm, this is Andrew Warner: by cloud cloud code. It went through from Alex to me. Jesse Pujji: Where does all this go in, in your guys’ mind? Where does all this go? Like Armand, what’s the pace at which, I mean this stuff is obviously, it’s really cool, it’s a little slow if you’re trying to do something. It takes, it takes a long time. But what’s Jesse Pujji: gonna happen in like six months or a year in, in your opinion? Arman: So what’s interesting is that this example. Technologically speaking, this was possible over a year ago, right? Why is this not the norm? I would argue that it’s for the exact reason that like, for the exact problem that we’re solving, it’s hard to implement. Like this is a cool magic trick, but to understand how you implement this is actually difficult. So one of the things that, that Alex and I talk about a lot is when people argue, Hey, um, Claude Code or Cursor or whatever, AI is not as good as I am at writing code. That’s what a lot of engineers will say, but a lot of people outside of engineering will say similar things. They’ll say, ai, AI is not as good as as me at X, so I can’t use it to that. I say basically, if you have a free or near free junior employee and you can’t, and you have unlimited versions of this, you could spin up infinite. Numbers of these near free junior employees. If you can’t find a way to generate leverage from that, that’s a skill issue. Right? Jesse Pujji: Right. Arman: Now, if we take that curve and we take the cost of intelligence, I would argue that this is intelligence, right? If you take the cost of intelligence and you, and you ask them, tote that towards zero, what you see is people will 10 x or they will go towards zero. And it, and, and if you, if people have the ability to architect, right, whether it’s code and they wanna architect it, or in this case, if you are a really good recruiter and the only thing that was holding you back is your ability to message a ton of people or whatever it may be, if the only thing in the way of success was just time, you’re going to succeed. Jesse Pujji: But my, sorry, my question was a little different. Where do you see the technology going for like. Is this gonna happen in three, like in one second in the future now? Or like, is it gonna, I mean, that seems like to be the obvious thing, that it’s gonna go faster, better, smarter. Like how do you guys think about that? Alex: Yeah, I mean, if you read the, um, I’m forgetting his name now. Uh, we could LinkedIn in the show notes, but there was just a piece written by a guy who was a, is or was a researcher at one of the frontier labs. And he is like, everyone basically talks about how like the models are slowing down in their improvement chat. G PT wasn’t that good. And what he basically posits is like we as humans are just really good at getting used to things that felt like science fiction, feeling like nonfiction anymore. And the the, uh, the gold line just keeps moving in crazy ways, right? And you actually map out the, the, basically there’s these independent orgs that do a mapping of every new model basically. How long can the model run for? And still have a 50%, um, success rate of whatever the task was that it was doing. And when GBT three came out, I wanna say it was like, it was like three seconds or four seconds, Arman: right? Alex: And now it’s like, it’s at like an hour. And if you actually look at the charting of this, it is still exponential in how long that these tasks can run for. And the reason they look at that is it’s like entropy. The longer a task is, the more, uh, likely it is that a model will start, like spinning its wheels and all these things. And so if you just look at this like it is still exponential, and he would argue that basically you’re gonna be able to have a true digital employee, meaning it can do 24 hours a day of work without you checking on it by 2027. Arman: Yeah, I, I would be more bullish than that person. I would say that it’s actually much sooner. I think in terms of the, um. To nerd out on this for a moment. Uh, I think if the way, like if you think about this in terms of like using humans as an analogy, the base models are, are appearing to asymptote, right? They’re appearing to either asymptote or the growth of the speed of growth is slowing. Most of the growth now is coming at, whether it be the application layer or the fine tuning layer or whatever, or that type of like adding intelligence on top or adding ability on top of like core iq. And with the stuff that I just showed, like adding what I call arms and legs, right? And so like, if you want to use the human being as the parallel, the base model is basically a newborn baby. They’re born with a brain, but we need to spend a lifetime teaching that person how to be a human. They need to grow, they need to get coordinated, they need to be able to do shit right. And that’s what the models can’t do right now. That is make, that is happening much, much faster. I think that is the part that all the money and time and intelligence is going towards. So I think the next year raci a lot of, like when GPT-3 0.5 was first announced, they were advertising they could write a fucking haiku. Jesse Pujji: Right Arman: now we’re actually getting to the like, let’s actually do shit. Let’s get it to actually do work. And I think that that’s gonna accelerate over the next 12 months. Jesse Pujji: What’s your take on like human in the loop AI versus, I mean, again, there’s like this, some arguments like no, the humans are gonna be, you don’t need them. They’re versus human in the loop. Like how do you guys answer that or think about that? Arman: People think about AI as like something that’s out of our control. Like, oh, it’s inevitable that AI is going to take over because of course it’s going to, right? Like it’s the self-fulfilling prophecy. I think that what people forget is that it’s a statistical model that is in our control to make it better. Not only are we in control of making it better, but we’re in control of making it better in the ways that we want it to be better, right? And so if we as humans want it to be really, really good at something, it’s going to get good at that thing. By nature of free markets and intelligence and all these things, if we don’t want it to be good at something, it’s less likely to be good at that thing. And so I am not necessarily worried that humanity is going to replace ourselves because it’s in our control. I think I am concerned about different, like, like some people who run these giant companies, I don’t think care about the things that I’m describing here. I think they actually just wanna see how far AI can be pushed and how much humans can be replaced. But frankly, that’s part of why I was excited about like starting 10 x. That’s part of the initial essay that I wrote is to. Compete against that and to make sure that humans are in the loop, but in a way that we want to be in the loop. Can we think humans are put here Jesse Pujji: to create part Can, hold on. Mike, can you bring that down one level that the philosophical aspect of it makes sense to me? I’m curious, like there’s a version of this where, again, the future is so automated and blah, blah, blah. There’s another version where like, humans make the AI better through the things that make them human. And then AI makes humans better through like output and stuff. Like, do you believe that, how do you guys think about the, like, you know, again, there’s that AI won’t replace you. A human who uses AI will replace you. Like, do you believe that, and I mean that more, less from the, like your, your worldview and more from like a specific, the way work gets done with AI in the future now and in the future. Alex: Yeah. Well, I mean, my one thing I would say just specifically to the, the truism you just said is I really just think it is like bullshit and like basically every executive is like on one hand being like. How can I use AI in my company? On the other hand is saying, um, how do I make sure my people aren’t worried about it? And then behind closed doors is saying, this is a hundred percent gonna wipe out a ton of jobs in my company. Jesse Pujji: Right? Alex: Um, so look, I mean, Armand will have a smarter thought here, but my, my general view is like, if we view, like I view AI today as like this incredible junior employee that just like a great junior employee is high agency, high effort. You, uh, you delegate, uh, like you build up trust initially with like, really, uh, defining parameters. And as it earns trust, you allow it to do more without you checking in on it. As intelligence gets better and better, I do think you end up getting like employees, quote unquote employees that look more and more like senior employees, which just means like at the end of the day, what’s a job of an executive? It really becomes around like orchestration. And now where I’m not smart enough is. What is the point at which it becomes intelligent enough that it is good enough? It, it can orchestrate well as well. I don’t know, I don’t know the answer to that and I don’t know if anyone does. I don’t know if you have thoughts on it. Like if your question is like, are we out of jobs, uh, in the next five to 10 years? IWI would put it at a non-zero chance, but until that point, we’re enjoying working on this problem. Jesse Pujji: How are you guys thinking about the framework for your margins and your growth as a services business? Arman: What do you mean? Like frameworks? Like what is our goal or Jesse Pujji: it’s a really, really important thing. So, so here’s, here’s what typically happens with services, businesses and how they go south, right? One is pipeline, like the amount of work getting done versus clients that are coming in like you’re selling people, right? And I don’t mean that in a weird way, but that’s what you’re doing fundamentally. And typically what happens is service delivery and customer acquisition, they start to bleed in a bad way, which means. Oh, like you have this pipeline, then the pipeline gets too busy because you still need to be involved probably in certain ways. And like then that’s one way you start to get into this, like this sort of swinging. The other big way that’s related is then margins, creep. Margins go down, right? And margins typically go down because scope creeps up by the client. You’re not, people aren’t paying attention to it all. Like I see a lot of services businesses where they’re just not even paying attention to it. I talked to an agency couple weeks ago and I was like, what’s your pod level margin? They’re like, we have no idea. What are you talking about? And they weren’t directly, they could do the high level number. Yeah. They could say, here’s the total revenue, here’s my total headcount. And then some clients are 10% margin and others are 70%. Yeah. And, and so there’s a lot of frameworks. I think that, you know, it’s important for you guys to build to, to crush this, uh, to start to think about some of these questions more directly. And I, maybe you have, maybe you haven’t, but, but that’s sort of just what I meant by that. Arman: I mean, we have the margin down to the day, like, like we know our margin per employee because we’re, we generate, we charge on output and we pay on output and everyone’s aligned. And so we’re very, very strict with, um, thinking about that. And again, the goal is so that we can reinvest in the company and, and um, and build IP for the customers. And so it’s basically that flywheel. So what Jesse Pujji: drives your margins up versus down? Alex: One is that every additional time we do work, there’s less human. There’s actually less cost of labor that goes into that work. That’s cool. Yeah. One, one example for that would be like, um, and this goes into like how we ultimately wanna monetize the business different than typically service businesses. What does it look like if Andrew, let’s just use an example for, um, I’ll, I’ll just use an example for let’s, we were talking to a business there, sellers spend. More than 50% of their time not selling. We are talking about building basically just like an A sales co-pilot for them that does a lot of like SDR and sales ops work. While this business is like a healthcare business, 90% of the bones of this agent can be applied to every other business that has a sales function. What does it look like for us to basically, one, build this agent at cost as 10 x and then charge them based on usage of the agent, but then also every additional time we work with customers, then potentially need, right. A sales agent build, it’s effectively Lego blocks for doing that over and over. Right. Right. And so the margin increases every time we do that. Jesse Pujji: No, I love that. Well, but, so one of the issues with output based pricing, right, just to flag it for you guys, is Yeah. What happens when the client, like, what happens when the output isn’t good and you’ve committed to the output, so all of a sudden you, you, you know, let’s say your costs are 50 grand. You’re selling it for a hundred grand in this example, and they go, we don’t like this. And you’re like, fuck, I gotta put another month’s worth of work into it for whatever reason. Client’s unhappy, maybe they’re jackass and they didn’t listen when you were scoping it and vice versa, whatever. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Then what happens is you spend another month and now all of a sudden your margins went from 50 to 30%. Alex: It really is just a question of is it realistic to fully incentive align you with a customer? Because if you were to truly incentive align, I guess it would be like truly value-based where it’d be like, if this outcome happens in your business, we get paid. And I know like the big consultancies do this. Um, I mean, I guess my question for you is like, do you, do you just think that’s not realistic for service businesses to charge based on value or, or output? Jesse Pujji: No, not at all. I mean, that’s what we did at Ambush, right? I mean, we charged that way. It’s just you have to build the infrastructure. There’s a lot of pieces that are, that require like more thoughtfulness than you might think. For example, like. One of the, one of the quotes, like Rick would always say, and this is in a marketing context, right? ’cause we would take on people’s marketing and we’d promise them better results. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: Right? And it’s like, well, at first you’re like, wow, these guys will take a risk. And they’ll, and it’s well, but what’s really happening is like, we’re like an investor, we’re underwriting the opportunity. Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: So, and, and the line was like, never, you know, be like, Floyd Mayweather, never take on a fight. You can’t win. Alex: Totally. Yeah. You just back the duck. Jesse Pujji: Yeah. Well, specifically though, in your, in our case, it was like we already knew the levers we would pull to be able to reduce their CPAs or grow their volume by a certain amount. And we didn’t always work, but we were very confident. More often than not, it would work. And so for you guys, when you think about costing based on outputs, what you’re gonna find pretty soon is you’re gonna want to narrow the things at, you start to focus on, like your example of the SDR thing. Because then, you know, you can keep delivering it, delivering it, it delivering it. And you’re gonna have a built in margin model versus the more wide, like Alex: Yep. Jesse Pujji: You know, wide, industry wide problem set. That, that, that runs into that problem, which is like you, if you can’t start to predict it, it starts to really take a big hit on your Alex: margins. Jesse Pujji: Yeah, Alex: I think that, I think that makes total sense. One last thought, ’cause I know you, like, you basically talked about acquisition costs, um, and like delivery, moving the wrong direction. You know, one of the things that I’ve wanted to do since leaving Morning Brew is effectively build morning Brew on top of a better business model. And, um, and so ultimately the goal is to build kind of 10 X media on top of 10 x, where there’s only one place that executives go to to make AI more actionable. And that’s like the hook again. And over time, it can develop into not solely around ai. Um, and so that’s the idea is a combination of brand and personality driven franchises that make AI actionable for kind of the next generation of leaders that are trying to transform their businesses. Andrew Warner: Come on guys. Now tell the audience your revenue. Can we say more than 10 million? Alex: Sorry. Uh, Andrew, you’re cutting out. Yeah, Andrew Warner: it must be your connect. Cool. End it here. Gentlemen. Congratulations on the success. Thanks so much for doing this, Armand. I’m seeing you wince like you’re regretting the friendship we even had. Just because I’ve pushed it too far. I’ll win you back later. I’ve Jesse Pujji: got an awkward question for Armand. Why is this business not on your LinkedIn? It’s, uh, it’s going on there. Okay. Okay. Good. © Mixergy 2025 Mixergy is a mission. Thanks for liking this post. If you're a premium member, you can save your likes. Login or become a premium member.

Title: Bank of America prioritizes bigger AI initiatives, as annual spending on new tech increased by 44% over the past decade

Time Published: 2025-11-05T19:30:06Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Bank of America’s annual spending on new, strategic technology initiatives, which includes investments in artificial intelligence, has increased by 44% over the past decade to reach $4 billion in 2025. The executive that’s steering those investments is Hari Gopalkrishnan, a 14-year veteran who was promoted to serve as the chief technology and information officer in late July. Today at Bank of America’s investor day event, Gopalkrishnan will outline the vision for these strategic tech bets and discuss how they tie into the broader $118 billion in tech investments that the company has made over the past decade. It is the first time leadership has held this event in 15 years and Gopalkrishnan, CEO Brian Moynihan, and other C-suite leaders will face investors as Bank of America’s stock has lagged the five other large U.S. banks for the past five years. “We have steadily increased our spend in technology, now up to $13 billion a year, of which $4 billion goes into strategic growth,” Gopalkrishnan tells Fortune ahead of his one-hour investor day panel discussion with two other Bank of America technologists. “We leverage across the enterprise, so every dollar you spend gets the maximum bang for the buck, as opposed to sort of being siloed by line of business.” That means that when Gopalkrishnan deploys new AI tools and functionality, he will prioritize applications that can scale across all eight lines of business, which includes global capital markets, consumer lending, and retail banking. One example of this in action is Erica, an AI virtual assistant that’s surpassed three billion client interactions since the tool launched in 2018. It now averages more than 58 million interactions per month, facilitating chatbot conversations with clients, proactively altering them on changes to their past spending patterns or flagging when they may have been double-charged by a merchant, and answering banking questions. The tool is currently available on Bank of America’s mobile app, but will expand next year to the desktop. In 2020, Bank of America launched Erica for Employees, an internal version of the tool that more than 90% of the company’s global workforce of 213,000 now uses regularly. Erica has helped reduce the number of calls into the company’s IT service desk by 50%. The banking sector has embraced generative AI capabilities at a faster pace than most sectors, with investments focused on AI-enabled chatbots, virtual assistants that can summarize financial documents, fraud monitoring, and assisting employees as they navigate complex international regulatory changes. Generative, predictive, and other forms of AI collectively are projected to generate as much as $340 billion annually in value creation for the global banking sector, consulting giant McKinsey has estimated. Financial giants, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, have also been steadily rolling out new generative AI tools to more employees throughout 2025. At Bank of America, Gopalkrishnan says he’s less incentivized to focus his investments on AI tools that can save a couple minutes on simplistic workplace tasks. “When you look at the end-to-end client journey, they involve like 40-plus processes and thousands of employees,” says Gopalkrishnan. “You start to pick apart that process and reimagine it. That’s when you get ROI.” Bank of America has explored more than 45 different “proof of concept” use cases for generative AI , with 15 of them commercially live today. Some of the priority use cases that Gopalkrishnan is deploying include tools that can summarize or offer search functionality for capital markets and investment banking employees, making it easier to pull real-time market commentary. An in-house built “AskGPS” tool, which was trained on over 3,200 internal documents and presentations, allows employees to ask complex questions on behalf of clients and receive responses within seconds. Bank of America has also invested $1.5 billion into the company’s data capabilities over the past five years, which Gopalkrishnan says was critical to create a foundation that allowed for more AI adoption. Within the technology department, Gopalkrishnan has deployed AI coding assistants that are used by 18,000 developers. There has already been a 20% productivity lift to select parts of the development life cycle that Bank of America has focused its efforts on. Gopalkrishnan says he’s mostly leaning on one unnamed vendor to support AI-enabled code assistance, but is continuing to explore other tools on a smaller scale. His intent is to standardize the application of these AI coding tools over time to as few vendors as possible. More than 130,000 Bank of America employees are currently authorized to use the enterprise productivity tools and by the end of the year, everyone will have access to them. Bank of America has sought to motivate its workforce by offering AI learning programs that begin by teaching the basics of AI, but also more advanced prompt engineering training. “It’s really a combination of training, education, giving them exposure to the tools, and then ongoing commitment to reskill, as the work changes,” says Gopalkrishnan. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech earnings highlight cracks in AI’s valuation halo. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon have all spent billions to support their AI initiatives—and all four told investors last week that they will increase spending even more in 2026. Investors have consistently supported the AI boom over the past few years, though that enthusiasm showed some notable cracks in the latest earnings season, as Microsoft and Meta Platforms both saw their stocks fall amid concerns for the lofty levels of spending needed to support their AI ambitions. What’s vexing investors is: AI is generating billions of dollars in revenue and bottom-line efficiencies, but exactly how much, at what pace, and at what price? That investment thesis still needs time to marinate as these tech giants have added debt to support their AI spending. OpenAI strikes a big compute deal with Amazon; projects massive revenue growth. On Monday, OpenAI inked a deal to buy $38 billion worth of compute from Amazon and will immediately start to access Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The partnership is notable as it is one of OpenAI’s first big moves away from Microsoft, who the AI startup had an exclusive cloud agreement with up until this year. Separately, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated more bullish expectations for revenue growth, sharing that annual revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year. When asked by the Bg2 Pod about revenue estimates exceeding $100 billion a year by 2028 or 2029, Altman responded: “How about ‘27?” Nvidia makes history as the first-ever company worth $5 trillion. Last week, AI chipmaker Nvidia officially became the world’s first company to achieve a market capitalization north of $5 trillion, pulling ahead of tech rivals like Microsoft and Apple, who are each worth close to $4 trillion. The latest stock market gains came after Nvidia’s GTC developer conference, where CEO Jensen Huang disclosed that the company had secured more than $500 billion in orders for its AI chips through the end of next year. Major new deals that have been unveiled the past several days have included partnerships with Eli Lilly, Uber Technologies, and Johnson & Johnson. Bloomberg reports that Nvidia is now larger than six of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index and the entire value of equity markets of most countries. Hiring spree: AI companies are seeking more “forward-deployed engineers.” This year, job advertisements have been soaring for a new specialist software developer who can write code, but also is adept at talking to customers. By hiring more forward-deployed engineers, AI hyperscalers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Cohere would aim to make their AI models more specialized and useful for companies, thus generating bigger contracts and more revenue. The Financial Times reports that job advertisements for these roles have increased more than 800% between January and September of 2025, citing data from the jobs platform Indeed. Firms that prioritize AI governance are also generating stronger returns from their investments. A recent EY survey of 975 C-suite leaders across 21 countries found that while nearly every company had already suffered financial losses from AI-related incidents—with average damages “conservatively” exceeding $4.4 million—the enterprises that had stronger governance measures like real-time monitoring and oversight committees were seeing far fewer damages. And notably, those organizations are also seeing stronger returns from their AI investments: 34% more likely to see improvements in revenue growth and 65% more likely to produce cost savings. “When I look at that data, what it tells me is that those companies are taking AI more seriously,” says Joe Depa, EY’s global chief innovation officer. “That means they’re likely training and talking about how to leverage AI, both ethically, but also from a productivity standpoint.” The survey also found that members of the C-suite may still be struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of change as AI technologies advance. On average, when asked to identify the appropriate controls against five AI-related risks, including hallucinations and bias, only 12% of the C-suite respondents answered correctly. CTOs and CIOs did the best (26% and 24%, respectively), while chief operating officers (6%) and chief marketing officers (3%) were at the bottom of the list.

Bloomberg reports that Nvidia is now larger than six of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index and the entire value of equity markets of most countries. Hiring spree: AI companies are seeking more “forward-deployed engineers.” This year, job advertisements have been soaring for a new specialist software developer who can write code, but also is adept at talking to customers. By hiring more forward-deployed engineers, AI hyperscalers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Cohere would aim to make their AI models more specialized and useful for companies, thus generating bigger contracts and more revenue. The Financial Times reports that job advertisements for these roles have increased more than 800% between January and September of 2025, citing data from the jobs platform Indeed. Firms that prioritize AI governance are also generating stronger returns from their investments. A recent EY survey of 975 C-suite leaders across 21 countries found that while nearly every company had already suffered financial losses from AI-related incidents—with average damages “conservatively” exceeding $4.4 million—the enterprises that had stronger governance measures like real-time monitoring and oversight committees were seeing far fewer damages. And notably, those organizations are also seeing stronger returns from their AI investments: 34% more likely to see improvements in revenue growth and 65% more likely to produce cost savings. “When I look at that data, what it tells me is that those companies are taking AI more seriously,” says Joe Depa, EY’s global chief innovation officer. “That means they’re likely training and talking about how to leverage AI, both ethically, but also from a productivity standpoint.” The survey also found that members of the C-suite may still be struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of change as AI technologies advance. On average, when asked to identify the appropriate controls against five AI-related risks, including hallucinations and bias, only 12% of the C-suite respondents answered correctly. CTOs and CIOs did the best (26% and 24%, respectively), while chief operating officers (6%) and chief marketing officers (3%) were at the bottom of the list.

Title: Here's What Wall Street Analysts Are Saying About AMD's Earnings

Advanced Micro Devices investors have become harder to impress. The chipmaker yesterday posted record quarterly results and an upbeat outlook on surging demand for its data center chips—and its stock has hardly budged. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up about 2%, near $255, in recent trading as the broader tech sector looked to rebound from yesterday's sell-off. Here's a roundup of what Wall Street analysts said about AMD after last night's results. This year's big stock gains for chipmakers like AMD have given rise to worries about an AI bubble. The weak reaction to AMD's strong results could underscore growing uncertainty around the sector—or, at least, the rich valuations carried by stocks in it. Analysts at Oppenheimer, who maintained a neutral rating, voiced some concerns about AMD's reputation as a "second horse supplier" to AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA), preferring to stay on the sidelines while waiting to see more from AMD's ability to compete with its AI strategy. Most Wall Street analysts, however, remain bullish on the chipmaker's stock amid expectations of growing market share for AMD. Jefferies and HSBC analysts, who have "buy" or equivalent ratings for the stock and $300 price targets, said they came away from Tuesday's results convinced of AMD's potential for more AI-driven growth. HSBC called AMD's recent deal with OpenAI a "game changing" development. Wedbush, which boosted its target to $290 from $270, said it is looking forward to an Analyst Day event next Tuesday for more color on its roadmap. While Wall Street's targets and ratings may be in flux, the mean price target on AMD's shares is around $275 based on Visible Alpha data and Investopedia calculations. About twice as many analysts have "buy" ratings as have "holds," with no bearish ratings currently tracked by the service. Shares of AMD have more than doubled in 2025 so far, with much of its recent gains coming in the wake of the OpenAI deal announced last month.

Title: 4 signs that investors are rethinking the red-hot AI trade

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Investors hit the brakes on the AI trade this week. The market doesn't seem as confident about AI as it once was, evidenced by the sell-off that tore through the sector on Tuesday. Top leaders in the AI sector — including Nvidia, Meta, and Palantir — all tumbled, thanks largely to concerns that tech stocks have gone too far, too fast after years of stellar returns. The hype, in other words, doesn't seem as limitless as it did just a few weeks ago. Here were the warning signs the AI trade got from investors this week: Michael Burry broke a long period of silence to deliver a warning. After a two-year hiatus from social media, the famed "Big Short" investor made a cryptic post on X, where he occasionally issues warnings about the market and the economy to his followers. "Sometimes, we see bubbles," Burry wrote this week. "Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play." Burry's firm, Scion Asset Management, also placed bets against AI titans Palantir and Nvidia in the last quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. "Investors are sitting on huge stock market gains, and some might have taken profits today, especially in AI-related stocks, in response to Burry's filing news," Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note. Burry, who was one of the investors to call the housing bust ahead of the 2008 crisis, has a reputation for his persistently bearish takes on markets. In recent years, he's sounded the alarm about a potential stock crash and a recession, battling against consensus forecasts of continued strength and more gains ahead for stocks. Investors have begun paying attention to the elephant in the room: tech stocks have risent to meteoric valuations. That's been a concern in the market for years, but the discussion around whether some firms in the AI space are overvalued seemed to be front and center this week as investors surveyed the market after a breathless three-year rally since the debut of ChatGPT. Here were some of the biggest declines in the tech sector since the closing bell on Friday: Nvidia: -1.08% Palantir: -8.35% AMD: -2.42% Broadcom: -1.85% Meta: -1.89% Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon fanned valuation concerns when he speculated that the market could be heading toward a correction this week. "It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months," he said, speaking at the Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. "We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect," Ted Pick, the CEO of Morgan Stanley, also said at the event. The decline in Palantir stock on Tuesday marked a significant moment in the debate over valuations. The firm beat on earnings and revenue in the third quarter, reporting $1.18 billion in revenue for the last three-month period, ahead of the expected $1.09 billion. Despite the upbeat results and confident guidance, the stock tanked 8% after the report, as investors decided that after a blistering rally in 2025, the stock looked too rich. "All of a sudden, we are starting to see some Tech heavyweights fail to live up to investor expectations," David Rosenberg, the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a client note. "Even a company like Palantir has seen its share price hammered, even though its results did top expectations — nosebleed valuations got in the way." Meta stock has declined after the tech giant reported earnings and said it would double down on capex spending. Last week, the Facebook parent said it could spend $70 billion to $72 billion this year on AI capex, up from its prior guidance of $66 billion to $72 billion. It also said capex was expected to increase in 2026. Shares of Meta dropped as much as 14% on Thursday in a sign that investors are growing skeptical over the huge amounts of cash being thrown on AI. Its stock has continued to decline, trading 1.2% lower from Friday's close. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion on capex this year, according to Business Insider's latest analysis of company statements. "It's a yellow flag," Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, told BI of the sell-off in Meta. "If you don't get that best-case scenario, you're going to have pretty significant write-offs. Jump to

Title: Wall Street cheers bad news on jobs, sending stocks higher and betting that a soft labor market will force Powell’s hand in December

Stocks rose on Wall Street Wednesday as more U.S. companies turn in their latest quarterly reports and several economic updates shed some light on the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62 points, or 0.1%, as of 11:35 a.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.8%. The gains mark a reversal from the prior day’s dip as big technology stocks once again lead the broader market. Nvidia rose 1.6% and Google’s parent, Alphabet, jumped 2.4%. Their huge values give them outsized influence over the market. Several big industrial companies also helped lift the market. Companies from a broad spectrum of industries reported their latest financial results and gave updated forecasts. McDonald’s rose 2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.7% after beating Wall Street’s latest quarterly profit forecasts. On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 11.9% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting. Live Nation Entertainment fell 7.8% after its latest results fell short of analysts’ forecasts. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review. A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting. “The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other Fed officials have expressed concerns about more rate cuts, as inflation remains stubbornly high and could be fueled by lowering rates. The mix of a weaker job market and hot inflation leaves the Fed in a tough position. “For Fed watchers, this ADP report should make it clear that a December rate cut is now in play,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note to investors. “We are nearing stall speed in the labor market, and that will get the Fed’s attention.” Wall Street has tempered its expectations for another interest rate cut in December. Investors are now forecasting a 65% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 90% chance just prior to the previous rate cut. Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.15% from 4.09% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.62% from 3.58% late Tuesday. European markets gained ground and Asian markets closed mostly lower. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) fell after the drugmaker scaled back its outlook, citing disappointing demand for its GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs as competition in the sector increases. Novo Nordisk, the company behind Wegovy and Ozempic, posted third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of DK4.50 ($0.69), DK20 ($0.03) below the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Revenue was up 5.1% to DK74.98 billion ($11.53 billion), also short of forecasts. Novo Nordisk’s weaker results indicate mounting pressure in the weight-loss drug market that it once dominated. The maker of Ozempic and Wegovy is facing tougher competition, slower demand, and pricing pressures—and has now cut its full-year outlook for the fourth time in 2025. Wegovy sales rose 18% to DK20.35 billion ($3.13 billion), below expectations. Ozempic sales added 3% to DK30.74 billion ($4.73 billion), better than anticipated. The company now sees full-year operating profit growth of 4% to 7%, and sales of 8% to 11%. The previous outlook was for operating profit to gain 4% to 20% and sales to advance 8% to 14%. It said the change “reflects lowered growth expectations for Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 treatments within diabetes and obesity.” It's the fourth time the company narrowed its guidance this year. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk have lost about 46% of their value this year. The shares were recently off about 4%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.

The Galaxy XR headset launched just a few weeks ago in the US and South Korea with a $1,800 price tag. Samsung also launched a pair of controllers for its XR headset for an additional $250 or $175. However, shortly after the headset went live, these controllers were sold out due to high demand in the U.S. The good news is that the Korean OEM has been busy restocking the controllers for the past few days. Considering people who've added the item to their wishlist or clicked on the "Notify me" button on Samsung's website are receiving emails stating that the" Galaxy XR controllers are back in stock." The email further stated that "We have good news. An item you asked us to track is back in stock. Act fast, supplies are still limited." Samsung appears to be working on bringing back these popular controllers, but it seems like only select individuals in the U.S. have so far received restock notifications, while Samsung's official website still says these controllers are currently out of stock, with a "It’s not you. It’s us. We can’t make them fast enough." While Samsung has been clear that the Galaxy XR headset's sole purpose isn't just gaming, like the Meta Quest series. However, without these controllers, it would be tough to dive into more immersive VR games or PC-VR content, as these games simply won't work without them. The controllers are supposedly very ergonomic and are equipped with 6 DoF tracking technology and analog sticks, which deliver precise interactions in the 3D space for enhanced experiences. The Galaxy XR headset could be used for other things like mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or even entertainment. This is definitely a setback as users won't be able to experience the headset's other core functionality. For now, gaming enthusiasts have to wait it out and make do by operating the Galaxy XR with a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google’s collaborative software, as the company plays catch up.

Title: Wall Street holds steady as earnings reports flow in

By DAMIAN J. TROISE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks gained ground on Wall Street Wednesday following several upbeat economic updates and a steady flow of quarterly reports from U.S. companies. The gains were broad and marked a reversal from the prior day’s dip. Much of the market’s push and pull came from the technology sector, where several companies with huge values have an outsized influence over the market. Google’s parent, Alphabet, jumped 2.4%, Broadcom rose 2%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.4%. They helped lead the way higher for the broader market. Their gains also helped counter losses from a few technology behemoths, including Nvidia and Microsoft. Overall The S&P 500 rose 24.74 points, or 0.4% to 6,796.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 225.76 points, or 0.5%, to 47,311. The Nasdaq composite rose 151.16 points, or 0.6%, to 23,499.80. Company earnings and forecasts were once again a big focus for Wall Street, with results coming from a broad spectrum of industries. McDonald’s rose 2.2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.1% after beating Wall Street’s latest quarterly profit forecasts. On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 9.4% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting. Live Nation Entertainment fell 10.6% after its latest results fell short of analysts’ forecasts. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review. A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting. “The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make a wide range of loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which could stunt economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other Fed officials have expressed concerns about more rate cuts, as inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank’s target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 3% in September. The mix of a weaker job market and hot inflation leaves the Fed in a tough position. “For Fed watchers, this ADP report should make it clear that a December rate cut is now in play,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note to investors. “We are nearing stall speed in the labor market, and that will get the Fed’s attention.” Wall Street has tempered its expectations for another interest rate cut in December. Investors are now forecasting a 63% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates, according to CME FedWatch. That’s down from a 90% chance just prior to the previous rate cut. The threat of tariffs also continues to hang over consumers and businesses. President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, Canada and many other nations has been unpredictable. The full impact of higher prices is difficult to forecast because of constant shifts in policy. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about the legality of the sweeping tariffs. Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.16% from 4.09% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.63% from 3.58% late Tuesday. European markets gained ground and Asian markets closed mostly lower.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Bet_Noire / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trading modestly higher as we reach the midpoint of the trading week, following a risk-off day on Tuesday that saw all major indices decline. The NASDAQ led the sell-off, closing over 2% lower, sparked by a dramatic drop in Palantir, despite the company posting results and guidance that beat expectations. When the closing bell finally rang, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had clawed back some of their losses, closing at 6771 and 47,085, respectively, while the NASDAQ closed at 23,348. Big Short author Michael Burry tossed some gas on the Tuesday dumpster fire by announcing that he was long puts on Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). Market pundits cited continued concerns about AI valuation as the reason for the selling. Still, after multiple top Wall Street bankers, such as David Solomon and Jamie Dimon, have warned, the market is likely ahead of itself following a three-year rally. The “Buy the Dip” crowd tried to boost the market early in the day, but was met with even more selling by the close. As would be expected, yields across the Treasury curve plunged as investors and traders rushed to the safe-haven security of U.S. government debt. The benchmark 10-year bond closed the day at 4.0% while the 30-year long bond was last seen at 4.67%. One thing is for sure: with job openings shrinking to the lowest level since 2021, expectations for a December rate cut may grab a tailwind this week. Numerous Fed Governors have maintained that the current rate is too restrictive, and the job data, combined with other economic news, may soon prove them correct. Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate both finished the day lower, as the ripple effect from the equity market sell-off, along with some chatter that the Russian sanctions may not be as severe as initially thought by traders, contributed to the decline. The big winner again was the Natural Gas complex, where spot prices finished the day up 1.15% at $4.31. We have maintained for some time at 24/7 Wall St. that the energy trade for the rest of 2025 and 2026 may very well be in the Natural Gas complex, as power demands for Data Centers driving AI cloud computing may fall into the laps of the top companies in that sector. Spot gold was another victim of the sell-off. While bullion is regarded as one of the ultimate safe havens, the massive rally over the last couple of years has likely prompted many hedge funds to take profits, especially as we are less than two months from the end of the trading year. The final print for Gold on Tuesday came in at $3930, down 1.76%. It’s worth noting that Gold was trading at $4375 just two weeks ago. Silver followed suit, closing down over 2% at $47.04. The heavy selling of the cryptocurrency leaders remains one of the big stories across Wall Street, as Bitcoin fell 5% to trade below the $100,000 level for the first time since June. The spot price, reported late Tuesday, was $99,584. Ethereum suffered a similar fate, finishing the day down almost 13%, and was seen late Tuesday at $ 3,137. Wall Street analysts cited the broad “risk-off” sentiment among investors driven by macroeconomic concerns, lowered expectations for a December Federal Reserve interest rate cut, and massive selling pressure from large long-term holders. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Title: Wall Street execs say the AI stocks dominating the market will soon be split into winners and losers

Brands had a great day on Tuesday as the rest of the market tumbled, soaring 7% after saying it might offload Pizza Hut. Addition by subtraction! Rundown But first, it's time to separate the haves from have-nots. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings Stock valuations — seen by many as flying too close to the sun — took a hit on Tuesday after a chorus of bank execs spoke up to throw their weight behind that view. Chief among them were Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. Major indexes ended the day firmly in the red, led lower by the same AI-affiliated tech names largely responsible for recent records. While jarring, this commentary was hardly surprising. The execs were simply pointing out an age-old market truism: sometimes stocks have to go down and reset before continuing their ascent. Instead, the most interesting takeaway came from what Pick said about 2026, namely that there will be more dispersion. In simpler terms, the Morgan Stanley chief is saying investors will eventually start separating the wheat from the chaff. Higher-quality companies with strong balance sheets and superior financials will reign supreme, leaving the have-nots in the dust. A sign of how this could play out in AI happened last week, when Meta's stock price took it on the chin after the company pledged to boost capex spending beyond already-lofty levels in 2026. Compare that to the relatively mild reaction in Microsoft shares, despite them saying basically the same thing. Amazon is still pouring money into AI as well, and its stock was up double digits on earnings. A main reason? Meta is far less diversified than its AI-focused peers. It doesn't have a legacy cash-cow business like software or cloud computing to insulate it from the twists and turns of the AI trade. Simply put, the companies with the most air-tight financial situations outperform when things get chaotic. Look at the dot-com bubble for a more extreme example. Countless companies went belly-up, unable to deliver on the market's valuation hype. But an elite group of high-quality companies stayed the course and emerged from the wreckage: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel, just to name a handful. That's dispersion in action. So how can you play the theme in your own portfolio? Lisa Shalett, CIO of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, recently made some recommendations for quality-seeking investors wary of market bifurcation: Speculative booms are all fun and games until they're suddenly not. Making these shifts can help you proactively play defense against a valuation-driven reckoning. Bitcoin has tumbled from all-time highs reached in early October, falling as much as 20% from its peak to below $100,000 on Tuesday. It was the first time since June that the formerly red-hot crypto fell beneath the six-figure threshold. The drop can be attributed to two main things. First, there was a historic unwinding of bitcoin long positions on Oct. 10 that saw investors liquidate $19 billion across exchanges in less than 24 hours. That was an inflection point of sorts. Second, it's suffered from an overall risk-off move that was also seen in stocks on Tuesday. Bitcoin has traded as a risk asset for months, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's non-committal approach to a December rate cut has spooked investors. This chart puts the valuation worries outlined above in context. As megacap stocks have made up a growing percentage of the S&P 500, their sales have not kept pace. In the name of preparing for increased market dispersion, it might be a good idea for investors to identify which companies have actually seen revenue keep rising alongside their share prices. This is exactly the type of high-quality attribute Morgan Stanley has recommended traders rotate into. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. If there's one piece of clothing that's become synonymous with the finance industry, it's the vest. Stroll around Manhattan at lunchtime on any given weekday, and you'll see swarms of sleeveless coats in all their glory. Their ubiquity earned a nickname years ago: the Midtown uniform. It's become an internet meme, the first item in a finance bro starter pack, and eyeroll fodder for hipsters who dislike all things basic. So, with the vest way past the peak of its hype cycle, why are they still such a staple on Wall Street? I hit the streets to find out. One common reason I heard is that bankers simply like to flex — not necessarily their visible arms, but where they work — as many firms give out branded vests. "It's an earned status thing. You put in a lot of work to get to equity research for your team, to get to the PM role for a team, to be able to get to that said firm," one analyst told me. "That's why you wear it." There's also an element of fitting in. Wearing a vest is a shorthand signal that you're part of the club. That's why people even wear them in the office, out of the elements, said Jonathan Grossman, who is two years into working at UBS. "They want to look cool," he said. "They want to look part of the act." Those in finance-adjacent industries like commercial real estate have also started wearing vests. Despite its casual nature, a vest lends you a degree of credibility with financial industry clients, said Laz Rabanales, who works at Okada & Company. "I'm not a banker, I'm a commercial real-estate agent, and I kind of want to appeal to that industry," Rabanales said. "When you're dressed as that person, then they'll most likely want to talk with you and work with you." But there's not always a deeper meaning. As one banker succinctly explained: "It's cold out." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

WFTV Now NEW YORK — Stocks gained ground on Wall Street Wednesday following several upbeat economic updates and a steady flow of quarterly reports from U.S. companies. The gains were broad and marked a reversal from the prior day's dip. Much of the market's push and pull came from the technology sector, where several companies with huge values have an outsized influence over the market. Google’s parent, Alphabet, jumped 2.4%, Broadcom rose 2%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.4%. They helped lead the way higher for the broader market. Their gains also helped counter losses from a few technology behemoths, including Nvidia and Microsoft. Overall The S&P 500 rose 24.74 points, or 0.4% to 6,796.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 225.76 points, or 0.5%, to 47,311. The Nasdaq composite rose 151.16 points, or 0.6%, to 23,499.80. Company earnings and forecasts were once again a big focus for Wall Street, with results coming from a broad spectrum of industries. McDonald's rose 2.2% after reporting that its sales benefited from the return of its popular Snack Wraps in the third quarter. International Flavors & Fragrances jumped 4.1% after beating Wall Street's latest quarterly profit forecasts. On the losing side, Taser maker Axon Enterprise slumped 9.4% after forecasting weaker profits than analysts were expecting. Live Nation Entertainment fell 10.6% after its latest results fell short of analysts' forecasts. The latest round of earnings offers Wall Street a source of information on consumers, businesses and the economy that is otherwise lacking amid the government shutdown. Important monthly updates on inflation and employment have ceased, leaving investors, economists and the Federal Reserve without a fuller picture of the economy. There are still several informative private economic updates that Wall Street can review. A monthly report from ADP showed that private payrolls rose more than expected in October. The report offers a partial glimpse into the job market, which has been generally weakening and raising broader concerns about economic growth. The services sector, which is the largest part of the U.S. economy, expanded in October more than Wall Street expected, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report shows that while overall business activity grew, employment was still contracting. “The survey provides a reassuring sign that economic growth persisted in October despite the government shutdown,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, wrote in a note to investors. A weaker job market remains a big concern for the Fed. The central bank cut its benchmark rate for the second time this year at its most recent meeting, in part to help bolster the economy amid a weakening job market. Lower interest rates can make a wide range of loans and credit less expensive, potentially promoting economic growth. But, lower rates can also add fuel to inflation, which could stunt economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and several other Fed officials have expressed concerns about more rate cuts, as inflation remains stubbornly above the central bank's target of 2%. Consumer prices rose 3% in September. The mix of a weaker job market and hot inflation leaves the Fed in a tough position. “For Fed watchers, this ADP report should make it clear that a December rate cut is now in play,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, in a note to investors. “We are nearing stall speed in the labor market, and that will get the Fed’s attention.” Wall Street has tempered its expectations for another interest rate cut in December. Investors are now forecasting a 63% chance that the Fed will cut interest rates, according to CME FedWatch. That's down from a 90% chance just prior to the previous rate cut. The threat of tariffs also continues to hang over consumers and businesses. President Donald Trump's trade war with China, Canada and many other nations has been unpredictable. The full impact of higher prices is difficult to forecast because of constant shifts in policy. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday about the legality of the sweeping tariffs. Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.16% from 4.09% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 3.63% from 3.58% late Tuesday. European markets gained ground and Asian markets closed mostly lower. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: AMD stock crashes despite strong Q3 results: why is AMD stock down today, and could AMD’s rack-scale AI breakthrough spark a massive 2026 comeback?

AMD stock crashed 3.7% to $250.05 despite posting record Q3 2025 earnings. The chipmaker reported $9.25 billion in revenue, up 36% year-over-year, and $1.20 EPS, beating forecasts. Strong AI chip demand and new deals with OpenAI and Oracle pushed data center revenue to $4.3 billion. Yet, investors booked profits after massive gains this year. AMD’s $406 billion market cap and high 150.63 P/E ratio reflect steep valuation worries. Analysts still see rack-scale AI systems as AMD’s 2026 growth catalyst.

Title: Optimizing nested JSON array processing using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/optimizing-nested-json-array-processing-using-aws-step-functions-distributed-map/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T23:12:17Z

AWS Blogs When you’re working with large datasets, you’ve likely encountered the challenge of processing complex JSON structures in your automated workflows. You need to preprocess arrays within nested JSON objects before you can run parallel processing on them. Extracting data used to require custom code and extra processing steps, delaying you from building your core application logic. With AWS Step Functions Distributed Map, you can process large datasets with concurrent iterations of workflow steps across data entries. Using the enhanced ItemsPointer feature of Distributed Maps, you can extract array data directly from JSON objects stored in Amazon S3. Alternatively, for JSON object as state input, you can use Items (JSONata) or ItemsPath (JSONPath). With this enhancement you can point directly to arrays nested within JSON structures, eliminating the need for custom preprocessing of your data. With ItemsPointer, Items, and ItemsPath you can select the nested array data and simplify your workflows. In this post, we explore how to optimize processing array data embedded within complex JSON structures using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map. You’ll learn how to use ItemsPointer to reduce the complexity of your state machine definitions, create more flexible workflow designs, and streamline your data processing pipelines—all without writing additional transformation code or AWS Lambda functions. In this e-commerce use case example, you’ll build a sample application that demonstrates processing of product inventory data for an e-commerce application using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map. The application receives a JSON file from an upstream application containing an array of product information. The Step Functions workflow reads the JSON file containing product data from an S3 bucket and iterates over the array to enrich each product data in the array. The following diagram presents the AWS Step Functions state machine. JSON array processing workflow The JSON array is processed using the following workflow: MaxConcurrency can be configured to specify the number of child workflow executions in a Distributed Map that can run in parallel. If not specified, then Step Functions doesn’t limit concurrency and runs 10,000 parallel child workflow executions. You can read a JSON file from a S3 bucket using ItemReader and its sub-fields. If the JSON file, from the S3 bucket, contains a nested object structure, you can select the specific node with your data set with an ItemsPointer. For example, the following input JSON file: The following JSONata-based workflow configuration extracts a nested list of products from productUpdates/items: For JSONPath-based workflow note that Arguments is replaced with Parameters: The ItemReader field is not needed when your dataset is JSON data from a previous step. ItemsPointer is only applicable when the input JSON objects read from an S3 bucket. If you are using JSON as state input to a Distributed Map, then you can use the ItemsPath (for JSONPath) or Items (for JSONata) field to specify a location in the input that points to JSON array or object used for iterations. To use Step Functions Distributed Map, verify you have: Run the following steps to deploy the Step Functions state machine. Enter the following details: The outputs from the sam deploy will be used in the subsequent steps. The state machine reads the input product-updates.json file and invokes a Lambda function to update the database for every product in the array after adding price and stock information. The execution metadata is also uploaded into the results bucket. Run the following steps to monitor and verify the test results. Wait until the status shows SUCCEEDED. To avoid costs, remove all resources you’ve created while following along with this post. Run the following command after replacing the <placeholder> variable to delete the resources you deployed for this post’s solution: In this post, you learned how to use Step Functions Distributed Map for extracting array data natively from JSON objects stored in a S3 bucket. By removing custom data extraction code, you can simplify the processing of your large-scale parallel workloads. With ItemsPointer you can extract array data within JSON files stored in a S3 bucket , and with Items(JSONata) or ItemsPath (JSONPath), you can extract arrays from complex JSON state input, adding flexibility to your workflow designs. New input sources for Distributed Map are available in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Step Functions is available. For a complete list of AWS Regions where Step Functions is available, see the AWS Region Table. To get started, you can use the Distributed Map mode today in the AWS Step Functions console.

As launch costs plummet, a record wave of issuers — independent traders, hedge-fund holdouts, mutual-fund refugees — is testing whether conviction and capital are enough to crack BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street's dominance. November 4, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Sofia Massie left her job at Jane Street in January with one thing: an idea for an ETF that would mirror the US stock market but quietly hold onto dividends, wringing out a tax advantage many investors never see. She didn’t have a team. Or a brand. Or the institutional heft that usually comes with a Wall Street-backed launch. What she did have was about $300,000 — and a white-label firm to handle the mechanics. Eight months later, the LionShares US Equity Total Return ETF (TOT) went live. Massie’s fund is one of dozens now reshaping the $13 trillion ETF industry. As launch costs plummet, a record wave of issuers — independent traders, hedge-fund holdouts, mutual-fund refugees — is testing whether conviction and capital are enough. The dominance of the industry’s big three players is starting to crack: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and State Street Investment Management drew just 57% of investor flows this year, their lowest share on record. But as the flood of new funds accelerates, so does the race for shelf space, relevance — and survival. “Launching an ETF is very easy for anyone who has the money to do it,” Massie, 25, said. “The main challenge I had was keeping the cost low and starting the fund as a one-woman team.” Related:AUM Thresholds, Limited Track Records Dampen B/D Appetites for New ETFs The past two years — during which ETFs attracted more than $2 trillion in investor cash — have seen 60 new issuers enter the ETF market, the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. More firms have launched ETFs since 2020 than in the entire period dating back to the debut of the first exchange-traded fund in 1993. And it’s not just emerging players that are being drawn to the field. Big-name hedge funds like Man Group Plc, storied European asset managers like Pictet Group and old-school mutual fund managers like Baron Capital are diving in. All are racing to capture a share of the trillions of dollars that have poured into the market in recent years. Industry watchers say the list of firms yet to jump in is set to grow thanks to fresh regulatory breakthroughs, including the potential approval of ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, and expedited listings for commodity-based products, including crypto-linked ETFs. “The ETF footprint is only set to keep expanding,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s increasingly self-evident that the ETF is a better wrapper. Asset managers that fail to embrace it risk being left behind as the industry evolves.” Demand for easy-to-trade vehicles keeps climbing. ETFs now make up 36% of all US fund assets, double their share from a decade ago, BI data show. Still, just one in three of the more than 600 US asset managers BI tracks offer them, meaning that plenty could still enter the arena. Related:Schwab: Majority of Retail Investors Plan to Up ETF Allocations For many, working with a white-label issuer streamlines the process. The firms can take care of various back-end work, including filing for funds and working out sales and distribution plans. “The barriers to entry in the ETF space have come down dramatically — what used to take years and millions of dollars can now be done in months for a fraction of that cost,” Gavin Filmore, chief revenue officer at Tidal Financial Group, said. “The real challenge today is differentiation and distribution.” Tidal, a full-stack white-label ETF platform, now oversees more than $50 billion in assets, having rolled out some 138 funds this year — a 52% jump from 2024 and more than twice as many as two years ago. ETF launch costs vary by complexity, strategy and structure, but Filmore estimates around $65,000 is needed to set up a fund and about $225,000 in annual operating expenses. That’s down approximately 20% from a decade ago. As competition has heated up — ETF launches have tripled since 2021 — closures have also surged. This year, roughly one ETF has shut down for every five that have debuted, data compiled by Bloomberg show. With more than 4,500 funds now in existence, keeping an ETF alive has become tougher, as oversaturation makes it harder to attract and retain enough assets to remain cost-efficient and liquid.Two months after launch, Massie’s handed off the day-to-day mechanics — fund accounting and custody — to a network of specialist service providers. Her fund has $6.5 million in assets.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Millions except per share amounts and percentages) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Millions) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(Millions) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.SELECTED CORPORATE DATA(Millions) (Unaudited) (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments.The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers.The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services.The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at (recovery from) contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at (recovery from) contract manufacturer, loss contingency on legal matter, and income from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

Title: Uber Shares Fall 9% Despite Reporting Strong Q3 Earnings

Time Published: 2025-11-04T15:48:18Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Sundry Photography / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) delivered a massive earnings beat this morning, but the stock is selling off in premarket trading anyway. That’s the tension worth watching right now. Uber reported Q3 earnings this morning with EPS of $1.20, crushing the $0.70 consensus estimate. Revenue came in at $13.47 billion, missing expectations of $13.54 billion by $70 million. The stock declined 9% in premarket trading to $92.25, suggesting investors are focusing more on the revenue shortfall and guidance implications than the headline EPS surprise. Trips and Bookings Drive the Momentum The real story here is operational velocity. Gross bookings reached $49.74 billion, up 21% year over year. Trips increased 22% YoY, marking what CEO Dara Khosrowshahi called “one of the largest trip-volume increases in the company’s history.” Monthly active platform consumers grew 17% YoY, indicating consistent user expansion across the platform. Both segments showed strength. Mobility revenue hit $7.68 billion, up 20%, while Delivery revenue jumped to $4.48 billion, up 29%. Adjusted EBITDA expanded 33% YoY to $2.26 billion. Free cash flow reached $2.23 billion, a signal that profitability is translating into real cash generation, not just accounting improvements. The $70 million revenue miss is modest in absolute terms but meaningful in context. With gross bookings accelerating and trips surging, you’d expect revenue to track higher. The gap suggests either mix headwinds (lower-margin business growing faster) or pricing pressure in core markets. I’d keep an eye on this during the earnings call. What’s not in doubt is margin expansion. Operating income hit $1.11 billion, and net income reached $6.63 billion. That includes a $4.9 billion tax valuation release benefit, so strip that out and the underlying profitability picture is still strong. EPS: $1.20 (vs. $0.70 expected)Revenue: $13.47B (vs. $13.54B expected); miss by $70MGross Bookings: $49.74B (vs. implied ~$48.7B); up 21% YoYAdjusted EBITDA: $2.26B (up 33% YoY)Free Cash Flow: $2.23BTrips: Up 22% YoYMonthly Active Platform Consumers: Up 17% YoY The adjusted EBITDA growth outpacing revenue growth shows operational leverage kicking in. That’s the metric that justifies the current valuation multiple. For Q4 2025, management guided for gross bookings of $52.25 billion to $53.75 billion, representing 17% to 21% YoY growth on constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2.41 billion to $2.51 billion implies 31% to 36% YoY growth. The company also noted a 1 percentage point currency tailwind expected to boost Q4 growth. The guidance range suggests confidence, though the revenue miss today tempers enthusiasm slightly. Khosrowshahi’s commentary leaned bullish, emphasizing investments in “lifelong customer relationships,” local commerce expansion, and AI and autonomous vehicle potential. The tone was optimistic but not reckless. You’ll want to listen for clarity on the revenue miss. Was it mix shift, pricing pressure, or timing? Also watch for any commentary on competitive dynamics in core markets and how the company plans to sustain delivery growth, which is now outpacing mobility on a percentage basis. The path to $108.88 (current analyst price target) depends on whether margin expansion continues without sacrificing volume.

Title: Denny's to go private in $620 million deal for the 72-year-old breakfast chain

Watch CBS News Updated on: November 4, 2025 / 10:59 AM EST / CBS/AP Denny's, the breakfast chain known for classic diner food and its Grand Slam Breakfast, is going private in a $620 million deal orchestrated by a group of investors. The deal, announced Monday, values the chain at $620 million, including debt. The investors purchasing the company are private equity investment company TriArtisan Capital Advisors, investment firm Treville Capital and Denny's franchisee Yadav Enterprises. Under the agreement, Denny's shareholders will receive $6.25 per share in cash for each share of Denny's common stock they own, or a total of $322 million. That represents a 52% premium to Denny's closing stock price on Monday. Denny's shares jumped $2.05, or 50%, to $6.17 in early Tuesday trading. Founded in 1953 as Danny's Donuts, the company changed its name to Denny's in 1959 to avoid confusion with another chain, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange a decade later. During the past two years, Denny's has struggled to boost sales as consumers shifted toward a reliance on delivery through apps like Uber Eats, while newer rivals such as First Watch offered healthier breakfast menus. Private equity firm TriArtisan owns restaurant chains P.F. Chang's and TGI Friday's, while Yadav Enterprises owns more than 310 franchise restaurants, including Denny's, TGI Friday's and Jack in the Box. Treville Capital is an investment firm whose chairman is Michael Ovitz, the co-founder of Creative Artists Agency and former president of the Walt Disney Co. Denny's reached out to more than 40 potential buyers and received multiple offers, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade said in a statement. Valade said Denny's board believed the deal announced Monday was in the best interest of shareholders and the best path forward for the company. "Denny's is an iconic piece of the American dream, with a renowned brand, a strong franchise base and loyal customers," said Rohit Manocha, co-founder at TriArtisan, in the statement. Last fall, Denny's said it planned to close 150 of its lowest-performing locations. At the end of the second quarter, Denny's had 1,558 restaurants worldwide, including 1,422 Denny's restaurants and 74 Keke's restaurants. Denny's acquired the Keke's brand in 2022. If approved by Denny's shareholders, the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © LALAKA / Shutterstock.com After testing all-time highs, the major indices are in the red this morning. Dow futures are down 301 points. Nasdaq futures are down 344, as the S&P 500 sinks about 70 points. All thanks to a decline in Palantir’s overvalued shares, despite the company beating earnings estimates and offering solid guidance. There are also concerns about the stretched valuations of other key AI stocks and their ability to boost profits to justify numbers. Still, analysts are out with new upgrades. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO): Analysts at Jefferies reiterated a buy rating on AVGO and named it as a top pick. The firm also raised its price target to $480 from $415. As noted by the analysts, “While NVDA remains the leader and we still see upside there, AVGO has a greater magnitude of estimate upside as Google, Meta, and OAI ASICs ramp,” as quoted by CNBC. “Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO, but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27.” Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Loop Capital reiterated its buy rating on the tech giant and hiked its price target to $350 from $250. The firm believes NVDA can double its GPU shipments over the next year to 15 months to 2.1 million by the January 2026 quarter. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $240 from $210 ahead of earnings, as well. The firm believes investor expectations have increased heading into NVDA earnings, thanks to multiple AI infrastructure announcements. The firm also believes NVDA will provide a beat and raise quarter. Helping, Nvidia is up on news that Microsoft secured export licenses from the Trump Administration to ship NVDA chips to the United Arab Emirates. CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV): Analysts at Citi reiterated a buy rating on CRWV ahead of earnings, with a price target of $192 from $164. The firm pointed to rising AI demand as a CRWV tailwind. “In the near term, we see CRWV as one of the larger AI beneficiaries across our coverage. With recent deals signed with NVDA, META, and an OpenAI expansion, we estimate ~85% QoQ backlog growth,” they said, as quoted by CNBC. “As Blackwell + customer ramps come online in 4Q, we expect a revenue reacceleration into year-end and outsized (~$100M+) revenue beats.” Latest Podcast Episode OpenAI Signs Two Massive Deals and Two New Portfolio Buys 51 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Live Nov 4, 2025 Live Oct 30, 2025 The broad markets are mixed to kick off trading today.

November 04, 2025 09:31 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 4 November 2025 – On 30 October 2025, Novo Nordisk announced the submission of an unsolicited proposal to acquire Metsera, Inc. (Metsera)1. Today, Novo Nordisk confirms that it has submitted an updated, unsolicited proposal to acquire Metsera. The updated proposal has been declared superior by Metsera’s board of directors. The acquisition of Metsera, including its early and development-stage incretin and non-incretin analogue peptide programmes, would provide Novo Nordisk the opportunity to maximise the potential of Metsera’s complementary portfolio and capabilities. An acquisition would be in line with Novo Nordisk’s long-term strategy of developing innovative and differentiated medicines and treating millions more people living with obesity and diabetes and their associated comorbidities. About the updated proposal Under the terms of the proposal, Novo Nordisk would acquire all outstanding shares of Metsera’s common stock at a price of 62.20 USD per share in cash (equal to an approximate aggregated equity value of 7.2 billion USD or approximate enterprise value of 6.7 billion USD) and contingent value rights (CVRs) for up to 24.00 USD per share in cash (or an approximate aggregated value of up to 2.8 billion USD) based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. The cash consideration will be paid at signing in exchange for non-voting preferred stock representing 50% of Metsera’s share capital and the CVRs will be issued upon the closing of the acquisition in exchange for the remaining shares. Novo Nordisk believes that the proposal, including the structure of the transaction, complies with all applicable laws and is in the best interest of patients who will benefit from our commitment to innovation, as well as Metsera’s shareholders.

Title: Wall Street's Biggest IREN Bull Hiked Price Target to $142 After $9.7B Microsoft AI Deal

Wall Street continues to try and stay ahead of the hot-handed IREN (IREN) after yesterday's $9.7 billion agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to supply 200 megawatts (MW) of AI data center capacity. The company's biggest sell-side fan is Cantor Fitzgerald's Brett Knoblauch. Bullish on the stock this past summer when it was trading for $10 and continually hiking his price target since, Knoblauch yesterday raised again, this time to $142 from $100. That implies more than a 100% upside from yesterday's close of $67.75. Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani, meanwhile, said the deal with MSFT cements IREN's position as one of the few infrastructure players owning its own power assets. He hiked his IREN price target to $125 from $75 and reiterated its outperform rating. The pact could generate $2 billion in annual recurring AI cloud revenue for IREN by 2027, on top of roughly $500 million from existing operations, Chhugani said. Unlike competitors such as CoreWeave (CRWV) and Nebius (NBIS), IREN’s 2.9 gigawatt (GW) portfolio allows it to expand in line with demand without relying on co-location partners, a structure which will boost profitability, Chhugani continued. Chhugani now forecasts $2.5 billion in AI cloud revenue by 2027, up from $1.1 billion previously, and values IREN’s Sweetwater site at $5 million per megawatt, based on recent M&A multiples. Further, the Microsoft deal taps only about 10% of IREN’s total power capacity across British Columbia and Texas, leaving scope to scale further with Microsoft or other hyperscalers. Roth Capital has also lifted its price target to $94 from $82. Shares are lower by nearly 5% early Tuesday alongside a general swoon in markets, with Nasdaq futures down 1.5% and bitcoin threatening to tumble below $100,000 level.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Adobe (ADBE) stock should be added to your watch list. Here’s why – it is presently trading within the support range ($320.60 – $354.34), levels where it has previously experienced notable rebounds. Over the past decade, Adobe stock attracted buying interest at this level 7 times and subsequently achieved an average peak return of 40.2%. The stock has been beaten down, falling close to 23% year-to-date, due to intensifying competition from AI-powered creative tools and investor concerns about Adobe’s high subscription fees amid rising alternatives. However, is the price movement sufficient by itself? Fundamental analysis is also essential. For ADBE Read Buy or Sell ADBE Stock to evaluate the strength of this buying opportunity. No matter how good Adobe looks, holding a single stock carries significant risk. See how Trefis High Quality Portfolio reduces that risk and gives you upside exposure.

Title: OpenAI’s $1T IPO: a Split from Nvidia’s Costly AI Dominance?

Our goal is to help readers make informed decisions. Read more. Key Takeaways OpenAI is reportedly preparing for a landmark initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, making it one of the largest IPOs in history. The filing could come as early as the second half of 2026, with a potential listing by 2027, as OpenAI looks to expand beyond its private funding base and tap public markets for growth capital. The move follows a corporate restructuring that established the nonprofit OpenAI Foundation and reduced Microsoft’s ownership to around 27%, giving Sam Altman’s company greater strategic and operational independence. This IPO represents more than just a record-breaking valuation; it marks the beginning of OpenAI’s next phase of industrial growth. With rising compute demands and a heavy reliance on Nvidia’s hardware, the company is seeking record amounts of new capital to build its own energy-efficient infrastructure and diversify its chip supply chain. As OpenAI prepares for its public listing, the company is also redefining its financial and business structure to support the next phase of growth. Its restructuring and forthcoming IPO represent the foundation of a long-term strategy: to create the resources, autonomy, and scale needed to lead the next era of intelligent computing in a way that makes sense for investors. In essence, OpenAI’s potential $1 trillion IPO isn’t just about valuation: it’s about taking the steps to make it more market-friendly, enabling the kind of financial scaling that makes sense for a new entrant to the Mag 7, one who wants to dictate the future of artificial intelligence. In recent weeks, OpenAI completed a sweeping corporate restructuring that established the OpenAI Foundation, a nonprofit entity designed to anchor the company’s mission around the safe and ethical development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The Foundation now holds a 26% equity stake in the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC, a public benefit corporation structured to balance two often competing forces, namely mission oversight and capital flexibility. At the same time, Microsoft’s ownership has been reduced to around 27%, signaling OpenAI’s clear intent to lessen its dependence on a single strategic partner and broaden its governance base. This new hybrid corporate structure provides OpenAI with the flexibility to raise capital from public markets while maintaining its nonprofit influence at the board level. This change invites a key question: how will OpenAI reconcile the commercial pressures of a trillion-dollar enterprise with its foundational commitment to developing AGI safely and responsibly? CEO Sam Altman’s vision for OpenAI will require massive investment, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars, to expand compute capacity and secure reliable renewable energy sources. Looking ahead, OpenAI may also develop its own custom AI chips to reduce dependence on suppliers like Nvidia and strengthen control over its hardware stack. It’s an ambitious step, but one that could be essential to sustaining the race toward AGI. An IPO would provide OpenAI with the capital it needs to accelerate its long-term vision, while also rewarding major early backers, including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. With revenues projected to reach $20 billion but losses climbing due to the soaring cost of Nvidia hardware, going public is both a strategic necessity and a natural next step. Ultimately, OpenAI aims to build a vertically integrated AI economy—one that unites chips, compute, and energy into a self-sustaining industrial ecosystem capable of powering the next era of intelligent technology. As the IPO comes into view, one of the clearest signals from OpenAI’s next phase is a push to escape the cost and energy bottlenecks tied to its current hardware platform. The strategy centers on both reducing dependency on Nvidia’s GPU monopoly (and its rising costs), as well as improving efficiency in infrastructure built for AGI-scale demands. Nvidia’s GPUs remain the backbone of most AI training operations, including those of OpenAI. However, these GPUs come with steep costs and fast-growing energy demands. Supply-chain tightness and per-unit price increases have amplified these operating expenses, while US power grids strain under the scale of these large AI training clusters. Chinese competitors, such as DeepSeek, appear to be outpacing Nvidia’s GPUs in terms of energy efficiency. This highlights a strategic gap, and if OpenAI wants to scale successfully, it needs to address this gap. In fact, there are reports that the company is already buying up all the RAM it can, some saying it accounts for 40% of the global DRAM demand. Since supply can’t possibly keep up, this has had an unfortunate effect of pushing prices to historical highs: anyone looking to buy RAM right now will have to reckon with a 171% year-on-year increase in the price tag. This October, OpenAI entered into a multi-gigawatt deal with AMD (Instinct MI450 and future generations), on track for a 1 GW deployment in the second half of 2026, and up to 6 GW over time. At the same time, the company is exploring Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and other accelerator platforms to further diversify its compute stack – and, ideally, optimize its energy costs. The shift toward a more varied compute ecosystem could increase OpenAI’s GFLOPS per watt, while reducing its cost per watt and mitigating its supplier risk. Overall, it could position OpenAI as a more resilient infrastructure player, not just an LLM model operator. OpenAI’s IPO may be the culmination of one wave – and the spark of the next. As infrastructure, software, and energy converge, companies moving into publicly traded markets could redefine how investors access the growing AI narrative. AI stocks are surging – and have been for much of the last two years. Nvidia recently reached a whopping $5T market capitalization: a historic milestone not just in the tech sector, but for any company. And it doesn’t look like the growth’s going to stop there. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang claimed the company is looking at a $500B worth of AI chip orders in 2026, which sparked number of analysts to claim that this kind revenue would mean the stock still has a lot of upside to it. CoreWeave, an AI-infrastructure provider, has seen its share prices rise rapidly since its IPO in March, currently trading at $126 – over three times its price at launch. If OpenAI’s IPO unfolds smoothly, it could ignite the next wave of AI investment, positioning the company as the software counterpart to Nvidia’s hardware dominance. Together, they would represent a kind of “completion” of the AI ecosystem that investors have long been anticipating. OpenAI’s public debut would likely act as a catalyst for competition among chipmakers, cloud providers, and energy firms, all racing to deliver the lowest cost per watt for AGI-scale compute. This global reshuffling echoes broader geopolitical dynamics, as nations like Saudi Arabia pursue ambitious AI strategies positioned between U.S. and Chinese interests, leveraging their energy resources to become major players in the next era of artificial intelligence. The core of the AI space may see a shift away from Nvidia – today’s GPU supply’s dominant force – and toward vertically integrated ecosystem players with hardware, compute, and energy in-house. At the very least, that’s what OpenAI envisions. OpenAI’s potential $1 trillion IPO could mark a defining moment in its evolution, from a research pioneer to one of the most successful SaaS, and finally a full-scale industrial powerhouse. Yet the move raises a critical question: can a publicly traded company truly uphold its mission of “safe AGI” when market expectations demand relentless growth? The debate over ethical AI is intensifying across industries, from corporations pursuing AGI to governments deploying AI for surveillance, as seen in ICE’s use of AI to monitor social media activity. As OpenAI channels public capital into more efficient hardware and energy systems, it faces the complex challenge of balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. If successful, the company could not only lessen its dependence on Nvidia but also redefine what true AI leadership means, measured not just by model intelligence but by efficiency, autonomy, and the ability to balance moral restraint with profit.

Title: Tylenol to join Kleenex, Huggies and Listerine in $48.7 billion takeover deal between Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/04/tylenol-takeover-kimberly-clark-kenvue-48-7-billion/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T11:47:11Z
Full Content:
Kimberly-Clark is buying Tylenol maker Kenvue in a cash and stock deal worth about $48.7 billion, creating a massive consumer health goods company. Shareholders of Kimberly-Clark will own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46% in what is one of the largest corporate takeovers this year. The deal must still be approved by the shareholders of both companies. The combined company will have a huge stable of household brands under one roof, putting Kenvue’s Listerine mouthwash and Band-Aid side-by-side with Kimberly-Clark’s Cottonelle toilet paper, Huggies and Kleenex tissues. It will also generate about $32 billion in annual revenue. Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its slow-growth consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. Kenvue has since been targeted by activist investors unhappy about the trajectory of the company and Wall Street appeared to anticipate some heavy lifting ahead for Kimberly-Clark. Kenvue’s stock jumped 12% Monday afternoon, while shares of Kimberly-Clark, based outside of Dallas, slumped by nearly 15%. Kenvue shares have shed nearly 50% of their value since approaching $28 in the spring of 2023. Morningstar analyst Keonhee Kim said Kenvue’s volatile journey as a public company may have been driven in part by poor execution and a lack of experience operating as a stand-alone business. He said the leadership of a more-established consumer products company like Kimberly-Clark could help unlock some of Kenvue’s value. He also noted that Kenvue brands include Neutrogena, Benadryl and other names that have been in store consumer health aisles for decades. Kim said he thinks Kimberly-Clark may have seen upside in adding those products. “I think that may have made the deal a lot more attractive … especially after the past couple of months of Kenvue’s stock price decline,” he said. Kenvue and Tylenol have been thrust into the national spotlight this year as President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and the complex brain disorder autism. Trump then urged pregnant women against using the medicine. That went beyond Food and Drug Administration advice that doctors “should consider minimizing” the painkiller acetaminophen’s use in pregnancy — amid inconclusive evidence about whether too much could be linked to autism. Kennedy reiterated the FDA guidance during a press conference last week. He said that there isn’t sufficient evidence to link the drug to autism. “We have asked physicians to minimize the use to when it’s absolutely necessary,” he said. Kenvue has continued to push back on the Trump administration’s public statements about Tylenol and acetaminophen, the active ingredient it contains. “We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents,” Kenvue said in a statement on its website. The merger could face other hurdles. Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni said he is concerned about the deal’s size given the recent history in the sector, particularly given the challenges faced by Kenvue. In July, Kenvue announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving in the midst of a strategic review, with the company under mounting pressure from activist investors unhappy about growth. Critics say Kenvue has relied too much on its legacy brands and failed to innovate. Industry analysts also point out the poor track record for mergers involving consumer packaged goods companies. In September, Kraft Heinz said it would break up its decade-old merger. Its net revenue has fallen every year since 2020. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue, like Kraft Heinz, are facing increasing competition from cheaper store brands. In 2024, 51% of toilet paper and other household paper products sold in the U.S were store brands, according to Circana, a market research company, while store brands held a 24% share of sales of health products, including medications and vitamins. On Monday, a bottle of 100 extra-strength Tylenol caplets cost $10.97 on Walmart’s website. A bottle of 100 extra-strength acetaminophen caplets from Walmart’s Equate brand cost $1.98. Inflation drove some of that buyer behavior, Circana said. Shoppers are also shifting their purchases to stores with more private-label brands, like Aldi and Costco. And stores are improving their offerings and adding more of them; last year, Walmart and Target both launched new store brands to complement their existing ones. Still, both Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue make name-brand products in segments where consumers are less likely to shift to store brands, including hair care, skin care, feminine products and mouth care, according to Circana. Kenvue owns brands like Aveeno and Neutrogena, for example, while Kimberly-Clark makes Kotex and Depend. Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu will be chairman and CEO of the combined company. Three members of the Kenvue’s board will join Kimberly-Clark’s board at closing. The combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark’s headquarters in Irving, Texas, but there will be significant operations around Kenvue facilities and locations as well. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both both companies. Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction’s closing. ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: BofA boss Brian Moynihan forced by board, restless shareholders to hold first investor day in 14 years: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/04/business/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-to-hold-his-first-investor-day-since-2011/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
It took him long enough. This week, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan will hold his first “investor day” since 2011 – breaking 14 years of silence that nicely highlights the positively awful job he has done communicating with investors. Insiders say that 66-year-old Moynihan, who only recently laid out a succession plan, was likely prodded to call the Wednesday powwow by his board, which is fielding shareholder demands for a clear plan to boost the bank’s stock price – and a strategy to compete against its archrival, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan Chase. BofA is the US’s second-largest bank by assets, right behind JPM. But by many other metrics, it’s an also-ran. Its stock perennially lags JPM’s – and all the other big banks, for that matter. It fails to win big banking assignments that go to JPM and Goldman Sachs. Nor does it capitalize on trading volatility because it’s been so risk averse. Insiders blame Moynihan, a lawyer by training who cut his managerial teeth as general counsel of Fleet Boston, which was among the multitude of acquisitions that led to the creation of the modern BofA. He took over as CEO in 2010, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis that nearly caused BofA to collapse. Moynihan won praise for his early caution, but according to critics inside and out of the bank, he’s been running the place the same way ever since by scaling back on risk and merely managing the bank’s balance sheet. It’s the reason why the stock has lagged JPMorgan and all of the Big 6 banks. Critics say part of Moynihan’s problem is that he never left Boston. He still manages BofA’s sprawling operations there with a few confidantes, even though its main headquarters is in New York (with a huge hub in Charlotte where it was once domiciled before its massive expansion). The investor day is being held not in NYC but in Boston. Another problem is BofA’s board. It’s considered among the most CEO-friendly in finance, which is why Moynihan didn’t set a succession timetable until recently (he wants to stay in job for the next five years). “The board and those that he surrounds himself with have allowed him to operate this way for some time,” said one BofA insider. “At some point, it becomes overly obvious how much of an outlier you are to your peers.” A BofA spokesman said it’s “completely untrue” that the board prodded him to hold the annual meeting or announce his succession plans. “The day gives us a chance to tell the comprehensive story of our franchise, how we are growing each of our businesses, and the opportunities for growth in the future,” the spokesman said, adding that analysts are starting to buy into Moynihan’s future growth plans. As many as 25 analysts now have buy recommendations on BofA stock. Whether it’s because of pressure from the board, his employees, investors or all three, Moynihan has been more visible lately. In addition to creating a succession plan and elevating a trio of executives to pole positions to succeed him, Moynihan has been doing media as he attempts to explain BofA’s new strategy. His new soundbite is “responsible growth”. Company insiders say Moynihan is still a firm believer in avoiding balance sheet risk, so don’t expect big trading profits when the markets get crazy like you see from Goldman Sachs. BofA also doesn’t post surprise trading losses. One metric Moynihan’s flacks keep touting: The bank recorded more than a dozen years of consistent growth in its sales and trading division. Which means when you cut through the spin, his strategy is more of the same. It’s important to note Moynihan’s caution has cost his shareholders money. In 2021, his team misread interest rates and dived headfirst into super safe treasuries that got crushed when inflation spiked and the Fed raised interest rates. A key reason that BofA — despite its massive balance sheet — remains an also-ran is that he hasn’t allowed traders to use that balance sheet even to support client deals, thus it doesn’t get the best client assignments, insiders say.

On Wednesday, Moynihan won’t be the only one doing the talking; more than a dozen BofA executives are expected to speak including the three men poised to take his job: Dean Athanasia, head of regional banking, chief financial officer Alastair Borthwick and Jim DeMare, head of global markets. DeMare is seen to have the inside track on the inside track because of the bank’s new found love of taking capital markets risk, albeit in a responsible manner – whatever that means. Advertisement

Title: Bitcoin’s Last Support Before $100K Breaks as 'Mag 7' Skew Flips, Oracle CDS Surges

Bitcoin BTC$104,590.85 has fallen below a key support level that had been holding back a slide toward $100,000, amid weakening momentum in tech stocks. The leading cryptocurrency fell below $106,000 during Asian trading hours, penetrating the level that had offered support multiple times in recent weeks, according to CoinDesk data. Major altcoins such as ether ETH$3,542.68, XRP$2.3324 and solana SOL$164.05, with SOL sliding to $157, the lowest since Aug. 3. Ether also fell to its lowest since August, with a bear cross of key moving averages pointing to strengthening of downside momentum and XRP hit a three-week low. BTC's breakdown shifts focus to the $100,000-$101,000 area, according to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. A violation there could open the door to a deeper test near $94,000, or even a full retracement toward $85,000, the maximum pain zone that also aligns with strong on-chain support, Thielen said in a note to clients. "While such a move would be extreme, downside risk remains contained as long as bitcoin holds above its prevailing downtrend line," he added. BTC's dour price action follows dwindling odds of rapid Fed rate cuts and signs of bullish turnaround in the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies. Furthermore, there are signs of overexuberance in the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla — which is typically seen at major market tops. "The put-call skew in the Mag7 complex inverted for the first time since December of last year (i.e. implied volatility of calls traded over puts). This phenomenon has only happened a handful of times. The move implies investors are overwhelmingly positioned for continued upside," analyst Neil Sethi said on X, quoting Goldman Sachs. "Historically, such low skew readings have tended to coincide with short-term consolidation or reversals as optimism peaks," Sethi added. At the same time, the credit default swap (CDS) tied to Oracle, which measures the cost of insuring against a potential default, has surged following the company’s massive third-quarter AI investment disclosures – reaching levels not seen outside periods of significant macro stress. This, according to some analysts, represents investor anxiety regarding the booming AI spending. AI optimism has been one of the major drivers of the bull market in both stocks and wider risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, since 2023. All things considered, bulls might be better off being cautious rather than overly exuberant.
