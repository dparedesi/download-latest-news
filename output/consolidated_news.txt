Two days out from the first of the two warm-up games before the Women’s Rugby World Cup in England, Clíodhna Moloney-MacDonald is reflective. With 43 Ireland caps to date, she is one of the players lining out against Scotland on Saturday in Cork who was involved in the home World Cup back in 2017. “I think a lot has changed,” says Moloney-MacDonald. “The tournament structure has changed hugely. The numbers that go have changed hugely. Women’s rugby has advanced a lot. So while I might have experience – and people will be asking me questions anyway – that’s not World Cup relevant. “I’ve been around a long time, I do know a lot of players from other countries and how they play. I’ve experienced playing against a lot of other countries, even at a club level, like playing over in England [with Exeter Chiefs], I would experience playing against a lot of these teams and players from these teams.” The landscape of women’s sport and women’s rugby has exploded since 2017, and Irish women’s rugby has been on an emotional rollercoaster, with more lows than highs in that time. Through all this, the support of family, friends, and fans has remained consistent. “[The 2017 World Cup] was a huge occasion, and getting to play in front of all your family and friends, it was amazing. That’s probably something that will remain the same. We’re as close as we could be to a home World Cup so the support element will hopefully be huge.” Saturday’s game at Musgrave Park and the following Saturday’s encounter with Canada at Ravenhill have been organised to give fans a chance to see off the team in style before they set up base in England. “People can fly over from Shannon, Dublin and wherever, and there’s lots of games all over the country,” says Moloney-MacDonald. “We want to give our team a great send-off and prepare ourselves as best as possible. But we also want to get people behind us a little bit. So performance is the main goal, but we do want to feel a little bit of support and love from the Irish people before we head off.” Managing those small things will be critical for this weekend’s first warm-up game against Scotland, who beat Ireland in the final Six Nations game earlier this year. “We were disappointed at the end of the Six Nations to lose that game, it’s not one that we should have lost, we feel,” admits Moloney-MacDonald. “We’ll want to put those things right, just for our performance, like the things we got wrong that day. We want to tidy up on them. But it is more about performing as a team in the way that we want to play and the way that we want to approach this World Cup.” Every game and every opponent is different, but the guiding goal is the same: getting to Twickenham for the World Cup final. “We know what we need to do at each stage but we’re not overestimating; this week is about Scotland, next week about Canada. Then it’s selection and getting there and then it’s each game at a time, and the pool games are each going to be very challenging in their own way.” Having the World Cup so close, and hopefully performing well, could help achieve another of the team’s goals: to fuel the growth of the game in Ireland. “We do have our goals individually and for each game, and obviously we need to get there first. But obviously the overall plan and strategy and everything is about growing the game in Ireland and that’s always in the back of our mind. “When we travel over to England, the lucky ones that get to go, we want to bring the sport with us, but we also want to leave a legacy from this World Cup in terms of our performance and how we are supported by the Irish people.” IRELAND (v Scotland, World Cup warm-up, Saturday, Musgrave Park, 2pm): Méabh Deely (Blackrock College/Connacht); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Nancy McGillivray (Exeter Chiefs)*, Eve Higgins (Railway Union/Leinster), Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Manawatū/Leinster); Siobhán McCarthy (Railway Union/Munster), Clíodhna Moloney-MacDonald (Exeter Chiefs), Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke/Ulster); Eimear Corri-Fallon (Blackrock College/Leinster), Sam Monaghan (Gloucester Hartpury/IQ Rugby) (capt); Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht)*, Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster).

Share this article Seven major asset managers – Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, Canary, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares – on Thursday submitted amended S-1 registration statements to the SEC for their proposed Solana (SOL) ETFs. The amendments represent the firms’ continued efforts to secure regulatory nod to expand their crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum products currently available to US investors. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas and ETF Store President Nate Geraci note that the revised filings demonstrate active engagement between the SEC and ETF issuers. Not really… but clearly dialogue w/ SEC and issuers are refining prospectus language. Gotta think fees in neighborhood of btc & eth ETFs. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 31, 2025 Industry experts project a 95% probability of SEC approval for spot Solana ETFs, though prospects are unclear for products incorporating staking features. Meanwhile, asset managers like BlackRock are seeking regulatory approval to incorporate staking into their existing spot Ethereum ETFs. Geraci suggests staked Ether ETFs could receive the next regulatory approval, following the SEC’s recent authorization of in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Several organizations, including Jito Labs, VanEck, Bitwise, the Solana Policy Institute, and Multicoin Capital, are advocating for the SEC to permit liquid staking in Solana-based ETPs. Liquid staking enables tokens to maintain liquidity while being staked, providing benefits such as enhanced capital efficiency, lower ETP operational costs, and expanded security and investor options.

Title: Dotdash, By The People, For The People; Mopping Up Social

Dashed Off On Tuesday, The Artist Formerly Known as Dotdash Meredith rebranded as People Inc. to reflect its best-known legacy brand. There are a number of reasons for the shift, including the fact that the previous name was simply “too clunky and cumbersome and weird,” Neil Vogel, People Inc.’s chief executive, tells The Wall Street Journal. Rebranding as People Inc. also pays homage to one of the company’s greatest successes: People’s monthly desktop and mobile visits more than doubled between June 2020 and June 2025, the WSJ reports. By comparison, some now former DDM publications, like Vanity Fair, saw a more than 50% decrease in monthly visits. The new name also reflects that “we are people making content for people,” Vogel tells The Hollywood Reporter. In an era of media marked by what Vogel referred to as “synthetic and artificial and amalgamated and mashed up” content, People Inc. will apparently put the “people” in, well, you get it. With print sales declining and media strategies shifting to new channels like TikTok, “we’ve learned that not all of our brands are going to have a future, and that’s okay,” Vogel tells THR. Instead, People will focus its attention on the channels seeing the most success – which, like People magazine, are those with “the history and the gravitas,” according to Vogel. Influence In The Aisle Fortune 500 consumer product brands like Unilever and Estée Lauder are suddenly all in on influencer marketing. Unilever’s new CMO, for one, vowed to spend as much as half of its paid media on influencer marketing. Procter & Gamble, the world’s highest-spending CPG advertiser, provided another example of this trend during its earnings report this week. For the new Swiffer PowerMop launch, P&G brought in TikTok and social media influencers to review the mop and speak with the execs who designed the product, CEO Jon Moeller told investors. The Swiffer team’s footage, together with the content created by influencers, is what P&G used to develop its TV and online video ads, he said. Moeller credited the PowerMop launch with kickstarting 40% growth for Swiffer’s portfolio and driving 35% of category growth, “making it the No. 1 growth driver in the category.” Bite Of The Apple Apple’s iOS 26 is slated to go live this month. One much-ballyhooed feature is the automatic filtering of unknown callers and text message senders to a new folder akin to spam. Politicians and political campaigners are alarmed because those messages are the meat and potatoes of political fundraising, Business Insider reports. Patrick Ruffini, a conservative pollster, notes in a Twitter thread that polling will be deeply affected. Online polls are not reliable and cannot be localized. The best, most reliable polling, like the NYT/Siena poll, relies on the exact methods being targeted by iOS 26. On the other hand, people universally hate the practice and will applaud Apple’s update. And, to be fair, political campaigns brought this on themselves. In 2020, all of the mobile wireless networks promoted their new anti-spam and scam policies, which affected some political messaging practices. A few weeks later, the Trump reelection campaign’s text fundraising campaign was suspended, because all the new systems identified it as spam, if not a scam. This precipitated vast congressional blowback, and the wireless networks later relented on those rules. But Wait! There’s More!

Title: SEC Chair Discusses American Leadership in Digital Finance — Project Crypto
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/08/01/sec-chair-discusses-american-leadership-in-digital-finance-project-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T04:01:15Z
Full Content:
It gives me great pleasure to be with you all, particularly at what I believe is a defining moment for American leadership in the crypto asset markets. Before I share a few reflections, I want to thank the America First Policy Institute for convening such a timely conversation. And, I must note, in order to keep my compliance folks happy, that the views I express here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners. *** Today, I would like to discuss what Commissioner Hester Peirce and I are calling “Project Crypto,” which will be the SEC’s north star in aiding President Trump in his historic efforts to make America the “crypto capital of the world.”[1] But before I discuss our plan for crypto market primacy, let me take a few moments to revisit some inflection points in the history of our financial markets that bear similarities to the one we are at now, so that the future we shape is worthy of the legacy that we inherit. The winds of innovation have always swept through our capital markets, often at gale force. In 1792, they rustled the leaves of a buttonwood tree, beneath which two dozen stockbrokers assembled to establish the forerunner to the New York Stock Exchange. That modest agreement—fewer than a hundred words handwritten on a slip of parchment—set in motion an elegant design that would govern the flow of capital for generations.[2] In the centuries since, our markets have never stood still. They have expanded, evolved, and reinvented themselves in step with the ideas and technologies of their time. Markets are dynamic because of the people who participate in them. Markets channel human ingenuity toward society’s most intractable problems by rewarding those who develop the most innovative solutions that others value enough to buy. They are the mechanism by which Adam Smith’s invisible hand elevates those who act in the common good—even when pursuing their own. The SEC’s role is to safeguard markets that allow the spark of human creativity and skill to benefit society. Over the arc of its history, the agency has both enabled innovation and, regrettably at times, stifled it. Fortunately, progress has a way of prevailing. And when our regulatory posture is calibrated to meet innovation with thoughtfulness rather than fear, America’s leadership position has only grown stronger. *** In the 1960s—before my time, I am happy to say—Wall Street was riding a bull market. But behind the scenes, our market machinery was straining to keep up. Most clearing and settlement transactions involved a costly and cumbersome process. Rising stacks of paper stock certificates had to be physically delivered by clerks wheeling carts up and down Wall Street and in other financial districts all across America.[3] It was a scene from another century struggling to meet the demands of the modern securities markets. Indeed, the paper-based clearance and settlement systems, built for a gentler era, began to buckle under the weight of soaring volumes. Delays at one firm held up the work of another. Securities were lost or stolen. Fails ballooned. And many thinly capitalized broker-dealers were caught by the whiplash of scuttled transactions. In desperation, trading hours were reduced and exchanges eventually closed on Wednesdays to allow firms to process the mountains of certificates. The breakdown over an antiquated system was described by the SEC chairman at the time as “the most prolonged and severe crisis in the securities industry in 40 years… Firms failed. Investor confidence plummeted.” And very much to its credit, the SEC was proactive in remedying the so-called “Paperwork Crisis.” The agency helped market participants to develop the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which would transform how securities were held and traded.[4] Instead of shuffling paper certificates from customer to broker, broker to broker, and broker to customer, title to shares could now be transferred through computerized ledger entries.[5] The certificates themselves were immobilized, stored securely in vaults, as ownership moved electronically, laying the foundation for the modern clearing and settlement system that has continued to this day. The ticker tape machine—like the one here—was also a breakthrough of its time, revolutionizing how Americans accessed market information, line by line, trade by trade.[6] But breakthroughs don’t belong in the past. By the late 1990s, electronic trading systems surged in popularity, unsettling old assumptions about how markets should function. Chairman Arthur Levitt likewise believed it behooved the SEC to provide regulatory flexibility for the electronic markets to innovate.[7] So, Regulation Alternative Trading Systems, or “Reg ATS,” adopted in 1999, allowed for ATSs to be regulated like broker-dealers, rather than like exchanges.[8] So, this brings me to today. To a moment that demands American ambition. To a project that can unleash it. Our regulatory framework need not be anchored to an analog past—unkind to new frontiers. After all, the future is arriving at full speed—and the world is not waiting. America must do more than just keep pace with the digital asset revolution. We must drive it. So today, I would like the world to go on notice that under my leadership, the SEC will not stand idly by and watch innovations develop overseas while our capital markets remain stagnant. To achieve President Trump’s vision of making America the crypto capital of the world, the SEC must holistically consider the potential benefits and risks of moving our markets from an off-chain environment to an on-chain one. We are at the threshold of a new era in the history of our markets. As I mentioned earlier, today I am announcing the launch of “Project Crypto”—a Commission-wide initiative to modernize the securities rules and regulations to enable America’s financial markets to move on-chain. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, ensuring that America will continue to lead in global payments with a gold standard stablecoin regulatory framework. Upon signing the GENIUS Act into law, I was pleased that President Trump endorsed Congressional efforts to pass crypto market structure legislation by the end of the year. I commend the House of Representatives for garnering such strong bipartisan support, and I look forward to working with the Senate as they build off the House’s work and craft market structure legislation that future proofs our markets against regulatory mischief, cementing the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Yesterday, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released the PWG Report with clear recommendations for the SEC and other federal agencies to build a framework to maintain U.S. dominance in crypto asset markets. This report is the blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology. The President said last week that he wants “the entire world running on the backbone of American technology.”[9] I stand ready to help get that job done. That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the PWG’s recommendations. Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”[10] Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate. In accord with the PWG Report’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to draft clear and simple rules of the road for crypto asset distributions, custody, and trading for public notice and comment. While the Commission staff works to finalize these regulations, the Commission and its staff will in the coming months consider using interpretative, exemptive, and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America. Many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations do not make sense in the twenty-first century—let alone for on-chain markets. The Commission must revamp its rulebook so that regulatory moats do not hinder progress and competition—from both new entrants and incumbents—to the detriment of Main Street.[11] Now, Project Crypto will involve a broad range of initiatives across the Commission. First, we will work to bring crypto asset distributions back to America. The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over. President Trump has said that America is in its Golden Age—and under our new agenda, our crypto asset economy will be, too. In line with the PWG Report, a key priority of mine will be to establish—as swiftly as we can—a regulatory framework for distributions of crypto assets in America. Capital formation is at the heart of the SEC’s mission, yet for too long the SEC ignored market demands for choice and disincentivized crypto-based capital raising.[12] As a result, crypto markets pivoted away from offering crypto assets and deprived investors of the opportunity to use this technology to contribute to productive economic enterprises. The SEC’s head-in-the-sand posture—as well as its shoot first, ask questions later approach—are days of the past. Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities. But confusion over the application of the “Howey test” has led some innovators to prophylactically treat all crypto assets as such. American entrepreneurs are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize a broad range of legacy systems and instruments. One such entrepreneur is Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a successful businessman and freshman senator, who before his election to the Senate founded a company that put car titles on the blockchain.[13] He saw a need for efficiency in transferring titles and devised a practical solution with the new technology. These entrepreneurs need—and deserve—bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses. I have directed the Commission staff to work to develop clear guidelines that market participants can use to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or subject to an investment contract. Our goal is to help market participants to slot crypto assets into categories, such as digital collectibles, digital commodities, or stablecoins, and assess the economic realities of a transaction. This approach can allow market participants to determine, based upon clear guidelines, whether any outstanding promises or commitments of the issuer cause the crypto asset to be subject to an investment contract. In addition, it should not be a scarlet letter to be deemed a security. We need a regulatory framework for crypto asset securities that allows these products to flourish within American markets. Many issuers will prefer the flexibility in product design that the securities laws afford, and investors will benefit from the opportunity to earn distributions, voting rights, and other features typical of securities. Projects should not be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations and offshore foundations or decentralize too early if this is not their desired plan of action. I am excited to see new use cases for crypto asset securities in commerce, such as the ability to participate in blockchain network consensus with tokenized equities. Thus, for those crypto asset transactions that are subject to the securities laws, I have asked staff to propose purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors, including for so-called “initial coin offerings,” “airdrops,” and network rewards. Regarding these sorts of transactions, our goal should be that issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits,[14] but instead choose to include Americans to enjoy legal certainty and an accommodating regulatory environment. It is my view that a Cambrian explosion in innovation could occur if we stay true to this course. Additionally, many firms seek to “tokenize” their common stock, bonds, partnership interests, and other securities, or tokenize the securities of third parties.[15] Much of this innovation is offshore today due to regulatory challenges in the United States. I also hear from our regulatory policy staff that firms—from household names on Wall Street to unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley—are lined up at our doors with requests to tokenize. I have asked the Commission staff to work with firms seeking to distribute tokenized securities within the United States and to provide relief where appropriate to assure that Americans are not left behind. Second, to achieve the President’s goals, it is incumbent on the SEC to ensure that market participants have maximum choice when deciding where to custody and trade crypto assets. As I have said before, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a core American value.[16] I believe deeply in the right to use a self-custodial digital wallet to maintain personal crypto assets and participate in on-chain activities like staking. However, some investors will continue to rely on SEC registrants, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to hold assets on their behalf, and these firms are subject to additional regulatory requirements when they do so. It will be a priority of my chairmanship to carry out the PWG Report’s recommendation to modernize the SEC’s custody requirements for registered intermediaries. The prior Administration’s “special-purpose broker-dealer” framework, SAB 121, and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” resulted in a dearth of custodial service provider options in the market today.[17] The existing custody rules were created without crypto assets in mind. I have directed the staff to consider how best to adapt the existing regime to facilitate the custody of crypto assets, including possible exemptive or other relief, in addition to changes to the rules themselves. As the PWG Report recommends, market participants “should be permitted to engage in multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible.” We should not force market participants to be stretched to fit a Procrustean bed of regulation for regulation’s sake. I am in favor of affording them the freedom to choose the most efficient regulatory framework for their business, provided that the framework adequately protects investors. Third, a key priority of my chairmanship is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps.”[18] I am often asked, “What do you mean by a super-app?” Plain and simple: securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license. A broker-dealer with an alternative trading system should be able to offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and other services, like crypto asset staking and lending, without requiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses. Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits SEC-registered trading venues from listing non-securities on their platforms today, and I have directed the Commission staff to develop further guidance and proposals ultimately to make this “super-app” vision a reality. Maybe they’ll call it “Reg Super-App.” Consistent with the PWG Report, the SEC in concert with other regulators should strive to have the most efficient licensing structure for SEC registrants. They should not be unnecessarily subject to multiple regulators or regulatory regimes. This model has worked well for banks, which are broadly exempted from many duplicative regulatory frameworks, such as broker-dealer and clearing agency registration. Regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation necessary to protect investors while allowing entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish. We should not overburden them with paternalistic regulation that could drive them offshore or make American companies less competitive internationally. Our regulators should unleash the forces of venue and product competition for the benefit of all Americans. We should not artificially constrain business models and impose duplicative regulatory costs on American businesses that favor the largest firms that are better able to bear the regulatory burdens. Per the PWG’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to develop a framework that will allow non-security crypto assets and crypto asset securities to be traded side-by-side on SEC-regulated platforms. Additionally, I have asked the staff to evaluate the use of Commission authority to permit non-security crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract to trade on trading venues that are not registered with the Commission. I am keen to pursue such a solution, as it will not only enable state-licensed crypto asset platforms that are not registered with the SEC to list certain crypto assets, but it also clears the way for CFTC-regulated platforms to offer these products with margin capabilities—even without Congress providing the CFTC with any additional authority, unlocking even greater liquidity for these assets. Fourth, I have directed the Commission staff to update antiquated agency rules and regulations to unleash the potential of on-chain software systems in our securities markets. On-chain software comes in many shapes and sizes—some of these systems are truly decentralized and not operated by any intermediary. Other on-chain software systems have an operator. Both types of on-chain software should have a place within our financial markets. It is essential that any crypto asset regulatory market structure create a path for software developers to unleash on-chain software systems that do not require operation by any central intermediary. Decentralized finance software systems—like automated market makers—facilitate automated, non-intermediated financial market activity. Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries that require regulation, but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation where the markets can function without them. We will create space in our markets for both models, by protecting pure publishers of software code, drawing reasonable lines to distinguish intermediated and disintermediated activity, and creating rational and workable rules of the road for intermediaries that seek to operate on-chain software systems. Decentralized finance and other forms of on-chain software systems will be part of our securities markets and not drowned out by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. To make this vision a reality, we will need to consider some changes to our rules. For example, accommodating trading of tokenized securities on-chain may require us to explore amendments to Reg NMS, in addition to what we otherwise would do in the normal course to correct market distortions that it engenders. Many of you will remember that I co-authored with Commissioner Cynthia Glassman a lengthy dissent to the adoption of Reg NMS twenty years ago last month.[19] This dissent is even more compelling now that we have had two decades of prescriptive requirements that distort market activity and impede the evolution of our securities markets. Congress clearly intended that “competitive forces, rather than unnecessary regulation, guide the development of the national market system.”[20] I will look for ways to bring us back in line with that intent and thereby promote innovation and competition in our markets. Finally, innovation and entrepreneurialism are the engines of the American economy. President Trump has described America as a “nation of builders.”[21] Under my leadership, the Commission will encourage our nation’s builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules. While the Commission is actively considering industry requests that could jumpstart innovative activity, we are also contemplating an innovation exemption that would allow registrants and non-registrants to quickly go to market with new business models and services that do not neatly fit within our existing rules and regulations. The Commission will continue to ensure that market participants adhere to certain conditions and requirements designed to achieve the policy aims of the federal securities laws. Under my vision for an innovation exemption, innovators and visionaries will be able to immediately enter the market with new technologies and business models but will not be required to comply with incompatible or burdensome prescriptive regulatory requirements that hinder productive economic activity. Instead, they will be able to comply with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve the core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643.[22] I encourage market participants and SEC staff alike to have an eye towards commercial viability when contemplating what various models could look like. *** As we advance these priorities, I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. This represents more than a regulatory shift—it is a generational opportunity. From the leaves of a buttonwood tree to ledgers on a blockchain, the winds of innovation still blow—and it is our task that they carry American leadership forward. After all, ladies and gentlemen, we have never been content to follow. We will not watch from the sidelines. We will lead. We will build. And, we will ensure that the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America. Thank you very much for your time today. I encourage you to be attentive to our coming announcements and proposals and, as always, I welcome your thoughtful comments and suggestions.

Title: SOS — Save Our Shipping: Trump must break China’s chokehold on global trade
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/opinion/sos-trump-must-break-chinas-global-shipping-chokehold/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T23:59:58Z
Full Content:
A high-stakes deal that would give an American company a major role in running dozens of strategically crucial global ports is now in limbo — as China aggressively demands a stake. The United States cannot let that happen. US asset manager BlackRock and its partners are vying for 43 of the world’s most important shipping ports, including the two that straddle the Panama Canal. The seller is C.K. Hutchison, a major Hong Kong operator that is one of China’s “big three” port giants — and the only one not owned outright by the Chinese government. Prying these ports from China’s oversight is a critical move for both US national security and the global economy. Now the Chinese Communist Party is trying to block the deal, unless its state-owned COSCO joins the buyers’ group and gains veto rights over port operations. Alarmingly, all three main parties are reportedly open to letting that happen, apparently thinking that a compromised deal is better than no deal at all. But with all that’s at stake, President Donald Trump should use every tool available — starting with the ongoing US-China trade talks — to push the original deal through and keep COSCO out. The 43 ports that Hutchison seeks to sell would launch a global liberation from oppressive Chinese surveillance and control. If the plan falls through — or if it’s altered to add COSCO to the ownership group — China could tighten its grip on the global shipping system, by replacing a Beijing-influenced company with a Beijing-controlled one. While the media has dubbed this the “Panama Canal deal,” it’s actually much bigger. The canal, a vital artery that runs through the center of the western hemisphere, is certainly critical — but many of the other ports involved in the deal are equally so. For example, this deal would include a port inside the Malacca Strait, the only direct maritime pathway between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It sees 90,000 ships and $3.5 trillion worth of global trade every year. Hutchison is also looking to sell five ports that it owns on both sides of the Suez Canal, the preferred maritime commercial route between the Asian and European markets. About 12% of global trade, $1 trillion a year, passes through Suez. As China’s purchases of sanctioned Iranian oil draw greater US scrutiny, Hutchison’s four ports on the southern side of the Strait of Hormuz are also critical. Nearly all Iranian oil must pass through the strait, along with oil and gas from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. In Europe, Hutchison controls 13 ports that act as a key entry point for Chinese goods into the European Union. The original deal would reduce China’s port foothold on the continent — and the geopolitical influence that comes with it. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Like all major commercial deals, this one is complicated. Apart from the two Panama Canal ports, BlackRock would retain 20% ownership of the remaining facilities; its partner, Europe-based Mediterranean Shipping Corp., would control 70%, with Singapore’s Sovereign Wealth Fund owning the rest. Meanwhile, China’s power in global shipping is massive. China produces 95% of world shipping containers and all of the refrigerated ones. Ports around the world are plugged into China’s logistical software platform, LOGINK, which tracks sensitive trade, market, maritime and passenger data. Huawei’s “Smart Port” 5G telecommunication towers provide Wi-Fi — and ready surveillance capacity — at ports worldwide. A Chinese state-owned company makes more than 70% of the world’s ship-to-shore cranes (and 80% of the cranes used in America) — a major risk, according to the House Homeland Security Committee, which has alleged those cranes may be engaging in covert surveillance on behalf of the CCP. Adding state-owned COSCO to ports deal would give the CCP the power to veto any attempts to replace Huawei towers, LOGINK systems, Chinese cranes or other tools that may already be spying on behalf of the state. With BlackRock’s minority interest in the vast bulk of these ports, replacing a private Chinese company with a state-owned one is even worse for the United States than the status quo. Breaking China’s maritime monopoly is urgent. At the same time, America’s economic leverage has never been higher. As Beijing trumps up patently absurd anti-monopoly investigations to stall or scuttle the BlackRock-MSC deal, the United States should Trump right back. He must make the choice clear: Access to American markets cannot continue unless Beijing releases its maritime monopoly.

Title: Gloomy guidance and increased cloud competition weigh on Amazon’s stock, despite solid earnings beat
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/07/31/gloomy-guidance-increased-cloud-competition-weigh-amazons-stock-despite-solid-earnings-beat/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T23:36:36Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 19:36 EDT / JULY 31 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Amazon.com Inc. were trading more than 6% lower after-hours today, after the e-commerce and cloud computing infrastructure giant could only offer light guidance for the current quarter. The decline came in the wake of some fairly decent numbers from Amazon as it posted its second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street’s targets on earnings and revenue. Amazon reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $1.68 per share, easily beating the $1.33 per share forecast, while revenue for the quarter came to $167.7 billion, up 13% from a year ago and ahead of the $162.09 billion analyst consensus estimate. The company also reported operating income of $19.2 billion for the quarter, up from $14.7 billion in the year-ago period, while net income came to $18.2 billion, up from $13.5 billion 12 months prior. However, what disturbed investors was the company’s miserable operating income outlook. Amazon said this could fall anywhere between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion, but the midpoint of that range is substantially lower than Wall Street’s forecast of $19.48 billion. The guidance appears to have caused panic among investors, who are increasingly concerned about the company’s sky-high artificial intelligence investments. Amazon has previously committed to spending up to $100 billion this year on building out the data centers to run AI models, and software that makes use of them. Amazon’s stock headed south during a conference call, where Chief Executive Andy Jassy (pictured) was busy fielding some tough questions from analysts regarding the level of spending and the increased competition it faces in the cloud. Jassy did his best to emphasize that Amazon retains a “significant” cloud leadership position, adding that he’s “optimistic” about the strength of its AI products and services. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” Jassy said in a statement. With regard to the cloud, the Amazon Web Services Inc. business unit delivered total sales of $30.87 billion in the quarter, up 18% from a year ago and just ahead of the Street’s forecast of $30.8 billion. AWS continues to dominate the cloud computing infrastructure market, but its lead isn’t as big as it was, for it faces relentless competition in the face of Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC, and also even smaller players like Oracle Corp. and dedicated AI cloud providers, such as CoreWeave Inc. The company’s substantial lead in cloud makes it much harder for AWS to match those rival’s growth rates. While AWS revenue was up 18%, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud recorded growth rates of 39% and 32% in their most recent quarters, which means they’re slowly chipping away at Amazon’s lead. “We have a meaningfully larger business in the AWS segment than others,” Jassy told analysts in response to a question about the threat posed by those rivals. “I think the second player is about 65% of the size of AWS.” AWS continues to be a major driver of profit for Amazon, generating operating income of $10.2 billion during the quarter, representing just over half of the company’s total. During the quarter, AWS revealed plans to open a new data center region in Chile before 2027, and said Pepsi Co. has signed up for a large multiyear contract that will see it move various critical workloads to the AWS cloud. Jassy insisted that customers continue to choose AWS because they see it as the industry’s most secure cloud infrastructure platform. “For most companies, they’re putting data that they really care about into the cloud,” he told analysts. “The security and privacy of that data matters a lot, and there are very different results in security in AWS than you’ll see in other players.” The results from Amazon’s advertising business were more encouraging, with ad revenue rising 23% from a year earlier to $15.69 billion, surging past the analyst target of $14.99 billion. Of course, the ad business remains much smaller than AWS or the company’s retail business, but it’s still responsible for a growing chunk of Amazon’s profits, as the world’s third-largest ad platform, behind only Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. last week reported that ad sales rose 10% in its most recent quarter, while Meta said yesterday that its ad revenue climbed 22%, slightly slower than Amazon’s, both off a bigger base. As for retail, sales in Amazon’s online stores increased 11% from a year earlier to $61.5 billion, surpassing the Street’s target of $59 billion, while the seller services unit delivered $40.3 billion in revenue, also up 11%. Analysts were expecting just $38.7 billion in sales there. Some analysts were more bullish about the company’s prospects. “In the end Amazon operates two high-margin growthy businesses and a massive low-margin logistics business with unmatched scale with the potential to materially juice margins medium to long term using AI in combination with robotics,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeff Wlodarczak said in a note to clients. The firm raised its target price to $285 a share and reiterated its buy rating. Amazon’s prediction for third-quarter revenue was a little better, at least. The company estimates sales of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion, which would mean growth of between 10% and 13%. That’s more optimistic than the Street, with analysts aiming for just $173.1 billion in third-quarter sales. Once again, Amazon’s guidance came with a caveat that warned how “recessionary fears” and “tariff and trade policies” could yet affect its results in unforeseen ways. The constantly shifting trade polices of U.S. President Donald Trump could potentially have a big impact on Amazon’s retail business, though consumer spending has so far proven resilient this year. On the conference call, Jassy told analysts that the tariffs haven’t impacted on consumer demand, nor have they driven up prices, as some had feared. “If costs end up being a little higher, we will absorb them,” he added. The after-hours price drop means that Amazon’s stock is up just over 6% in the year to date, trailing the broader S&P 500 Index, which has gained 8% in the same period.

Speaking with CNBC, billionaire banking boss Dimon said that stablecoins could be used in ways that fiat currency can't. "There are things that stablecoins maybe can do that your traditional cash can't," Dimon said, although he emphasized that the bank was looking to address client demand more than the bank's preferences. "It's what the customer wants," he said. "It's not what JP Morgan personally wants." Dimon's comments underscored his reservations about digital assets. Still, he expressed his belief in the potential usefulness of blockchain technology and his willingness to allow the banking giant to participate in the space. JP Morgan has introduced multiple cryptocurrency-focused initiatives in recent months. Earlier this week, JP Morgan announced a deal with America's largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, allowing customers to link their accounts to the platform and buy digital assets. Dimon has also recently praised stablecoins, a perspective he reiterated to CNBC. "I'm not against stablecoins," Dimon said. "I'm a believer in stablecoin, a believer in blockchain, not personally a believer in Bitcoin itself, but you're the customer—I don't like to tell customers what they can and can't do with their money." Stablecoins are digital tokens running on blockchains—like Ethereum or Solana—that are pegged to non-volatile assets, usually dollars. With a stable value, such cryptocurrencies were previously used by traders to enter and exit digital asset trades without the need for banks. But now, banks, major companies, including Meta and Amazon, and even U.S. states are all interested in issuing the tokens, which are supposed to accelerate payments leveraging blockchain technology. This month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a framework for issuing and trading stablecoins in the U.S. JP Morgan's Coinbase deal means that Chase customers will be able to directly link bank accounts to their cryptocurrency wallets from next year. The bank also said it will "seamlessly and securely convert their points into cryptocurrencies." Publicly-traded Coinbase is the biggest exchange in the U.S. and allows users to buy, sell, and bet on the future price of digital coins and tokens. It also has a deal with the U.S. government to take custody of confiscated crypto. In the past, Dimon had been unsparing in his comments on Bitcoin, calling it a "pet rock" and valuable only to criminals. The bank has used blockchain technology in its products, though. NYSE-listed JP Morgan's stock was down by a little over 1% Thursday. Coinbase—which trades on the Nasdaq—was up marginally, by less than 1%.

Visa also said that clients using Visa's stablecoin services can accept the tokens via Avalanche and Stellar, too. Previously, Visa's stablecoin services were limited to blockchains Ethereum and Solana. Avalanche is a crypto network behind AVAX, the 22nd largest digital asset by market cap, and Stellar's native token, XLM, is the industry's 16th biggest crypto. AVAX was recently trading for $22.59, down more than 2.4% on the day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. XLM remained unchanged at $0.40. NYSE-listed Visa's stock, meanwhile, finished the day down by 1.5%, according to Google Finance data. "We believe that when stablecoins are trusted, scalable, and interoperable, they can fundamentally transform how money moves around the world," Visa's Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships at Visa, Rubail Birwadker, said in a statement. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies typically pegged to stable assets such as the U.S. dollar to minimize price volatility. They were initially used primarily by traders to move funds without relying on traditional banks. But now, banks, major companies—including Meta and Amazon, reportedly—and even U.S. states are all interested in issuing stablecoins, which are supposed to accelerate payments using blockchain technology. Earlier this month, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, marking the first comprehensive federal framework for the issuance and regulation of stablecoins in the U.S. The legislation outlines requirements for issuers, sets standards for reserves and audits, and establishes clear rules for how stablecoins can be used and traded across financial markets. In 2021, Visa announced that it supported USD Coin on Ethereum. Since then, the company has introduced a number of other crypto-related ventures. In April, it partnered with Bridge, a unit of payment services provider Stripe, to offer stablecoin-linked debit cards in Latin American countries.

Title: Defense Spending Could Protect Your Investment Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/31/defense-spending-could-protect-your-investment-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T22:48:42Z
Full Content:
BySteven Dudash BySteven Dudash, Contributor. The U.S. defense industry is emerging as one of the most resilient sectors for investors. Amid global instability and rising geopolitical tensions, American policymakers are displaying a unique commitment to military strength. The recent passage of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”, a sweeping piece of legislation that pushes U.S. defense spending to historic highs, and a newly agreed upon EU – U.S. trade deal underscores this trend. The bill adds $150 billion in new funding to the Department of Defense, bringing total projected spending for the 2026 fiscal year to over $1 trillion. On top of that, the EU has committed to over $600 billion of military equipment procurement in the coming years. The signal to markets is undeniable: defense is a national and global priority. For investors, this presents an opportunity. Massive new capital is now earmarked for shipbuilding, advanced munitions, next-generation aircraft, and a new missile defense system dubbed the “Golden Dome.” Defense stocks, long considered cyclical or defensive, may now be positioned for long-term structural growth. Interestingly, this surge in spending comes even as U.S. military expenditures, as a share of GDP, sit at multi-decade lows. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global defense spending has climbed 37% over the past decade, but America’s share of that growth has not kept pace with its expanding economy. In short: U.S. defense spending is climbing fast in absolute terms, but relative to our economic size, there’s still plenty of runway ahead. Ongoing wars in Europe and the Middle East and intensifying tensions in the Indo-Pacific have forced governments across the globe to rethink their defense postures. In Europe, Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine has led to a dramatic increase in defense budgets across NATO member states. The 2% GDP target for defense spending has given way to a 5%+ target for European members, meaning our allies are finally putting their money where their mouth is – although those expenditures are far from guaranteed. For context, in 2024, the U.S. spent roughly $3,000 per citizen on national defense, more than four times what most European nations spent, according to an article from Barron’s. In Europe that number needs to rise meaningfully if they’re going to hit their NATO commitments. The Middle East is increasingly unstable. U.S. involvement in ongoing conflicts in the region, including efforts to deter Iran’s nuclear program and manage the persistent tensions between Israel and Palestine, continues to highlight the need for advanced missile defense systems, precision munitions, and rapid deployment capabilities. The conflict also highlights the expenses associated with war. Every rocket fired comes with a price tag and restocking munitions is expensive, especially when a conflict is hot and countries can’t afford to wait for supplies. The conflict in the Middle East is also indirectly expensive in that it introduces significant volatility into global oil markets. Iran, as a key OPEC member, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly 20% of the world’s petroleum supply passes. Any disruption here carries both economic and strategic consequences - further justifying elevated defense spending. Meanwhile, tensions in the Indo-Pacific region continue to build. China’s assertiveness around Taiwan and the South China Sea places it in direct competition with U.S. naval and diplomatic interests. The need to prepare for a potential conflict in the region has subtly been called to the forefront via Trump’s recent focus on shipbuilding and other maritime industries. U.S. naval power is extremely important if we were to see a real conflict develop here, but we need more ships. The U.S. market share in shipbuilding has plummeted to just 0.13% as of 2023, down from 5% in the 1970s, according to the U.S. Naval Institute. In contrast, China, Japan, and South Korea now account for over 90% of global shipbuilding capacity. As a result, the U.S. is more reliant on allies and commercial partnerships than ever before - a vulnerability that further underscores the need for investment. The international dimension of rising defense spending adds a powerful tailwind for U.S. contractors. In 2024, the U.S. Department of State reported that global arms transfers for the U.S. reached nearly $118 billion, and $97 billion of that was funded directly by U.S. allies and partners. American dominance in foreign military sales is accelerating, not just because of technological superiority, but because of interoperability. As Europe, the Middle East, and Asia expand their defense budgets, they are prioritizing systems that integrate seamlessly with U.S. platforms. Whether it’s the F-35 fighter jet or the Patriot missile system, American defense tech is becoming the global standard. This shift has economic implications as well. Defense remains one of the few areas where the U.S. still plays a leading role in high-value manufacturing, a strategic lever in our otherwise service-dominated economy. Arms exports give the U.S. a trade advantage, especially as reducing the trade deficit remains a priority for the Trump administration. The recently finalized EU-U.S. trade deal, which lowered blanket tariffs from 30% to 15%, also includes a pledge of $600 billion in EU military procurement. While the real flow of capital will depend on each country’s budget realities, demographics, and political might, the rhetoric alone has been enough to push European defense stocks lower. The market is betting the major U.S. defense contractors, commonly referred to as the primes, will ultimately be the benefactors. Between 2020 and 2024, the U.S. accounted for 43% of all global arms exports, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Key buyers include Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, and EU nations - many of which are now aiming for defense spending levels of 3–5% of GDP. For major U.S. firms like Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and RTX Corp. (RTX), this means multibillion-dollar order backlogs and increased income diversification. It also acts as a hedge against domestic budget volatility, reinforcing the fact that U.S. contractors don’t need to rely solely on Washington to grow. A growing portion of new defense dollars is being directed not just at traditional weaponry, but at artificial intelligence, autonomy, and next-generation battlefield technology. While tanks and missiles still matter, it’s AI, drones, and predictive analytics that will define the next phase of military dominance. Companies like Anduril Industries are at the forefront of this transformation. Their autonomous drone systems, battlefield command software, and AI surveillance tools are redefining how militaries perform in combat environments. The basis for all current and future R&D is that the U.S. military needs technology that is mass-producible and entirely replaceable. Unmanned and easily replaceable aircraft are a no-brainer for potential future conflicts. Meanwhile, Palantir Technologies (PLTR) continues to expand its work with the Department of Defense, building decision-intelligence platforms that help military leaders simulate outcomes and deploy resources more efficiently. These capabilities aren’t theoretical -they’re already being used in logistics, counterterrorism, and battlefield planning across several branches of the U.S. military. The software-first approach is here to stay. Beyond the battlefield, the digital domain is just as critical. Companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) are playing crucial roles behind the scenes, working alongside defense contractors to secure U.S. military networks and infrastructure. Their platforms are already being used to detect foreign intrusions, prevent ransomware attacks, and build cyber resilience across key defense systems. As cyberattacks from nation-state actors continue to escalate, the Pentagon is steadily shifting a greater portion of its IT and cybersecurity budget toward these firms, viewing them as essential partners in modern warfare. Tanks, aircraft, and ships are worthless if you can’t secure the digital infrastructure required for operations. And then there’s SpaceX. Its Starlink satellite network has become essential for battlefield communications, notably in Ukraine, and its ability to launch defense communications into low-Earth orbit has made the company indispensable to Pentagon strategy. The militarization of space is no longer a sci-fi concept - it’s a live and growing budget category. Taken together, these companies represent a shift from defense as a manufacturing industry to one centered around software, autonomy, and connected systems. Investors looking to position themselves for the next decade of military innovation would be wise to watch not only the legacy names - but also the disruptors. Ultimately, investing in the defense sector isn’t just about capitalizing on geopolitical unrest - it’s about understanding the structural realignment of global priorities. Defense is a central pillar of economic, technological, and industrial strategy. New legislation in the U.S. and international military spending commitments signal a paradigm shift. Multiyear visibility into global defense spending is music to the ears of the legacy contractors. Rising players in autonomous systems, cybersecurity, and satellite communications are building out the next generation of military infrastructure. There’s lots to be excited about, and investors looking for durable tailwinds in a shifting global order should take a look across the entire defense spectrum.

Mike Donilon, a senior advisor to former President Joe Biden, told congressional investigators he had no knowledge of the autopen or its use, a source familiar with his testimony told the Daily Caller. Donilon appeared Thursday before the House Oversight Committee as part of Chairman James Comer’s probe into Biden’s mental fitness and the administration’s use of the autopen. He had advised Biden since 1981, serving as a pollster, strategist and media consultant during Biden’s Senate tenure, according to his Harvard Institute of Politics biography.

He reportedly downplayed concerns over Biden’s debate performance, saying critics in the media and on Capitol Hill had overreacted. He conceded the former president’s presence was sometimes diminished and that he occasionally stumbled over words, but expressed frustration with the public’s fixation on Biden’s appearance. Donilon reiterated he had no knowledge of the autopen or how it was used. He previously served as counselor to then-Vice President Biden and led strategy, polling, messaging, advertising and speechwriting for Biden’s 2020 and 2024 campaigns.

(RELATED: House Oversight Committee Votes To Subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell For Deposition) Ricchetti and Donilon followed former Chief of Staff Ron Klain, who sat for several hours of questioning last week. Meanwhile, several close Biden associates — including former White House physician Kevin O’Connor, Jill Biden’s ex-chief of staff Anthony Bernal, and former aide Annie Tomasini — have recently invoked the Fifth Amendment before the committee.

By Blizzard Entertainment 7 hr 57 min ago Journey deeper into The War Within campaign in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update arriving on August 5. Explore a new zone, break ground in a new Delve, make an impact in Ecological Succession, and more. The War Within Season 3 also kicks off on August 12 with a new raid, new Mythic+ dungeon pool, and a fresh PvP season. In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga—Midnight. There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord. Home of the ethereals, K'aresh was once a vibrant world, but now it only exists as a fragmented void-touched world waiting for players to explore what remains of this little-known land. Though there are multiple points of interest for heroes to explore, including ethereal Eco-Domes where life still thrives. With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid to put a stop to him and his followers. [LEARN MORE] Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them. Once inside the market, find vendors, more quests, and portals. There are even portals to each of the four daily active Bountiful Delves. A coalition of Broker cartels and ethereals formed to accomplish an impossible goal—save their destroyed world from the All-Devouring. The K'aresh Trust is the seventh major faction of The War Within, and is based out of Tazavesh, located in what remains of K'aresh. Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps, can be used to transform into an energy form, much like the ethereals, to interact with the world in a new way. You'll use these wraps to take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more! [LEARN MORE] Reshii wraps will upgrade and scale with you, including new visuals as you progress through the content. Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world. You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious monsters for fun… and profit. Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new future. [LEARN MORE] Manaforge Omega, built to harness arcane power from the wastes of K’aresh, now hums with a sinister radiance. Within it, Nexus-King Salhadaar attempts to reawaken Dimensius, the All-Devouring, in a bid for ultimate power. The champions of Azeroth must disrupt Manaforge Omega’s operations or else risk a reborn Dimensius feasting on reality itself. [LEARN MORE] Raid Bosses Those bold enough to vanquish Dimensius, the All-Devouring, will earn the prestigious Royal Voidwing on Heroic difficulty—and for those who conquer him on Mythic, the elusive Unbound Star-Eater awaits. Upper Left: Royal Voidwing Lower Right: Unbound Star-Eater Manaforge Omega will also have a Raid Renown Track called Manaforge Vandals, similar to the Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club, filled with rewards like The Bone Freezer mount, and buffs to use once inside the raid. Dungeon Bosses The new seasonal rewards for Mythic+ include the two new titles: "the Unbound" and "the Unbound Hero", dungeon teleports, and two mounts: Azure Void Flyer and Scarlet Void Flyer. Scarlet Void Flyer Starting the week of August 12th, Tazavesh will also return as a full hard mode mega-dungeon and will count as a Mythic+10 once a week in the Great Vault. This mega-dungeon replaces the Mythic 0 difficulty for the season for both Tazavesh dungeons, and can be accessed by entering the Tazavesh instance and with all players in the party interacting with Al'dalil near the dungeon entrance to confirm they're ready to proceed. All bosses have a chance to drop Hero track loot, and completing the mega-dungeon will also grant players 30 Gilded Crests. An additional weekly reward is available for players who are able to defeat all bosses in the mega-dungeon without anyone in the party dying. Checkpoints are also evolving into Waystones, with a more visual representation of unlock checkpoints. A new icon will appear on the map showing you where Waystones within the zone can be found as well. Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are plundering the Delve. Upgrading and using the Reshii Wraps unlocks unique challenge gateways to powerful bosses and reveals hidden secrets when you revisit your favorite delves across Khaz Algar. You may also get a glimpse of your friends within the Delve as well or even /mourn them as you observe their ghost from where they died. There’s unfinished business with Nexus Princess Ky’veza as well and you’ll take her on one on one as this season's Nemesis. Delver's Mana-Skimmer Delver's Mana-Skimmer Schematic: Hyperdrive Along the Delver's Journey progression, unlock customizations for your Delver's Mana Skimmer–the newest Delve mount attainable during Season 3–and two new toys, the Delver's Mana-Bound Ethergate–opens a portal to return to the Explorers' League home base in Dornogal, and Etheric Brannmorpher–summons an Ethereal Transmorpher that can change your appearance. The ethereals of K'aresh first witnessed this destructive maw of the void after Dimensius's attack. They believe Reshanor has manifested as their eternal punishment - for it comes back around to keep eating them and their planet as he grows infinitely bigger over the years. From left to right: Death Knight, Warlock, Rogue From left to right: Paladin, Demon Hunter, Druid From left to right: Hunter, Priest, Warrior From left to right: Shaman, Evoker, Mage, Monk With a new season, also comes a new set of class gear. These new sets will feature set bonuses that will align with your chosen Hero Talents instead of your class or specialization. Astral Gladiator's Fel Bat The new season also brings a new PvP Ladder, increased item level gear, and new rewards: Arena title: "Astral Gladiator", Rated Solo Shuffle title: "Astral Legend", Rated Battleground Blitz title: "Astral Marshal" (Alliance) or "Astral Warlord" (Horde), a new weapon illusion: Arcane, tabard, cloak, pennants, weapon appearances, Astral Gladiator's Fel Bat, and new Vicious mounts–Alliance and Horde-themed Void Creepers. Several PvP talents will be updated with the content update; players will also be able to undertake a new World Quest to vanquish their foes on Vanquisher’s Wake island. This new point of interest is a perfect spot to hang out for those seeking to go toe-to-toe in some outdoor PvP battles. No quest required for entry. Simply turn on War Mode and enter with caution.

Title: A 13% Dividends From AI? Here Are The Tickers

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. By now you’ve no doubt heard the argument that AI is a bubble, and there’s no way Big Tech will make a significant profit from it, given the massive amounts of cash they’ve already piled in. That take is just plain wrong—truth is, the tech giants are already booking profits from AI. And we closed-end fund (CEF) investors can grab our share at a discount—and at dividend rates running all the way up to 13%, too. This next chart tells us straight-up why the “AI-is-unprofitable” theory is off the mark. Look at the far left of this chart and you see that communication-services stocks led in profit growth in the second quarter of 2025. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) are both titans of that sector, and both have invested billions in AI. They’ve largely done it by buying chips and other hardware, as well as software, from IT firms like NVIDIA (NVDA). That pop in communication-services earnings proves that these companies are profiting from AI. Similarly, the second-highest earnings gains in the chart above, in IT, confirms that AI actually does make money for Big Tech. When it comes to high-yielding, tech-focused CEFs, there are basically four tickers that income investors look to. Let’s check in on those now. As you can see in the chart below, all four of these funds’ net asset values have been roaring higher, with the 12.3%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in green, leading by a small amount over the last three months. It’s followed closely by its sister fund, the 7.7%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple. The BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), with its huge 13% yield (in blue), and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK), (in orange and paying 6%) bring up the rear. The interesting thing, however, is the fact that these funds still trade at discounts to net asset value (NAV). The best values are the three BlackRock funds (again in green, blue and purple): We’ve seen BSTZ’s discount remain basically where it was three months ago, despite its strong NAV return in that time, while BST’s discount has widened slightly, despite its strong performance. The third BlackRock tech CEF, the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), has seen its discount narrow slightly (April was a great time to buy BTX). The Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is the priciest of our quartet, but context matters here, as its premium to NAV, which it has held for much of the last decade, suddenly disappeared. Let’s stick with STK for a bit. Despite that fund’s smaller discount, is it still worth our time? I’d say yes, given the next chart. But there is a caveat that we’ll get into shortly. Before we get to that, we see that STK, whose NAV (in purple above) has closely matched the NASDAQ 100 (whose benchmark index fund is shown in orange) over the last decade. That makes STK a good way to get tech exposure, plus the index’s diversification. I mention that diversification because STK is tech-heavy, with core names like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA and Apple (AAPL). But like the NASDAQ, it also branches out a bit, with holdings in companies like Visa (V) and Bloom Energy (BE), which focuses on products that help customers generate power on-site. On the dividend side, STK’s 6% yield far outruns the NASDAQ’s 0.5%, and the CEF has also never cut its payouts. However, STK is contending with funds yielding a lot more—up to 13% in the case of the highest-paying BlackRock fund, BTX. That’s the real reason for STK’s growing discount: Even though it was swept up in the tech rally, its lower payouts aren’t enough for many income investors, now that there’s more competition, plus dividends that nearly double STK’s 6% yield, among tech CEFs. This is why the bigger discounts offered by the BlackRock funds are the better deals here, and why STK’s discount isn’t yet big enough to warrant our attention.

Title: Panama says it could take over ports as it threatens to upend $20B deal with BlackRock, MSC
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/business/panama-says-state-could-take-over-ports-as-it-threatens-to-upend-20b-deal-with-blackrock-msc/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T20:47:24Z
Full Content:
Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday the Central American nation could potentially take over two key ports along the canal — a move that would scupper US asset manager BlackRock’s bid to gain control of the vital shipping lane. Mulino asked the nation’s top court to scrap a contract with current operator CK Hutchison, which would then allow Panama to forge its own public-private partnerships for the two ports. CK Hutchison has agreed to a $20 billion deal to hand over more than 40 global ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company. CK Hutchison owns a 90% stake in Panama Ports Company, which has given it control over the Balboa and Cristobal ports located at both ends of the canal. It renewed that agreement – planned to last 25 years – in 2021, but has since proposed a sale of the ports to appease President Trump’s demands for the US to “take back” the waterway, citing national security concerns. While Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run business MSC is slated to be the lead investor, the two Panama ports included in the deal will go to BlackRock, according to Bloomberg. Panama’s Comptroller General’s office filed two lawsuits this week asking the Supreme Court to declare the sale unconstitutional and to nullify its contract with CK Hutchison, claiming the operator did not follow required steps – like getting it greenlit by the comptroller. “I do not at the moment see the continuation of the Panama Ports contract, amended or not,” Mulino said at a press conference Thursday. “We will wait for the verdict,” Mulino added on the lawsuits. MSC, CK Hutchison and the White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. It’s not the first time Panama’s comptroller has taken aim at its contract with CK Hutchison, arguing that there were irregularities from the previous government and that the deal has brought insufficient revenue to Panama. The results of a recent audit by the comptroller’s office have not been released. Every morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here! China has also pushed back hard against the BlackRock deal, fearful of losing critical access to the Panama Canal. Beijing officials have threatened to squash the sale unless Cosco, China’s largest shipping firm, gets a stake equal to those of BlackRock and MSC, according to the Wall Street Journal. Tensions have continued to heat up as China and the US negotiate on a trade deal. Panama’s government said state partnerships could also solve the problem of a key copper mine previously operated by Canada’s First Quantum Minerals, whose contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023. “The idea is still a draft, covering the ports and the mine through partnerships with the state,” Mulino said.

Title: Coinbase Stock Slides After Q2 Sales Miss Estimates

Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) slid late Thursday after the crypto exchange reported second-quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates. Coinbase reported revenue of $1.49 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $512 million. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha anticipated $1.56 billion in revenue and adjusted EBITDA of about $564 million. Revenue from transactions as well as subscriptions and services were down quarter-over-quarter, though the latter, at $656 million, was within the range Coinbase previously forecast at $600 million to $680 million. The stock was recently down about 4% in late trading after finishing the regular session essentially unchanged. Lower trading volume dragged on transaction revenue, as it did in the first. A March increase in stablecoin pair trade fees weighed on trading volume, a company representative told Investopedia. However, Coinbase sees July transaction revenue of roughly $360 million; if that pace keeps up through the next couple months, third-quarter results should be better. The company also expects subscriptions and services to rise, driven primarily by higher average crypto prices and stablecoin revenue. Its partnership with Circle should help with stablecoin USDC usage ticking up. Coinbase has been pulling on growth levers all year, making acquisitions and inking partnership deals with big firms in the financial industry. It acquired crypto options exchange Deribit in May, and earlier this month acquired token management shop Liquifi. It partnered with American Express (AXP) for a bitcoin-rewards credit card in June. And recently, it joined forces with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to offer customers another way to link their bank accounts to the exchange. Coinbase shares are up nearly 50% year-to-date. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect added information and new share-price movement.

Title: Amazon's Earnings Topped Wall Street's Estimates. The Stock Is Falling.

Amazon (AMZN) shares tumbled in extended trading Thursday, despite better-than-projected earnings and growth in its Amazon Web Services. Investors may have been looking for more in the wake of Microsoft's blowout results. Amazon posted second-quarter revenue of $167.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. The e-commerce and cloud services giant's net income of $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per share, compared to $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier, topping Wall Street’s estimates. Online store sales grew 11% to $61.49 billion, while revenue from Amazon Web Services revenue increased 18% to $30.9 billion, also above projections. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead," CEO Andy Jassy said. However, investors may have wanted more from the cloud services giant after strong results from Microsoft's Azure yesterday. Jefferies analysts said in a note Thursday that AWS growth was "disappointing given big momentum at Azure and GCP." Looking ahead, Amazon forecast third-quarter revenue of $174 billion to $179.5 billion, above the $173.17 billion analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha called for. Its outlook for operating income between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion was slightly ahead of the analyst consensus at the midpoint. Shares of Amazon dropped over 7% in after-hours trading. The stock was up 7% for 2025 through Thursday's close. This article has been updated since it was first published to include additional information and reflect more recent share price values.

Title: Dollar rises while global stock index falls; inflation and tariffs in focus

Business FILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration taken May 4, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo NEW YORK/LONDON :The U.S. dollar index rose on Thursday while MSCI's global equities gauge fell as stronger-than-expected megacap earnings reports were balanced against signs of rising inflation and investor anxiousness ahead of President Donald Trump's deadline for trade agreements. Trump gave Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs to negotiate a broader trade deal but was expected to issue higher final duty rates for most other countries as the clock wound down on the Friday deadline. Earlier in the day, an economic data release showed U.S. inflation increased in June as tariffs on imports started raising the cost of some goods, supporting economists' expectations that price pressures would pick up in the second half of the year. Thursday's data also showed fewer-than-expected Americans applied for unemployment benefits, while second-quarter U.S. labor costs increased slightly more than expected on a pick-up in wage growth.

Loading The Federal Reserve kept rates steady on Wednesday, and Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed to wait for more data before deciding whether to adjust rates in September, sending equities lower on the day and drawing further criticism from Trump.Indexes saw some support earlier on Thursday from better-than-expected results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms but by the end of the day, gains had evaporated. With the economic data appearing to support the Fed's more hawkish stance and an anxious wait for Friday's payroll report along with Trump's tariff deadline, investors had an awful lot to handle this week, said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Schwab. "This is one of those weeks where it's almost too much information to digest, so the market is ignoring it all and staying in a tight range," Gordon said. However, he noted megacap strength was countering weakness elsewhere in the market including in small-cap companies, which have less latitude to cope with higher prices."You really only have communications services and parts of technology that are holding you up today. Breadth is generally pretty weak," the strategist said. The Russell 2000 small cap index ended down 0.93 per cent while the S&P 600 small cap index fell 1.17 per cent.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 330.30 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 44,130.98 and the S&P 500 was down 23.51 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 6,339.39 with only two of its 11 major industry sectors showing gains for the day.The Nasdaq Composite fell 7.23 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 21,122.45. For the month, the S&P 500 gained 2.17 per cent and the Nasdaq rose 3.7 per cent, while the Dow added 0.08 per cent.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 5.31 points, or 0.57 per cent, to 929.02.Earlier, the pan-European STOXX 600 index finished down 0.75 per cent, at a more than one-week low. European investors were disappointed by corporate earnings reports from the likes of Sanofi and Ferrari, while beverage makers slid as they were faced with a 15 per cent U.S. tariff. US DOLLAR EYES MONTHLY GAINIn currencies, the U.S. dollar was eyeing its first monthly gain for 2025 against major currencies, underpinned by hopes for clarity on trade policy and U.S. economic resilience.For the day, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.26 per cent to 100.05.The euro was up 0.08 per cent at $1.1413 and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.23 per cent versus the dollar at 18.854. But against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.84 per cent to 150.76 after the Bank of Japan held interest rates steady and increased its inflation forecast.The Korean won weakened 0.21 per cent against the dollar after Trump's announcement that the U.S. would charge a 15 per cent tariff on imports from South Korea, which would in return invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. In U.S. Treasuries, longer-dated yields were lower before the anticipated July jobs report, reversing an increase on Wednesday following Powell's comment.The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 0.6 basis points to 4.372 per cent, from 4.378 per cent late on Wednesday, while the 30-year bond yield fell 1.5 basis points to 4.8979 per cent.But the 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, rose 2 basis points to 3.957 per cent, from 3.937 per cent late on Wednesday.In oil markets, prices fell 1 per cent after rising in each of the prior three sessions as investors considered the extension of an existing trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico and a surprise build in U.S. crude stocks put pressure on prices.U.S. crude settled down 1.06 per cent, or 74 cents at $69.26 a barrel while Brent settled at $72.53 per barrel, down 0.97 per cent, or 71 cents on the day.Gold prices rose as traders turned to the safe-haven asset on tariff uncertainty. Spot gold rose 0.51 per cent to $3,291.55 an ounce. The Federal Reserve kept rates steady on Wednesday, and Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed to wait for more data before deciding whether to adjust rates in September, sending equities lower on the day and drawing further criticism from Trump. Indexes saw some support earlier on Thursday from better-than-expected results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms but by the end of the day, gains had evaporated. With the economic data appearing to support the Fed's more hawkish stance and an anxious wait for Friday's payroll report along with Trump's tariff deadline, investors had an awful lot to handle this week, said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Schwab. "This is one of those weeks where it's almost too much information to digest, so the market is ignoring it all and staying in a tight range," Gordon said. However, he noted megacap strength was countering weakness elsewhere in the market including in small-cap companies, which have less latitude to cope with higher prices. "You really only have communications services and parts of technology that are holding you up today. Breadth is generally pretty weak," the strategist said. The Russell 2000 small cap index ended down 0.93 per cent while the S&P 600 small cap index fell 1.17 per cent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 330.30 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 44,130.98 and the S&P 500 was down 23.51 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 6,339.39 with only two of its 11 major industry sectors showing gains for the day. The Nasdaq Composite fell 7.23 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 21,122.45. For the month, the S&P 500 gained 2.17 per cent and the Nasdaq rose 3.7 per cent, while the Dow added 0.08 per cent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 5.31 points, or 0.57 per cent, to 929.02. Earlier, the pan-European STOXX 600 index finished down 0.75 per cent, at a more than one-week low. European investors were disappointed by corporate earnings reports from the likes of Sanofi and Ferrari, while beverage makers slid as they were faced with a 15 per cent U.S. tariff. US DOLLAR EYES MONTHLY GAIN In currencies, the U.S. dollar was eyeing its first monthly gain for 2025 against major currencies, underpinned by hopes for clarity on trade policy and U.S. economic resilience. For the day, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.26 per cent to 100.05. The euro was up 0.08 per cent at $1.1413 and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.23 per cent versus the dollar at 18.854. But against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.84 per cent to 150.76 after the Bank of Japan held interest rates steady and increased its inflation forecast. The Korean won weakened 0.21 per cent against the dollar after Trump's announcement that the U.S. would charge a 15 per cent tariff on imports from South Korea, which would in return invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. In U.S. Treasuries, longer-dated yields were lower before the anticipated July jobs report, reversing an increase on Wednesday following Powell's comment. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 0.6 basis points to 4.372 per cent, from 4.378 per cent late on Wednesday, while the 30-year bond yield fell 1.5 basis points to 4.8979 per cent. But the 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, rose 2 basis points to 3.957 per cent, from 3.937 per cent late on Wednesday. In oil markets, prices fell 1 per cent after rising in each of the prior three sessions as investors considered the extension of an existing trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico and a surprise build in U.S. crude stocks put pressure on prices. U.S. crude settled down 1.06 per cent, or 74 cents at $69.26 a barrel while Brent settled at $72.53 per barrel, down 0.97 per cent, or 71 cents on the day.

Title: Microsoft reaches $4 trillion market cap, three weeks after Nvidia

A few weeks ago, Nvidia became the first company in the world to reach the coveted $4 trillion market capitalization. This was on the back of a strong quarter where it raked in $44.1 billion, fueled by the strong demand for its AI-optimized hardware. Now, Microsoft has a similar story to tell following its latest fiscal quarter reports from yesterday. After informing investors and the public that it earned $76.4 billion in FY25 Q4, resulting in a net income of an eye-watering $27.2 billion, Microsoft's stock price has jumped by roughly 5%, which means that it has crossed the $4 trillion market cap. It is only the second company to reach this mark as others are quite a ways off. Apple stands strong at $3.1 trillion, Google's parent company Alphabet is at $2.3 trillion, and Meta is about to hit the $2 trillion-mark. It's not entirely surprising that Microsoft managed to reach this market cap so soon after its latest fiscal report. The company's reason for soaring market value is the same as Nvidia: AI and the cloud. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella credited the firm's investments in the cloud and AI, also noting that Azure passed $75 billion in annual revenue. Other categories like Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing grew too. Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood also had the following to say: We closed out the fiscal year with a strong quarter, highlighted by Microsoft Cloud revenue reaching $46.7 billion, up 27% (up 25% in constant currency) year-over-year. While Microsoft celebrates reaching this milestone, it is also worth highlighting that the company recently laid off 9,000 employees despite enjoying a particularly strong quarter. Satya Nadella noted shortly after that the decision weighs heavily on him, but unfortunately, this is the "enigma of success". Whatever that means.

Title: Panama Brings 'Abusive' Ports Contract with China-Linked Company to Supreme Court
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2025/07/31/panama-brings-abusive-ports-contract-china-linked-company-supreme-court/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T19:12:04Z
Full Content:
Comptroller General of Panama Anel Flores filed two separate lawsuits on Wednesday against a contract between the country and Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, over the “abusive” contract that grants PPC control of two ports at the Panama Canal. The lawsuits, filed at Panama’s Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ), demand that the decades-old contract be rendered null and void over the “many irregularities” that his office found in detriment of national interests during a months-long audit of the company and its management of the two ports. “The duty of this Comptroller’s Office is to defend the money of Panamanians and always be on the side of the best national interest,” Flores said during a press conference presenting the lawsuits on Wednesday. “That is why today we are referring directly to the Supreme Court, appealing to them as the Panamanian State and as comptroller in these two lawsuits. We hope they will be admitted promptly and that we will have the results that the country obviously needs and that the citizens are waiting for.” Since 1997, PPC, a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings, has administered two ports located at opposite ends of the Panama Canal. One of the ports is located at the Pacific entrance to the canal in Balboa and the other on the Atlantic side of the trade route in Cristóbal, in the province of Colón. At the time, the administration of former Panamanian President Ernesto Pérez Balladares granted a 25-year lease to PPC for the management and administration of the two ports. The original 1997 contract reportedly contained automatic lease renewal provisions invoked in 2021 to grant PPC an additional 25-year lease period that will run through 2047. Flores, who took office in 2024, claimed in April that the renewal did not have the endorsement of the Office of the Comptroller General, refuting statements issued by his predecessor Gerardo Solís, who claimed otherwise. The two ports have been at the center of an ongoing debate started by President Donald Trump last year after he called for the United States to regain control of the Panama Canal — which the United States originally built and ceded to Panama in 1999. President Trump and several members of his administration have denounced China’s alleged growing influence in the country and control of the interoceanic trade route. International outlets have described PPC’s parent company, HK-based Hutchison Port Holdings, as an “example” of China’s presence in the trade route after the Chinese communist regime ended the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in 2020 that prevented Beijing from imposing communist laws in Hong Kong through a “national security” law intended to suppress democratic protests. The law effectively outlawed anti-communist dissent and imposed Beijing’s law, which gives the Party total control over supposedly “private” businesses. The Office of Panama’s Comptroller General has audited PPC during the past year over its management of the two ports. The audit reportedly revealed evidence of multiple breaches of contract that amounted to more than $300 million in losses to Panamanian state coffers. At the time, Comptroller Flores accused Panama’s Maritime Authority (AMP) of misrepresenting financial figures related to PPC and its management of the ports. Flores stressed during his press conference that Panama’s relationship with PPC has been “harmful” and his office seeks to correct the “historical damage” caused to the Central American nation. The comptroller general said he hopes that the nation’s Supreme Court promptly admits both lawsuits and that the judicial process yields results that “respond to the public outcry.” “We Panamanians do not agree with or approve of what the country has been through,” Flores reportedly said. Flores denounced this year that, despite the growth in container traffic in the country, the economic benefits for Panama resulting from the PPC lease deal have been “minimal” and described the situation as a “colonial enclave that perpetuates economic inequalities.” In February, Panama’s Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez deemed the PPC contract “unconstitutional,” arguing that its terms stood in violation of fundamental principles of Panama’s constitution. At press time, Hutchison Port Holdings’ parent company CK Hutchison Holding is undergoing negotiations with asset manager Blackrock and other companies over the sale of the two ports as part of a broader sale of 43 ports spread across 23 countries. Panamanian President José Raul Mulino expressed his support for Comptroller General Flores’ legal action in remarks given during a press conference Thursday morning. Mulino denounced the contract, its 2021 renewal, and how much it has “cost” the country. “The Comptroller’s lawsuit, which I fully support, is well justified. We have all seen what that contract has cost the Panamanian nation over time. What we have not gained from it, apart from the fact that we are 10-percent shareholders, is a very, very paltry sum,” Mulino said. “When that contract was renewed for another 25 years, the Comptroller did not endorse it,” he continued, “and that is what is being challenged in court, the nullity of the contract because it was not endorsed as all contracts between the State and any third party must be endorsed.” On the subject of C.K. Hutchinson’s sale of the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, Mulino said that the negotiation “is at a standstill as far as we know.” “Remember that this is a broad process. There are 41 ports around the world that are being sold, and the two ports in Panama are in a separate process. So one thing has nothing to do with the other,” Mulino said. “The Republic of Panama will definitely adopt a port policy which we will announce in due course with the aim of enforcing what I mentioned about the canal,” he continued, “a coherent maritime and logistics strategy for the Panamanian state, in all its services, civil servants, etcetera, so that we can truly take advantage of the privilege of our strategic geographical position.” Christian K.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun PANAMA CITY, July 31 (Reuters) – Public-private partnerships could take over two key ports near the Panama Canal if courts invalidate a contract with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison‘s to operate them, Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said on Thursday. CK Hutchison holds a 90% stake in the local Panama Ports Company, which had a 25-year concession to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports, located at both ends of the canal, renewed in 2021. The contract has been at the center of a dispute since U.S. President Donald Trump this year threatened to take over the waterway due to China’s influence over Panama’s maritime industry. CK Hutchison is trying to sell its stake in the Panamanian company as part of a massive global deal. Two suits were filed with the Supreme Court this week by Panama’s Comptroller General’s office, aiming to declare the agreement unconstitutional and to nullify the contract on the basis the renewal did not follow required legal steps, including the Comptroller’s greenlight. “I do not at the moment see the continuation of the Panama Ports contract, amended or not,” Mulino told a press conference. “We will wait for the verdict,” Mulino added, referring to the lawsuits. The comptroller has openly criticized the contract over alleged irregularities by the previous government and insufficient revenue to Panama from the deal, but the full results of a recent audit by his office have not been revealed. The legal challenges the contract is facing in Panama are adding troubles to a diplomatically sensitive plan from a consortium led by U.S. asset manager BlackRock BLK.N to buy a large portion of CK Hutchison’s global ports business, a possible deal that has been celebrated by Washington but criticized in China. The deal has become increasingly politicized amid a U.S.-China trade war. Beijing argues it has significant national interests in the transaction and the proposed deal would be a betrayal of the country. Panama’s government is also seeing partnerships with the state as a solution for the operation of a key copper mine previously operated by Canada’s First Quantum Minerals FM.TO, whose contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023. “The idea is still a draft, covering the ports and the mine through partnerships with the state,” Mulino said.

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors digested a wave of corporate earnings reports and economic data. The market is now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s policy statement expected on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.46%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined 0.30% and 0.38%, respectively. Shares of UnitedHealth dropped after the company forecasted annual profits below expectations. This impacted the broader healthcare sector. Whirlpool also experienced a significant decline, plunging after missing second-quarter earnings estimates and trimming its full-year profit outlook. UPS was another notable laggard, contributing to the decline in the Dow Transports index. In contrast, VF Corp experienced a surge in its stock price, rising about 13% in premarket trading. The company beat first-quarter revenue estimates, attributing this to increased demand for its apparel and footwear products. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange reacted to the mixed bag of earnings reports. They are bracing for further guidance from the Federal Reserve. The Fed kicked off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday alongside a busy slate of economic data. While the Fed is expected to hold rates steady, investors remain on edge for any signs of economic weakness that could justify cuts later this year. Job openings and hirings both fell in June, setting the stage for the all-important monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. Meanwhile, consumer confidence saw an uptick in July, but worries about job availability intensified, according to official figures. Big Tech earnings are in full swing this week, with Meta and Microsoft set to report after the bell on Wednesday. Apple and Amazon are due on Thursday. According to Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy Venu Krishna, Big Tech has been the lone major market cohort this year that’s had earnings growth outperform its actual price return. Krishna argues this supports Big Tech’s lofty valuations and is a key reason to remain bullish on the sector. Investors remain cautious as they await more corporate earnings reports and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision. The stock market’s trajectory will likely be influenced by these factors in the coming days.

ByTy Roush ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg overtook Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to become the world’s third-wealthiest person Thursday, as Meta’s stock surged in the wake of yet another earnings beat for the firm. Zuckerberg’s net worth jumped nearly 12% to $268.4 billion Thursday, an increase of about $28.4 billion, as Meta’s share price rallied more than 11%, pacing what would be the stock’s second-largest increase on the year. Zuckerberg, who holds a 13% stake in Meta, surpassed Amazon chairman Bezos ($247.4 billion) to become the third-richest person in the world, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list, even as about $4.5 billion was added to Bezos’ net worth as Amazon shares jumped nearly 2%. Elon Musk remains the world’s richest person by far with a fortune valued at $403.5 billion as of Thursday, followed by Oracle chairman Larry Ellison ($306 billion) in second. 40%. That’s how much Meta’s share price has increased since falling to its lowest point this year in April. A surge in Meta’s share price and Zuckerberg’s fortune comes a day after the company reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that came well above projections. Meta reported $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 earnings per share, an annual increase of 22% and 38%, respectively, as the firm reported its 10th-straight quarter with a profit beat and its 12th straight for topping revenue estimates. Many investors focused on the company’s increased spending on artificial intelligence in recent months, as Meta announced an uptick in capital expenditures while it "aggressively [pursues] opportunities” related to its “artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.” Microsoft on Thursday became the second company to reach a market valuation of $4 trillion, joining Nvidia, as shares rose about 4%. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who holds a roughly 3% stake in the company, added about $4.9 billion to his net worth ($149 billion) during the company’s latest rally. Ballmer is the eighth-richest person in the world, according to our latest estimates, directly behind Google’s Sergey Brin ($151.5 billion) and right ahead of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault ($142.9 billion).

Title: July 2025 in Review

Full Content:
The Site WordPress.com hasn’t changed up anything dramatically this month. Nothing here to get angry about. They have still broken things however, so there is still some minor disappointment. Back in January I mentioned that WP.com had introduced Activity Pub integration, which let you connect your blog directly with the Fediverse, so that it would appear on, allow people to follow it, and auto update for users of services such as Mastodon. Pretty cool. You could even leave a comment on the blog from Mastodon, which was honestly easier than trying to leave a comment here without logging into a WP.com account. I had a couple of problems with it on this blog, and turned it off in March as it was causing problems with Discord. But I let it run with my other blog, EVE Online Pictures, because its format was quite well suited to the integration. And so it appeared in the Fediverse. EVE Online Pictures – Fediverse Version Granted, nobody actually followed it, which is about par for the course for the 17 years that blog has existed. There is no broad interest in EVE Online screen shots. It would get a like now and then… but even that seemed to dry up in June. And then I discovered that WP.com broke the whole Activity Pub thing, so the likes stopped because the integration stopped working after June 11, 2025. This corresponded with an update to the blog settings for WP.com hosted blogs and there does not seem to be any way to get the integration running again. I cannot even turn it off and back on again, the most basic of trouble shooting, because the on/off option has gone missing. One Year Ago There was the end of the Steam Summer sale, which always prompts me to summarize my gaming so far in the year. There was also Pokemon Go Fest 2024. My wife and I also made it to level 46 in the game. Enad Global 7 bought the struggling title Palia and assigned it to Daybreak. Meanwhile, the EQ and EQII producer’s letters gave hints about their fall plans. Playable Worlds, having announced Stars Reach, put the game up to wishlist on Steam and got on all the usual social media sites. Then there was the start of the pillars posts, followed by more pillars, and then even more pillars. It was like the Acropolis. I played a bit more Tarisland. In EVE Online the Guristas took over the Alliance Tournament XX sponsorship. The AIR daily goals got a change up while CCP made it clear that the “farms and fields” idea for null sec was over. There would, once again, be good space and bad space in null sec. This got Asher to write an open letter to CCP about their plans, which got endorsements even from our traditional foes. I did a Friday bullet points post about CCP announcements around Equinox, Vanguard, Carbon, ATXX timeline updates, and actually getting mentioned in the Community Beats post. Meanwhile I was still on about shuttle destruction in the MER and CCP introduced the weekly 15K skill point injector for Omega accounts. The latter gets you an extra 780K skill points a year if you remember to redeem them. I also sold a SKIN on the Paragon Hub. In game we were out in the Dronelands shooting the new Skyhooks. While out there I narrowly averted disaster when I jumped to the Fraternity staging beacon. Then the invasion of far Catch began in what was the start of the Imperium’s plan to move eastward. PanFam and Fraternity didn’t seem concerned even as we dropped a Keepstar on grid with one of their in U-QVWD. With Cataclysm Classic we bowled over Blackrock Caverns in our second try. Then, because we missed a quest, we went back and did it again as a foursome. Along the way an alt hit level cap. Over in retail, the pre-patch for The War Within landed. There was also the World of Racetrack vision of WoW. In Valheim I made it to the Ashlands, mostly out of my grudge against it. Having gotten there and tested it out I was done. I started back in No Man’s Sky. You start out in trouble and then work up from there. There was the warm up to Blaugust 2024. Finally, WP.com was being awful, because that is what they do best. Five Years Ago The 2020 Steam Summer Sale finished up. I bought some things. In TorilMUD, aging was abolished. And a good thing too! SSG was compensating people for outages in Lord of the Rings Online. Minecraft gave us the Nether Update. I went out and found a crimson forest in the nether. I was reflecting on Diablo II at its twenty year anniversary. We didn’t know for sure there would be a remaster at that point. Blizzard was getting us more details about the Shadowlands beta and launch. In WoW Classic the instance group was finishing up Zul’Farrak and then meandering about Maraudon, which we finished up on our second run. Blizzard was banning botters in classic while getting ready to open up the Ahn’Qiraj war effort event. As part of the anti-botting effort they were limiting the number of instances players could spawn in a day, but we were at least getting some extra bag slots. CCP cancelled their San Diego player event as Covid did not look to be going away any time soon. I also resigned myself to the fact that, despite past promises, CCP was going to keep selling skill points in EVE Online. (I’d feel better if they stopped being so dumb about it.) In game we saw the launch of the Zenith Quadrant, the first part of which was a small update to command ships, and official support for the capsuleer cemetery at Molea. The June MER showed that mining was shifting to high sec after the resource changes. But the bulk of my posts in July were about the opening of World War Bee, which I chose to list out rather than try to create a paragraph narrative: It was kind of a big deal at the time. Ten Years Ago I was feeling a bit of the summertime MMO ennui blues. Windows 10 launched, bringing with it the Microsoft Solitaire Collection. This wasn’t your Win 3.1 Solitaire or Freecell, and more is the pity. Project: Gorgon was off with another Kickstarter campaign. Would the third time be a charm? (Spoiler: yes) Need for Speed: World shut down, so I said farewell to Palmont. Derek Smart began what would become is crusade against Star Citizen, detailing why he felt we would never see the game that was promised. It could have ended there, but RSI responded in a way guaranteed to turn it into a fight and took away his Rear Admiralty. Game on! In Minecraft I was learning about not falling off of things, bringing light to dark places, and accumulating materials. Also, sheep stole my mine cart. I was mucking around in War Thunder for a bit. It is a pain to return to the game because there is always a huge update required. Over at Daybreak, there was a vote up for the EverQuest progression server Ragefire about speeding up the unlock of Ruins of Kunark, as well as talk about raids and such. On the EverQuest II side of the house, there was a beta for its first nostalgia servers. I avoided the beta but was there when the servers went live… for the big surprise, the return of the Isle of Refuge, adding to the nostalgia experience. And while that was going on, it appeared to be the end of Smed at Daybreak. In New Eden my alliance, TNT, handed over its last system in Deklein. We then lived in Tribute. The Aegis expansion hit… but there was a delay between that and other bits of what we now call Fozzie sov to be deployed. But entosis link modules were finally able to take sov as the month rolled along. So we started to learn by doing. There was a plan in the Imperium to bring in care bears to mine and rat in order to raise ADMs so that our now much reduced space holdings would remain secure. At one point Mordus Angels managed to claim some sovereignty in Pure Blind! Can you imagine? Crazy times! Meanwhile, in the cash shop… erm… New Eden store, more skins were being rolled out. Or, rather, the same skin on more ships. The blog banter of the month was on about attributes, and I was bitching about never having enough jump clones. On the Azeroth front, Blizzard said they would be announcing the next World of Warcraft expansion… right after the Q2 quarterly report was released, which raised some suspicions in me. What would the subscription numbers look like if they felt they needed a big announcement to distract from them? And I finally got my copy of Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls from the Kickstarter… only two years late. Fifteen Years Ago The late Paul the octopus created the then largest page view day ever in the history of the blog, later to be surpassed by Cats playing Patty Cake and Alamo. Actually writing about games is never popular. I was told I write like Cory Doctorow… or maybe Ian Flemming. My daughter was Banned from Club Penguin. Tears were shed, lessons were learned. EverQuest II Extended, the free to play EverQuest II, was announced. I wondered whether trying to play it without paying at all would be a challenge in and of itself. Meanwhile, there was some evidence that EQII accounts had value. That stunning news no doubt got them going on the authenticator they announced at Fan Faire this year. I completed 100 levels in The Agency: Covert Ops. I was unemployed, what can I say? StarCraft II launched. I never bought a copy and the base edition eventually went free. It never surpassed the original in popularity and Blizz eventually just stopped doing content for it, though like many old Blizz titles, it does get a patch once in a while to keep it playable. Need for Speed World, an MMO version of the Need for Speed series, launched. I ended up playing it for a bit. But, being an EA MMO, it was doomed to be shut down. In EVE Online Hulkageddon III ended, and it even had a video wrap-up. And then PLEX was made transportable in space. I wonder if they waited for Hulkageddon to be over for that? In another Summer hiatus season, the instance group started another run at LOTRO. This time it was Bung who was out, having the dual issues of moving and having a new baby to care for. Those of us in Middle-earth hung out with old friends. That put off deciding who my main character was, by letting me roll another one! Blizzard gave up on some of their RealID plans thanks to much public kvetching. Shortly there after, the ESRB came out against Real ID as being bad for consumer security while proving they too were bad for consumer security. Blizzard revamped Parental Controls again. As much as I have griped about them, they are better than any comparable controls I have seen, even in games that offer that as a feature. World of Warcraft Magazine issue #2 showed up. Issue #4 would arrive 9 months later, which is kind of a long time for an alleged quarterly publication. Once issue #5 was finally out, the whole thing was shut down. And somebody was trying to make yet another flying car that failed to live up to our expectations. Have none of these scientists ever seen The Jetsons? Twenty Years Ago Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas gets rated adults only (AO 18+) and the company faces sanctions when the hot coffee mod unlocks a hidden mini-game that existed in the product which allow the protagonist to have sex with his girlfriends. Unlike some other infamous graphic mods, this one was not fan created content, but something the company put into the game. In EVE Online the Cold War expansion hit, bringing freighters, dreadnoughts, and player owned outposts (“Permanent” caputurable stations, not to be confused with Player Owned Starbases, the doughty POS that remains to this day) in null sec. Those stations are gone, but remembered via special faction Fortizars. Forty Years Ago The Amiga 1000, the first in the line of Commodore’s Amiga series of computers, is debuted. Launched in an era when DOS users were still working from a command prompt and Mac users could run exactly one program at a time, the Amiga brought performance, multitasking, multimedia, and high resolution graphics to the masses. Later versions of the Amiga, combined with the Video Toaster software package, would do for video production what the Macintosh and the laser printer did for desktop publishing. Forty-Five Years Ago Atari releases Missile Command to arcades, one of the iconic titles of the era. Not the first arcade title to use a trackball, but it certainly helped cement the trackball as an input device. It hasn’t been ported/copied onto as many platforms as Tertis, but it has never gone away either. Most Viewed Posts in July Search Terms of the Month what is rimworld [Oh my, where to begin?] rimworld odyssey worth it [Maybe… but you have to leave your base to play it] rimworld unable to reach parking spot [I am not sure…] why is it called rimworld [Why are you called Steve?] rimworld lossless scaling [Why would you want this?] rimworld on ipad [Maybe through Steam Link] rimworld skilled in everything to an unnatural degree [Did you win then?] Game Time by ManicTime and iOS EVE Online topped the list for July. I’ll get into that below. Also, WoW Classic is back… a bit. I mean, we had the pre-patch all month. And LOTRO… well… I did get to Mordor. I’ll always have that. Enshrouded The group has made some effort to get together and do a few things, but it is summer and people have things to do on the weekends. We did make some progress, including getting to the spire in the Albaneve Summits. We’re not ready to fight the dragon yet, but we should be able to mount an expedition to get the blast furnace once we’re all around. EVE Online I ended up playing a lot in New Eden, if “playing” is the right word. I didn’t go on a lot of ops… though there were plenty to go on… but I had plenty to do in finishing up the move, starting with filtering down all the stuff in my hangar. I had piled so much in there that I went over the item limit. So there was some inventory management time. Also some ship reassembly, including some Epithals, which are used to haul PI materials, because it was also time to get my PI back online, as the market had started to recover. And then I stuck an alt in an Ishtar and did Forsaken Hubs for a couple of days, just to earn some ISK. That is probably worth a post soon. Pokemon Go My focus for the month was largely around trying to advance some achievements to get to platinum level as that is going to be the biggest barrier. I knocked out a few, but I am still 10 shy and I am close to being done with the easy ones. Meanwhile, my wife is still level 47 because she still needs to walk 25km in a week… something she totally does, but she leaves her phone sitting on the desk or counter while doing so. Like I said, keep your phone in your pocket to get steps! RimWorld With the launch of the Odyssey update I grabbed a copy of that and went and played some RimWorld for a few days. It is still a fine answer to the question, “What do I do with six hours of free time on a Saturday afternoon/evening?” You can sit there for hours fiddling with your colonists and their base. It is also kind of amusing to see the start points for the different DLC paths pop up. But after a few days of dealing with the problems of my colonists, I decided to step back from it again. It is engaging but not entirely satisfying for me now. WoW Classic Oh, and stepping back from RimWorld might have coincided with Mists of Pandaria landing in WoW Classic. I got my Pandarian out of the tutorial and did some pet battles, but with the opening of the expansion I jumped right in… literally… you jump and parachute into the expansion as part of the opening. It has, however, been kind of slow going… though I remember that being the case back in the day as well. The Jade Forest is not the best zone in the expansion. We’ll see if I carry on, or if the group decided to take a panda vacation from Enshrouded for a bit. Coming Up Well, as I have mentioned a few times, it will be Blaugust 2025. Expect some posts to go along with that, starting tomorrow. At the back end of the month will be Gamescom, and Blizz is expected to announce a couple of things… like maybe the timeline for Midnight and when housing might become a thing in WoW. Fantasy Critic League will carry on, though my next title to launch isn’t until September. So I’ll be in last place for a while still. Otherwise, it will be the usual stuff. In EVE Online we might get a hint about the next expansion and we might be about due for another update in Enshrouded… though I suspect that will come closer to November. “And somebody was trying to make yet another flying car that failed to live up to our expectations. Have none of these scientists ever seen The Jetsons?” Worth the price of admission, right there. Thanks for the giggle!! LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

In total, Tenev referenced tokenization 11 times, while also mentioning Robinhood’s stock tokens on a handful of occasions. The digital assets, which offer synthetic exposure to private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI, were unveiled for European users in June, alongside company ambitions to build its own Ethereum layer-2 scaling network. During the hour-long broadcast, Tenev invoked tokenization within five minutes, a term used to describe the process of representing real-world assets using tokens on a blockchain. In some ways, the episode mirrored Facebook parent Meta’s pivot away from the metaverse in 2023, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg referenced artificial intelligence 20 times on an earnings broadcast. Tenev described tokenization as “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade,” saying investors will benefit from 24/7 trading, instant settlement, and self custody. Robinhood can make “all sorts of assets” accessible for users that weren’t feasible before, he said. Robinhood’s stock price has nearly tripled this year, rising 179% year-to-date to $104 on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. Despite a cooldown in crypto trading revenue, the firm posted stronger-than-expected sales and profits in the second quarter. Crypto exchanges Binance and now-defunct FTX dabbled in tokenized stock trading during the pandemic-era crypto boom, but the umbrella term faded into obscurity amid regulatory heat until BlackRock CEO Larry Fink touted tokenization as “the next generation for markets” in 2022. Now, with the SEC committed to advancing tokenization frameworks under a crypto-friendly White House, Robinhood is positioning itself as a major player in the space, and one that could potentially benefit from the same regulatory tailwinds as crypto-native firms for years to come. Asked by an analyst for feedback that Robinhood is getting on tokenizing private assets, Tenev said that it’s addressed a mainstream criticism toward digital assets, namely the claim that they’re not tied to anything with "fundamental utility” and are ephemeral like memes. Aside from customers’ apparent demand for stock tokens, Tenev said the product's rollout demonstrated “the power of crypto technology and show[ed] a roadmap to what Robinhood could be if it was rebuilt from the ground up on crypto rails.” But not everyone was satisfied with Robinhood’s stock tokens, including OpenAI, which slammed the product as an unauthorized attempt to tokenize its equity. Not long after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned firms that their tokenized offerings must comply with securities laws, and a blockchain isn’t a valid way of getting around that. Tenev told Decrypt last week that he thinks the regulator’s warning was not specific to Robinhood, and on Wednesday, he noted that “some things need to happen” regulatory-wise to unlock tokenization’s true potential, including a look at investor accreditation laws. At the end of the day, Robinhood said that it’s still in the first phase of its tokenization strategy, which involves creating a sustainable supply of stock tokens. The second phase will involve getting the tokens to trade on Bitstamp, a crypto exchange that Robinhood acquired this year. Phase three, Tenev said, will allow users to plug stock tokens into decentralized finance, or DeFi protocols. DeFi applications allow users to self-custody their assets and transact natively on blockchain networks. “We have the technical capabilities to do all of this,” he said. “It's just a question of going through the regulatory process, and we think that's basically the optimal path.” Robinhood did not immediately respond to Decrypt.

Title: Circle: The Digital Dollar’s Unlikely King

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. The Infrastructure Powerhouse Built on Regulation, Compliance, and Transparency. Why the Real Battle Is Just Beginning The numbers told the story before anyone understood it. Circle's IPO wasn't just big; it was a spectacle. Priced at $35, the stock rocketed to nearly $300 within weeks, setting off a Wall Street frenzy. USDC, the world's second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle, is used wherever value moves in crypto. It is embedded across protocols, blockchains, and DeFi platforms, and is becoming the connective layer between crypto and traditional finance. Circle stands as a rare asset in modern markets: a compliant, regulated, revenue-generating gateway to a financial system being rewritten in real time. Beneath the euphoria lies a paradox: Circle earns less from USDC than the partners helping distribute it. In 2024, Coinbase received $908 million, about 54 percent of Circle's total revenue. Circle retained the remaining 46 percent. That imbalance, as one-sided as it now seems, may have been the necessary price of market share. The revenue-sharing agreements weren't a misstep. They were Circle's way in: the cost of catching up, the price of market share. Circle launched USDC in 2018, entering a market where Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, already had a four-year lead and dominated liquidity, adoption, and trading pairs across exchanges. Tether operated under an offshore model and looser compliance standards. Coming from behind, Circle played a different game, turning regulation into a competitive edge and transparency into a trust-building tool for regulators and institutions. The results validated the approach: between 2018 and 2021, USDC's supply surged more than 8,300 percent, nearly doubling Tether's growth over the same period. But there's a deeper risk: its revenue model, anchored in interest income, could unravel if rates come down materially. So why are stablecoins such a big deal? In the first half of 2025 alone, stablecoins processed $8.5 trillion in transactions. They're used in 89 percent of digital asset trades, power nearly half the liquidity in DeFi protocols managing over $200 billion, and now account for 15 percent of global retail cross-border payments. When someone buys Bitcoin on Coinbase, they're trading stablecoins, not dollars. Stablecoins slash cross-border payment costs by as much as 80 percent compared to traditional bank wires. Across Argentina, Vietnam, Turkey, and Nigeria, millions are turning to USDC for everything from groceries to rent, according to Chainalysis, which ranked these countries among the top five globally for grassroots crypto adoption in 2024. As stablecoins move into the mainstream, Circle's USDC is emerging as the default bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain economy. It's more than digital cash; it's an infrastructure layer for instant, 24/7 financial settlement. USDC spans 23 blockchains, is accepted by 89 percent of major exchanges, and reaches 500 million users across more than 180 countries through wallets and apps. In 2024 alone, its circulation jumped 78 percent to $64 billion, capturing a quarter of the global stablecoin market. Since launch, it has processed over $20 trillion in transactions, bridged $850 billion between crypto and traditional finance, and moved $20 billion through Circle's Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol. More importantly, USDC has proven its resilience under extreme stress. It survived the 2021–22 crypto winter when multiple stablecoins collapsed, maintained its peg during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis that threatened its reserve backing, and continued operating seamlessly while competitors faced regulatory scrutiny. Jamie Dimon, Wall Street's most influential banking CEO and longtime crypto skeptic, publicly acknowledged stablecoins in JPMorgan's Q2 earnings call: "We're going to be involved in both JPMorgan Depositcoin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it… The way to be cognizant is to be involved." And no stablecoin is more institutionally aligned than USDC. Circle's compliance-first strategy looks less like a hedge and more like a masterstroke. Circle's business model is deceptively simple. It earns interest on the dollars backing every USDC in circulation. With more than $60 billion worth of tokens issued, Circle holds an equal amount in reserves. About 85 percent of those reserves sit in a BlackRock-managed money market fund earning around 4 percent annually; the rest is held in cash at major banks. That interest income makes up the bulk of Circle's revenue. But the company doesn't get to keep most of it. To grow USDC's footprint, Circle signed revenue-sharing agreements with major crypto exchanges. These deals gave its partners a share of reserve income to promote and integrate USDC. The most favorable terms went to Coinbase: USDC's co-creator and largest distributor. Under the agreement, Coinbase keeps 100 percent of the interest on USDC held on its platform, which typically totals tens of billions of dollars, plus 50 percent of net reserve income from all other USDC in circulation after other partners take their share. The deal auto-renews through 2026 and could extend to 2029 if usage milestones are hit. In 2024, Coinbase earned more from USDC than Circle did. These terms made sense when market penetration was the goal—but now they leave Circle boxed in. Binance and Bybit also negotiated their own revenue-sharing deals, each securing a mid-to-high single-digit percentage of reserve income. While these cuts are smaller than Coinbase's, they still reduce Circle's overall take. In total, Circle retains only about 40 to 50 percent of net reserve income, all while bearing the full operational, compliance, and regulatory burden. And with interest rates expected to decline, the overall revenue pool is likely to shrink, tightening the squeeze just as Circle tries to scale into public markets. Circle isn't standing still. It's building new revenue streams that leverage its infrastructure: transaction fees, blockchain partnerships, and financial products with 100 percent gross margins. Blockchain partnerships monetize USDC's presence across networks. As new blockchains compete for users, hosting USDC brings instant legitimacy. Circle selectively charges integration fees for premium partners, turning network expansion into revenue. One of Circle's most effective pivots is charging fees for moving USDC between different blockchain networks. Think of it like a toll for crossing bridges between digital financial systems. Once offered for free, Circle now charges roughly 0.03 percent per transfer. With $20 billion in flows, it's become one of their fastest-growing income sources. Circle is also expanding into higher-margin financial products. Its acquisition of USYC, a digital money market fund, generates steady fee income from institutional exposure to government securities. Unlike USDC, these products carry no revenue splits. While these new revenue streams are gaining traction, Circle's long-term play is far bolder: embed USDC deep into the foundation of global finance. General payments represent a $240 trillion market where USDC's instant settlement could eliminate days-long delays and costly intermediaries. Circle envisions USDC becoming the digital backbone for everyday commerce, capturing a share of transaction fees from a market far larger than crypto trading. Cross-border payments offer the clearest near-term opportunity. Traditional wire transfers can take days, incur high fees, and pass through multiple correspondent banks. USDC can settle these transfers instantly and reduce costs by up to 80 percent. Circle's Cross-Border Payments Network is in early development, but partnerships with incumbents like FIS suggest a serious push into this space. Most ambitiously, Circle is partnering with ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, to pilot the use of USDC as collateral and settlement infrastructure for traditional financial instruments. If successful, this could dramatically accelerate settlement times, lower capital requirements for traders, and enhance market efficiency, positioning Circle to earn fees on trillions in global equity, bond, and derivatives transactions. These early initiatives show how Circle could turn its compliance-driven infrastructure into a scalable, high-margin business. Then came the regulatory watershed moment. In July 2025, the GENIUS Act swept through Congress, mandating full reserves and strict licensing for all stablecoins. Competitors scrambled to comply. Circle? It was already there—with monthly attestations, money transmitter licenses in 46 U.S. states, and years of regulatory groundwork. Overnight, its compliance burden became everyone else's nightmare—and Circle's competitive moat. Anyone can issue a stablecoin, but building trust, liquidity, and ubiquity takes years. Circle didn't just launch a token; it built the infrastructure everyone else now relies on. PayPal's PYUSD highlights the limits of closed ecosystems. Despite a massive user base, adoption has lagged due to limited utility outside its own platform. In contrast, adoption by Standard Chartered, Stripe, FIS, Visa, Mastercard, and even BlackRock reflects Circle's growing momentum. Near-zero interest rates would devastate Circle's revenue model, cutting reserve income while it surrenders 60 percent to partners. Regulatory winds could shift: a new administration might view private stablecoins as threatening dollar supremacy, or the Fed could launch its own digital currency. Most critically, if traditional finance adoption stalls, Circle's vision of embedding into global finance could remain just that: a vision. Without massive scale in traditional markets, its new revenue streams would stay subscale, leaving Circle dependent on a reserve interest model where it keeps the minority share. Now Circle is chasing the final piece of institutional legitimacy: a U.S. banking license. Its application for an FDIC charter is more than a regulatory formality; it's a strategic move to embed itself within the financial system. If approved, Circle would gain direct access to Fed payment rails, the ability to offer traditional banking services, and the trust halo of being a federally supervised institution. More importantly, it could position USDC as the safest digital dollar in circulation: government-regulated, fully reserved, and interoperable, without being state-controlled. In many ways, Circle functions like the Fed's unpaid R&D lab. Each USDC transaction is a real-time experiment in how programmable dollars might move through a modern financial system. Rather than launch a controversial FedCoin, regulators may opt to shape USDC, controlling the plumbing without owning the faucet. The application process won't be easy. Most crypto banking efforts have struggled to cross the finish line, and approval could take 18 to 24 months. But if Circle succeeds, it won't just sit on top of the financial system; it will become part of it. Circle's punishing revenue splits may reflect the cost of building foundational infrastructure. But if it executes on its trillion-dollar vision, those trade-offs could become footnotes to a much bigger success story. With regulatory tailwinds, monetization levers, and a banking charter in play, Circle is positioning for its next act. As CEO Jeremy Allaire put it, "we're still in the very early, early days of this," with stablecoins poised to scale into the trillions in circulation. The question isn't whether programmable dollars will reshape finance, but whether Circle will control the rails when they do. For investors, it's not just a fintech bet; it's a wager on who defines the future of money.

Title: Ripple CTO Explains Why XRP Ledger Lags Despite 300+ Bank Deals
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-xrp-ledger-lags-300-bank-deals/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T17:00:27Z
Full Content:
Ripple chief technology officer David “JoelKatz” Schwartz moved to explain the gap between Ripple’s oft-touted roster of bank relationships and the still-modest on-chain activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), responding at length on July 30 to a widely shared thread of questions from investor and YouTuber Andrei Jikh. In a series of posts on X, Schwartz pointed to compliance realities, institutional behavior, and product roadmap items—most notably a forthcoming “permissioned domains” model—as key reasons that institutional flows remain largely off-chain today. Jikh’s prompt captured long-standing critiques: after more than a decade and “300+ bank partnerships,” why isn’t the XRPL clearing “billions in daily on-chain volume,” why would payers choose a volatile asset like XRP over stablecoins, and—in a world saturated with fiat-linked tokens—do bridge assets still matter? He also raised questions about tokenization strategy, including why a firm such as BlackRock would select XRPL rather than operate a captive chain, and about geopolitical risk for non-US users. Schwartz’s central explanation for sluggish on-chain settlement was blunt about the constraints facing regulated entities that cannot unknowingly transact against illicit counterparties on public DEX liquidity: “Even Ripple can’t use the XRPL DEX for payments yet because we can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment. Features like permissioned domains will address this.” The post acknowledged “it has been very slow” to shift institutional flows on chain, even as he argued that institutions are “starting to see the benefits.” Pressed by another user on whether the same counterparty-risk problem exists on other L1s, Schwartz said that, depending on how features are used, “generally decentralized exchanges on public layer 1’s don’t give you any control or knowledge of who your counterparties are.” The point was procedural rather than moral—“regulations aren’t always totally logical,” he added—underscoring why regulated payment flows have struggled to route through open liquidity. Schwartz framed “permissioned domains” as a design intended to keep the ledger’s openness while giving compliance-bound participants a venue with rule-enforced counterparties. In follow-ups, he described a structure in which “retail is welcome in the permissioned parts provided they can prove they’re not sanctioned,” and said the “net effect” should be that liquidity in these domains remains comparable to the open side because of market-making between the two. On the stablecoin question, Schwartz rejected the idea that XRP’s volatility automatically disqualifies it for payments. He argued there are use cases where volatility “isn’t a minus, or is even a plus,” and—separately—contended that a functioning bridge requires inventory: “A bridge currency only works if someone is holding it so that you can get it precisely when you need it.” He added that if users don’t know which asset they will need next, they may rationally hold the “dominant bridge” because it’s cheaper to pivot from a liquid hub asset into whatever comes next. Schwartz also addressed whether bridge assets still matter if stablecoins increasingly cover most trading pairs. He allowed that “if one stablecoin wins,” it could act as the bridge, but said he doesn’t think a single stablecoin can win because each is “only…stable relative to one particular fiat currency” and anchored to jurisdictions. That multi-stablecoin reality, he argued, leaves room for a neutral bridge to connect a “long tail” of tokenized assets. Asked why a heavyweight like BlackRock wouldn’t simply build its own chain for tokenization—especially as some brokerages do—Schwartz downplayed the importance of chain homogeneity in a world of interoperability and portability. He urged skeptics to “ask the same question about Circle—why don’t they launch USDC only on their own blockchain?” implying the obvious answer: ubiquity and liquidity come from meeting users where they are, across many networks. On geopolitics, he drew a line between XRPL, which he described as neutral infrastructure, and Ripple’s enterprise products, which are segmented by jurisdiction. “If you’re asking about XRPL, it’s not really US based,” he wrote, adding that the ledger “has never discriminated against any particular participant,” and conceding that, for Ripple’s own products, licensing realities apply and some corridors—“North Korea or Cuba any time soon”—are out of bounds. Schwartz further argued that XRP’s role within Ripple’s payments stack remains material even if much of it is not visible on public ledgers. “I don’t have the numbers in front of me,” he wrote, “but I’m pretty sure XRP’s use as a bridge in Ripple Payments dwarfs every other asset.” In a related point on XRPL design, he reminded readers that “XRP has a privileged place on the XRP Ledger.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.13.

Title: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s new investor dominance is gaining momentum just as the asset consolidates in a tight range, setting the stage for a major breakout. After more than two weeks of sideways movement between $115,000 and $120,000, BTC continues to trade within this well-defined range—building pressure that typically precedes a sharp move. Data from CryptoQuant highlights a crucial dynamic: the comparison between demand and supply from new versus old investors. The current new investor dominance sits at 30%, only half of the “overheated” range of 60–70% seen during euphoric phases, but the trend is clearly climbing. This means new liquidity is entering the market steadily, while old holders are still distributing at a manageable pace. The supply of long-term holders is absorbing this growing young demand without disrupting the price structure. This healthy balance suggests that the market is still in a stable late bull phase, with no signs of mass profit-taking or capitulation from seasoned investors. With Bitcoin maintaining a bullish structure and demand from fresh entrants rising, the coming days will be critical. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared detailed insights into Bitcoin’s market structure, focusing on the balance between new and old investor behavior. According to Adler, previous peaks in new investor dominance—64% in March 2024 and 72% in December 2024—aligned precisely with local BTC price tops. At those points, new liquidity began to wane, and experienced holders ramped up profit-taking. Currently, new investor dominance stands at 30%, which is still far from those overheated extremes. However, the trend is upward. The purple fill on the chart, which reflects cumulative activity from younger coins, has been climbing steadily since July 2024. This indicates that a fresh wave of buyers continues to enter the market, while selling pressure from old hands remains limited. This dynamic creates room for further bullish continuation before the typical euphoria zone—above 60–70% dominance—takes hold. Old holders are still distributing coins, but only moderately. A coefficient of 0.3 means that three-year-old coins are absorbing demand without triggering major volatility. This balance suggests that the market remains structurally sound. Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,413, consolidating in a narrow range between $115,724 and $122,077, as seen in the 8-hour chart. This sideways movement has persisted for over two weeks, indicating indecision in the market. The key support sits at $115,724, which has been tested multiple times but held firmly, while the $122,077 level acts as immediate resistance after a strong rejection earlier in July. The price remains above the 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages, which now align in bullish order—another sign that the underlying trend is still intact despite short-term consolidation. Volume remains relatively low, suggesting that neither bulls nor bears are aggressively positioning at the moment. However, such tight ranges often precede large directional moves. If bulls manage to break above the $122K resistance with strong volume, it could trigger a continuation toward new highs. On the other hand, a breakdown below the $115.7K support would expose downside risk. Potentially leading to a retest of the 100-period moving average around $114,490 or even the 200-period average near $110,188.

Title: Pam Bondi: Who is Trump’s attorney general handling the Epstein files?

The former Florida top cop has embraced loyalty to Trump, but faces fallout from the MAGA base over Epstein files. United States Attorney General Pam Bondi has emerged as one of the most embattled top officials in the administration of United States President Donald Trump, amid fallout over her handling of disclosures related to the sex trafficking case of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has so far stood by Bondi, who has been instrumental in his reshaping of the Department of Justice, but the president has continued to voice frustration that public fixation on the scandal – and criticism from both within his base and among his opponents – has refused to die down. Democrats have adopted the issue as their latest political cudgel, while Republicans in Congress have promised to continue their own probe when they return from summer recess, with plans to hear testimony from Bondi, as well as subpoena the case files and testimony from Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. Two lawmakers are even pushing a bill that would compel Bondi to release the documents in question, a move Republican Thomas Massie has said is aimed at “justice for the victims and transparency for Americans”. So who is Bondi and how did the 59-year-old attorney general come to be one of Trump’s most loyal cabinet members? Bondi spent 18 years as a public prosecutor in Hillsborough County, Florida before breaking into statewide office. The lengthy career gave her more direct prosecutorial experience than any preceding US attorney general, according to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative group that has had an outsized role in shaping the policy of Trump’s second term. Speaking last year to the Tampa Bay Times, former colleagues recounted Bondi’s reputation for jury-turning charisma that saw her quickly rise through the ranks of felony prosecutions. But it was regular media appearances as a legal analyst on national news networks that helped her to build public recognition, which was credited with her victory in Florida’s open attorney general race in 2010. Bondi, who took office in 2011, was also buoyed by the endorsement of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. As attorney general, Bondi led crusades against so-called “pill mills”, clinics that loosely prescribe pain medications, while leading some Republican pet causes, including a multi-state effort to overturn former President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act. She also led efforts to uphold Florida’s ban on same sex marriage, before its nationwide legalisation by Supreme Court order in 2015, as well as the ability for same sex couples to adopt. During that period, Bondi sought to establish herself as a champion against sex trafficking and child sex abuse, launching the state’s council on human trafficking and an investigation into past abuse by Catholic priests. As Florida’s top cop, she also had her first brush with Epstein, with critics accusing her of remaining willfully silent on a controversial non-prosecution agreement Epstein and his co-conspirators had struck with her predecessor. They have said Bondi could have intervened as victims launched lawsuits challenging the deal, which saw Epstein plead guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution but serve only months in prison. “But Bondi kept her distance from the state’s most prominent sex-trafficking case, even as Epstein’s victims pleaded with the courts to invalidate provisions of his non-prosecution agreement and filed lawsuits alleging he abused them when he was on work release from jail,” wrote Mary Ellen Klas, a Bloomberg opinion writer and former Miami Herald Bureau Chief. “Her inaction helped to perpetuate what victims describe as a government cover-up that, along with Epstein’s death, has robbed those victims of their chance to get answers and hold their abusers to account,” she wrote. Bondi’s connections with Trump drew scrutiny even before he entered office, after it was revealed in 2016 that authorities had launched an ethics probe related to the soon-to-be president. At question was whether Bondi had solicited contributions from Trump in 2013, as her office was weighing joining a lawsuit against Trump University. Her office denied any wrongdoing, and the investigation was later dropped. Despite those early contacts, Bondi was not an early adherent to Trump’s presidential ambitions or his nascent “Make America Great Again” movement. Instead, she initially supported former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the 2016 Republican primary. When Jeb dropped out of the race, she threw her lot in with Trump. From there, things accelerated quickly. While still Florida’s attorney general, Bondi served on Trump’s first White House transition team. She left her post in Florida in 2019 and soon joined the Ballard Lobbyist group, representing the interests of Amazon, General Motors, and Uber, among others. From there, she joined the White House legal team, defending the president during his first impeachment trial in the US Senate, in which Trump was accused of conditioning weapons to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on then political opponent Biden. After Trump’s election loss, Bondi was among those spearheading unfounded claims that the vote was marred by widespread fraud. She helped coordinate former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s infamous news conference at the Four Seasons Landscaping in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she flatly and falsely claimed that Trump had “won Pennsylvania”. She went on to chair the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), a pro-Trump think tank that oversaw “a series of concerning lawsuits in recent years, particularly in the voting rights and elections arena”, as described by the Brennan Center for Justice. Publicly, she also floated prosecuting career federal law enforcement officials who investigated Trump. In criticising her appointment, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee in January said that Bondi had “the ultimate qualification” to be Trump’s attorney general: “loyalty”. That loyalty has generated much consternation since Bondi took office, with opponents accusing her of shaping the country’s top law enforcement agency in Trump’s likeness. That has included hundreds of layoffs at the department, including investigators and prosecutors in the two federal criminal cases lodged against Trump before his November election victory last year. She has also launched a task force to probe those investigations, while publicly decrying what she has framed as a conspiracy against Trump amid the career staff, saying the staff of the FBI and Justice Department were rife with employees “who despise Donald Trump, despise us”, as she told Fox News. More recently, she launched a strike force to investigate how the intelligence community, under former President Obama, handled information related to Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election, in what some have seen as an attempt to distract from the Epstein imbroglio. She has also announced a misconduct complaint against federal Judge James Boasberg, escalating a standoff over judges who have ruled against Trump’s early actions, most notably his use of the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members with little requirement for proof. But it was Bondi’s embrace of theories pushed by Trump’s staunchest supporters that has landed her in the current predicament. In February, she brazenly told Fox News that she had Epstein’s long-sought “client list” – thought to contain the names of the powerful figures the billionaire blackmailed via his sex scheme – “sitting on my desk right now”. Months later, the White House would say Bondi was referring to the entirety of Epstein’s case files, and not specifically the list long sought by MAGA’s most influential voices. That came shortly after the Justice Department in July released a memo, stating flatly: “This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list'”. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out

Time Published: 2025-07-31T16:17:54Z

Another day, another vague reference to the promise of superintelligence. On Wednesday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared a video address and accompanying letter on X stating his company's "vision for the future of personal superintelligence for everyone." Also: How Meta's new AI chatbot could strike up a conversation with you Zuckerberg coined that term -- without actually defining it -- earlier this month, when Meta announced its new Superintelligence Labs, a division within the company dedicated to building a computer system that significantly surpasses human capability. Superintelligence would leapfrog artificial general intelligence (AGI), which would be theoretically comparable to the human brain. Both remain deeply hypothetical. Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction In the letter, Zuckerberg references recent advancements in agentic AI, noting that systems are slowly but surely "improving themselves," and claims that superintelligence is more possible than ever -- something we've heard before. Still, for every advancement, there is usually a limitation. "As profound as the abundance produced by AI may one day be, an even more meaningful impact on our lives will likely come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, experience any adventure, be a better friend to those you care about, and grow to become the person you aspire to be," writes Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg's message refrains from clarifying what a personal AI product or service could be. Regardless, he is optimistic it will free the industry from the automation trap. "If trends continue, then you'd expect people to spend less time in productivity software, and more time creating and connecting," he says. It's unclear whether that trend has actually begun, though, considering how Jevon's Paradox -- the theory that efficiency only begets more consumption, not freedom -- appears to be playing out. Also: I've worn the Meta Ray-Bans for half a year, and these 5 features still amaze me "Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," his letter continues. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices." The Information reported on Monday that Meta's smart glasses sales have more than tripled in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Perhaps for good reason; ZDNET senior AI editor Sabrina Ortiz recently noted in our AI newsletter that smart glasses are, in her opinion, the most successful vehicle for effective personal AI. Amidst the optimism, Zuckerberg noted the already-present reality that AI will disrupt many parts of society, including the job market -- and that how we'll apply superintelligence remains to be seen (if or when it is realized). "The rest of this decade seems likely to be the decisive period for determining the path this technology will take, and whether superintelligence will be a tool for personal empowerment or a force focused on replacing large swaths of society," he writes. Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking Zuckerberg's vision expands on the current argument for why AI agents are useful. At their most efficient, agents take up the busywork that can claim much of a human worker's day, automating the mundane so employees can focus on higher-level, more singular contributions. That's precisely because agents are broadly less capable than humans, especially when it comes to tasks like original creative work, relationship management, negotiation, and understanding certain contexts. But the whole premise of superintelligence is that it would far exceed what the human brain can do. How Zuckerberg maintains this is possible while also assuring it would not displace people themselves will remain logically opaque until we have concrete examples. Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon This feels especially relevant in the context of work, where AI's agentic impact is unsettling job security. Microsoft just completed a third round of layoffs this year, ostensibly thanks to AI, and policy has yet to specify worker protections for those at risk of being replaced by the technology, instead favoring tax breaks for upskilling initiatives. Meta itself is in the process of laying off 5% of its workforce this year, following 21,000 total layoffs since 2022, according to Business Insider. As is the case at other companies, the layoffs are at least partially due to redirecting funds into AI development. It's unclear whether these roles at Meta will eventually also be replaced by AI. In what could be seen as a strategic investment plea, Zuckerberg assured the public that, despite offering no specifics, Meta can be trusted with the huge responsibility of shepherding whatever "personal superintelligence" is toward humanity's best interests -- unlike other AI companies. "We believe in putting this power in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives," his letter says, noting that Meta is "distinct from others in the industry who believe superintelligence should be directed centrally towards automating all valuable work, and then humanity will live on a dole of its output." "At Meta, we believe that people pursuing their individual aspirations is how we have always made progress expanding prosperity, science, health, and culture," he says. Also: Control your computer with your mind? Meta's working on that It's unclear how this approach to a still-unrealized power will fit with the company's past business decisions. In April, for example, Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams, formerly the company's director of global policy, testified that Meta shared data with advertisers about when users, including teens, felt most "worthless or helpless." While double-speak isn't surprising coming from the world's most powerful CEOs, Zuckerberg's message is a worthwhile reminder that, in their relatively brief history, tech companies have yet to commit their technology to the betterment of the human condition over profits. In carefully promising nothing but asking for the public's trust, the message leaves uncertain who Zuckerberg's idealized future is particularly for -- especially in an increasingly deregulated policy environment. Also: Trump's AI plan pushes AI upskilling instead of worker protections - and 4 other key takeaways In the meantime, the AI agents we have today support tasks like studying and exam prep, coding, turning notes into video, perfecting images, and more.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta continues to pour billions into its AI efforts, while also reporting impressive revenue and profit growth for the second quarter. Zuckerberg believes his AI research team will produce a “personal superintelligence” available to everyone. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has been investing heavily in AI in recent years. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been on a spending spree to hire top AI researchers, with the goal of building a “superintelligent” AI system. Meta’s latest quarterly results indicate that the company’s AI push is not slowing down. In its second-quarter earnings report, Meta announced that it would continue to increase its spending, particularly on the construction of data centers, which are essential for its AI initiatives. The company raised its capital expenditure forecast for the year and said that the rate of increase in its spending would jump even higher next year. Zuckerberg expressed his excitement about bringing “personal superintelligence to everyone.” Explaining, “We believe in putting this power in people’s hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives” in a statement accompanying the earnings report. The company’s financial results for the second quarter were impressive, with revenue of $47.5 billion, a 22 percent increase from the same period last year and above Wall Street estimates of $44.8 billion. Profit also grew by 36 percent to $18.3 billion, surpassing expectations of $15.1 billion. Meta’s family of apps, including Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, had 3.48 billion daily users in June, a six percent increase from a year ago.. While investors were initially skeptical of Meta’s focus on the metaverse in 2021, they have been more patient with the company’s AI investments, largely because AI has become a central focus for the entire tech industry. However, there is growing pressure on Meta’s new AI team to deliver results quickly, particularly in terms of improving the company’s core advertising business. Analysts believe that Meta’s long-term plan is to expand its AI capabilities beyond advertising, potentially developing chatbots and personal assistants that can mimic human interactions. However, in the short term, the company’s stock price will likely be influenced by how AI impacts its existing business.

Title: Comcast’s Q2 Earnings Show Streaming Momentum, But Legacy Pressures Persist

Time Published: 2025-07-31T16:00:26Z

Investors rewarded Meta on Wednesday for reporting stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings, driven by robust ad revenue growth and promising user engagement metrics. The company’s stock rose more than 11% in after-hours trading. The following morning, investors rewarded Comcast for losing fewer broadband and video subscribers than expected in Q2, with a roughly 5% bump in share price during premarket trading. It’s a study in contrasts. In all fairness, though, you can’t really compare a broadcaster’s business with a Big Tech company. Despite the growth and promise of Peacock, Comcast, which reported second quarter earnings on Thursday, is still navigating big challenges in its legacy business lines, namely ongoing declines in broadband and cable TV subscribers. Sporting chance That said, NBCU’s streaming losses were down to $100 million in Q2 from $348 million year over year, representing significant progress as the platform nears break-even. Although total advertising revenue for the media segment overall was down 7% due to tough political comparisons and the volume and timing of sports content – Q2 has historically been a seasonally light sports quarter for Comcast – Peacock’s revenue was up 18% in the second quarter to $1.2 billion. Peacock’s subscriber base also remained steady at 41 million. “Steady” is, of course, another way to say “flat.” But executives are optimistic that, once the upcoming NBA season begins in October, subscriptions will grow. NBCU signed an 11-year media rights agreement with the NBA last year that will bring the NBA to Peacock and back to NBC for the first time since the early 2000s. “The second quarter has historically lacked tentpole sports, so we’ve been more susceptible to fluctuations in general entertainment ratings,” said Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong. “We look forward to that changing next year with the launch of the NBA.” Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Playing the long game Comcast can also look forward to spending a heck of a lot of money for those NBA rights. It’s shelling out $2.45 billion per year, which will total roughly $27 billion over the course of the partnership. But it’s totally worth it, Comcast executives told investors. The NBA will give NBCU the ability to deliver sports programming throughout the year and it was also a sweetener for advertisers during upfront negotiations. Several weeks ago, NBCU announced the highest overall ad sales volume commitments in the company’s history and its largest sports commitments to date. A “big piece of that is having the NBA in there,” said Comcast President Mike Cavanagh. “That’s delivered strongly.” And, hey, Peacock didn’t even exist five years ago and now it’s on a clear path to profitability with narrowing losses. “Obviously, there are a lot of challenges in the ecosystem, but we took on the challenge and opportunity of creating a streaming service,” Cavanagh said. “Our overall media results this quarter were driven by the continued meaningful progress we’re making in our pivot to streaming.”

Title: Microsoft researchers have revealed the 40 jobs most exposed to AI—and even teachers make the list

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. As companies like Amazon publicly announce AI-driven workforce reductions, workers are scrambling to understand which careers might soon disappear and be outsourced to technology. A new report from Microsoft researchers studying the occupational implications of generative AI offers some clarity. Translators, historians, and writers are among the roles with the highest AI applicability score, meaning the job’s tasks are most closely aligned with AI’s current abilities, according to the report released this month that ranked professions. Customer service and sales representatives—which make up about 5 million jobs in the U.S.—will also have to compete with AI. Overall, the jobs most exposed are ones that involve knowledge work—like people doing computer, math, or administrative work in an office, the researchers wrote. Sales jobs are also high on the list, since they often involve sharing and explaining information. While Microsoft said high applicability doesn’t automatically mean those jobs will necessarily be replaced by AI, the list of roles quickly went viral—with professionals deeming them “most at risk.” It comes as companies like IBM have been freezing thousands of would-be new roles that it expects AI will take over in the next 5 years, and graduates in the U.K. are facing the worst job market since 2018 as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, says Indeed. Of course, there are some jobs that are unlikely to be touched by AI: Dredge operators; bridge and lock tenders; and water treatment plant and system operators are among the jobs with virtually no generative AI exposure, thanks in part to their hands-on equipment requirements. Still, business leaders like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have said that every job will be touched by AI in some way, and so it’s best to embrace it. “Every job will be affected, and immediately. It is unquestionable,” Huang said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in May. “You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Many of the jobs with high chances of getting upended by AI soon, like political scientists, journalists, and management analysts, are all ones that typically require a four-year degree to land a job. And as the researchers point out, having a degree—which was once considered a surefire path to career advancement—is no longer a safeguard against the changing tides. “In terms of education requirements, we find higher AI applicability for occupations requiring a Bachelor’s degree than occupations with lower requirements,” wrote the researchers, who studied 200,000 real-world conversations of Copilot users and cross-compared the AI’s performance with occupational data. On the flip side, there are some career paths with low AI exposure, that are growing in demand. The healthcare sector, in particular, is an area that is experiencing this heavily. The home health and personal care aid industry is expected to create the greatest number of new jobs over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor. At the same time, the researchers recognized that even their findings don’t capture the full scope of the AI revolution—and there could be further automation caused by more than just generative technology: “Our measurement is purely about LLMs: other applications of AI could certainly affect occupations involving operating and monitoring machinery, such as truck driving.” Kiran Tomlinson, a senior Microsoft researcher, tells Fortune the study focused on highlighting where AI might change how work is done, not take away or replace jobs. “Our research shows that AI supports many tasks, particularly those involving research, writing, and communication, but does not indicate it can fully perform any single occupation. As AI adoption accelerates, it’s important that we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact,” Tomlinson says. After seeing the rollercoaster of layoffs across the tech industry over the past few years, many Gen Zers have turned to seemingly steadier fields like education. The sector was the fastest-growing industry among recent U.K. graduates last year, and it was similarly a top career choice for American graduates. And while the profession can provide further work-life balance and decent benefits, the ability for AI to do the work may cause further headache. The report singles out farm and home management educators—as well as postsecondary economics, business, and library science teachers—as roles with relatively high AI applicability. While it’s unlikely that schools will roll out AI teachers en masse, the report’s findings underscore how quickly the technology could reshape the education profession—and many others.

July 31, 2025 10:58 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, July 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Less Lethal Ammunition Global Market Report 2025" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The less lethal ammunition market size has grown steadily in recent years. It will grow from $1.06 billion in 2024 to $1.11 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.3%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to civil rights movements and protests, law enforcement requirements, tactical and military operations, public pressure and advocacy, awareness of human rights.The less lethal ammunition market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years. It will grow to $1.36 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to global security concerns, urbanization and population growth, ethical and humanitarian considerations, risk mitigation strategies, international conflict resolution efforts. Major trends in the forecast period include training integration and simulation, humanitarian and peacekeeping applications, innovative safety features, enhanced effectiveness and accuracy.The forecast of 5.3% growth over the next five years indicates a slight reduction of 0.1% from the previous projection for this market. This marginal decrease is influenced by ongoing tariff-related uncertainties between the U.S. and its trade partners. This is likely to directly affect the US through tariffs on rubber bullet manufacturing equipment from Brazil and Spain, increasing costs for law enforcement agencies. The effect will also be felt more widely due to reciprocal tariffs and the negative effect on the global economy and trade due to increased trade tensions and restrictions.The rise in crime rates is anticipated to drive the growth of the less lethal ammunition market in the future. Crime encompasses unlawful activities or behaviors that are prohibited by law and subject to legal penalties, representing any actions against the established rules and regulations of a particular jurisdiction. The escalating crime rates necessitate the use of less lethal ammunition by law enforcement, offering a non-lethal option to manage and subdue potential threats while minimizing the risk of fatal injuries. For instance, in October 2023, a report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a U.S.-based law enforcement agency, indicated that in 2022, there was an estimated 1.3% increase in robbery incidents nationwide compared to the previous year. Thus, the rising incidence of crime is propelling the growth of the less lethal ammunition market moving forward.The less lethal ammunition market is experiencing growth, driven by the augmented budget allocation for the military and law enforcement sectors. Budget allocation for these sectors involves the government earmarking financial resources to fund operations, activities, and equipment. This allocation supports the expansion of less-lethal ammunition, enabling the development and deployment of advanced technologies to enhance the capabilities of security forces and address concerns related to lethal force.Training and simulation solutions have emerged as a pivotal trend in the less-lethal ammunition market, with major companies actively developing innovative products to solidify their market positions. In February 2022, RUAG Ammotec's Defense and Law Enforcement business unit (DLE), a part of the Swiss technology company RUAG Group, introduced lead-free 9x19 LF Training SX ammunition. This new product, weighing 6.1 g and 94 g, addresses the increased demand from police departments for lead-free, low-pollutant ammunition. Notably, the cartridge maintains the same point of impact and equivalent recoil as the traditional ACTION 4 cartridge due to a precisely regulated charging procedure. The introduction of training and simulation solutions in the form of lead-free ammunition exemplifies a key trend driving the less-lethal ammunition market's growth.Less lethal ammunition comprises specialized projectiles or rounds primarily designed for use by law enforcement, military, and security personnel. It serves the purpose of incapacitating or subduing individuals without causing fatal injuries, providing an intermediate level of force between verbal commands and the use of lethal firearms.The primary types of less lethal ammunition include rubber bullets, bean bag rounds, plastic bullets, and paintballs. Rubber bullets, for instance, are non-lethal ammunition specifically crafted for use in crowd control and riot situations by law enforcement or military personnel. They are intended to disperse or incapacitate individuals without causing fatal harm. Rubber bullets are compatible with various weapon types, including shotguns and launchers, and find applications in military and law enforcement scenarios.Note that the outlook for this market is being affected by rapid changes in trade relations and tariffs globally. The report will be updated prior to delivery to reflect the latest status, including revised forecasts and quantified impact analysis. The report's Recommendations and Conclusions sections will be updated to give strategies for entities dealing with the fast-moving international environment.Major players in the less-lethal ammunition market are directing their efforts towards developing innovative products, including less-lethal shotgun ammunition. Less-lethal shotgun ammunition is designed to incapacitate or deter threats without causing fatal injuries. In September 2023, Byrna Technologies, a US-based defense products manufacturer, launched Byrna LE. This handheld gun features patented pull-pierce technology and an increased shot capacity, offering a more powerful alternative. Accompanying the launcher is a fin-tailed 12-gauge shotgun shell, providing enhanced self-defense options that enable users to switch between less-lethal and standard rounds. Byrna Technologies aims to reduce gun-related casualties by promoting the use of these alternatives, citing real-world successes in preventing carjackings, thwarting muggings, and deterring home invasions. The focus on innovative shotgun products stands out as a strategy to increase profitability in the less-lethal ammunition market.North America was the largest region in the less lethal ammunition market in 2024. The regions covered in the less lethal ammunition market report are Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, Middle East, Africa. The countries covered in the less lethal ammunition market report are Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, UK, USA, Italy, Spain, Canada.Key Topics Covered: 1.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Only two companies have ever reached that size. By Eddie Makuch on July 31, 2025 at 7:52AM PDT Microsoft achieved a $4 trillion market cap, becoming just the second company ever to reach that valuation. Microsoft is now the No. 2 most valuable company on the planet, trailing only Nvidia. The climbing valuation comes just after Microsoft laid off 9,000+ people, including major cuts at Xbox. Microsoft reported earnings on Wednesday, and the company beat expectations. The company's stock price jumped after that, helping push Microsoft's total valuation above $4 trillion. The stock price has since cooled off, dropping Microsoft back below $4 trillion but still ranking No. 2 overall. Microsoft is currently trading at around $538 per share, which is up 28% year-to-date and up 163% over the past five years. The top five companies on the planet ranked by market cap include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, in that order. Microsoft brought in revenue of $76.4 billion for the quarter that ended June 30, along with a profit of $27.2 billion. For the Xbox business, Microsoft reported that annual Game Pass revenue reached nearly $5 billion for the first time, with 50 million people trying Black Ops 6. Additionally, Microsoft said Xbox had 500 million monthly active users across all platforms, covering console, PC, mobile, and more. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on an earnings call that Microsoft is the "top publisher" on both Xbox and PlayStation. Newly published US video game sales data showed that Xbox games are dominating the PlayStation sales charts. Looking ahead, Microsoft plans to invest even more in AI infrastructure and technology than before, with Microsoft upping its planned investment from $80 billion to $120 billion. Nadella acknowledged in a memo to staff that people may wonder why Microsoft is laying off thousands of people as its business thrives. He said, "This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value." For Xbox, Microsoft's cuts included not only layoffs but game cancellations and the closure of at least one studio. See the gallery below to learn more about the extent of the cuts.

Title: Vertiv Stock Up 27%. Google, Meta, Microsoft AI Spend To Drive Growth

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Vertiv's strong financial performance and raised outlook are primarily fueled by massive capital expenditures from hyperscalers like Meta and Microsoft, driven by the escalating infrastructure demands of AI data centers.The company, a key supplier of power and cooling solutions, anticipates continued rapid growth due to its competitive advantages, substantial backlog, and the increasing energy needs of advanced AI chips, despite some analyst valuation concerns. Vertiv stock is up 27% this year after posting results that beat expectations and raising the company’s forecast, according to Investor’s Business Daily. A big reason for Vertiv’s success is the ever rising capital expenditures of companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, reported the Wall Street Journal. Vertiv supplies hyperscalers hardware and services to power and cool the data centers where chatbot providers like OpenAI train and operate their AI models, according to my book Brain Rush. While Vertiv also supplies such infrastructure to other customer groups – such as communication networks and commercial and industrial facilities – AI is the source of the fastest growth, according to my July 30 interview with Vertiv CEO Gio Albertazzi. Vertiv’s future prospects look bright for two reasons: To be fair, Vertiv shares could have limited upside. How so? A survey of 15 Wall Street analysts reveals an average 12 month price target of $144 – making the stock 4% overvalued, according to TipRanks. Vertiv’s second quarter results exceeded investor expectations and the company raised its full year outlook, according to IBD. Here are the key numbers: “Vertiv’s second-quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our market position and our ability to execute at scale,” Albertazzi said in a news release. “Our 35% sales growth and robust orders momentum reflect both strong market demand and our expanded capabilities to serve our customers' increasingly complex infrastructure needs.” Vertiv’s 35% sales growth is more than three times faster than the industry’s expected rate of expansion. The company’s competitive advantages suggest the company is winning more market share. Vertiv’s total addressable market – providing hardware and services for data centers, communications, and commercial and industrial customers – amounts to $60 billion and is growing at a 9% to 11% annual rate, according to Albertazzi. The data center segment – featuring hyperscalers (such as AWS and Microsoft’s Azure cloud), neocloud providers (like CoreWeave), and data center companies like Equinix – is growing at a 15% to 17% annual rate, he added. Before July 30, when they reported expectations-beating quarterly growth, both Meta and Microsoft “were already on track to spend more than 30% of this year’s revenue on capital expenditures, compared with about 15% to 20% historically,” the Journal reported. Meta and Microsoft seem to have different plans for spending. In pursuit of “superintelligence,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is making a “massive investment,” noted the Journal – including up to $72 billion this year and $100 billion next year, noted the New York Times. Zuckerberg expects it will take years for the investment to pay off. “We do take very seriously that this is just a massive amount of capital to convert into many gigawatts of compute, which we think is going to help us produce leading research and quality products and in running the business,” he said on Meta’s earnings call. For its part, Microsoft projected record capital expenditures of $30 billion for the current quarter although the software giant “envisions slower spending growth in the year ending June 2026 than in 2025,” according to the Journal. Still, that could amount to $120 billion, the Times noted. Vertiv expects hyperscaler AI capital expenditure growth to persist. “By investing in more capacity – which gives hyperscalers an advantage – they are implicitly confirming their expectations for monetization,” Albertazzi told me. Vertiv is benefiting from using AI to grow revenue faster than fixed costs. How so? The company’s AI applications include configuring its supply chain, executing tariff countermeasures, improving the company’s overall speed and efficiency, and providing long-term value to customers, he explained. Vertiv offers a range of hardware and services. Roughly a third of the company’s revenue comes from cooling – such as liquid cooling systems about which I wrote in Brain Rush; a third from power management; and 22% from services to speed data center deployment, according to Albertazzi. Vertiv wins because of its role as an industry thought leader – which enables the company to participate in creating the future. “We are part of an industry ecosystem including silicon providers like Nvidia and hyperscalers," he said. "Our engineers work with their engineers to design data centers for the future. We also respond to requests for proposal and requests for quotation. There are transactions but also collaboration. We are in the fabric, in the loop. We have a track record throughout the life cycle.” Vertiv expects strong growth as evidenced by the following metrics from the company’s Q2 2025 investor presentation: Vertiv sees many new growth vectors as customers deploy new technologies. “Growth will come from cooling, power management, white spaces within IT, and digitization of predictive maintenance,” Albertazzi explained. “Demand for liquid cooling is in its infancy. There is growing demand for data center access to power that is grid independent. We are collaborating with Oklo to deploy small nuclear reactors – which can get into production much more quickly than traditional nuclear plants. We will provide hardware to meet the power requirements of new graphics processing units such as Nvidia’s Rubin. And we will help design and build data centers using prefabrication to reduce deployment time,” he added. GPU improvements are likely to sustain demand for Vertiv’s products and services. As Nvidia and rivals introduce new GPUs, their computational power and energy consumption rise. “A rack with the latest AI chips requires the same power as 10 to 15 racks at a conventional site,” according to the Financial Times. In January 2025, Wall Street analysts saw Vertiv’s stock as overvalued, noted my post on Forbes. Yet the stock has continued to rise. Satisfying the ever increasing power and cooling needs of AI data centers may keep propelling Vertiv’s stock ahead of investor expectations.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Michael McDonald, Shirley Zhao and Filipe Pacheco Jul 30, 2025, (Bloomberg) –Panama’s comptroller general asked its Supreme Court to review the government’s contract extension with CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s local ports unit, potentially throwing a new wrench into the conglomerate’s controversial deal to sell its global terminals business. Panamanian official Anel Flores said he asked the court to find unconstitutional a 2021 extension for Panama Ports Co.’s contract to operate two ports along the Panama Canal and declare it null and void. “The contract was bad, one-sided and abusive, against the interests of the country,” he told a briefing in Panama City, adding that the ports belong to the country and should not be negotiated over by others. Panama Ports and CK Hutchison didn’t respond to requests for comment. The development risks further complicating a transaction that’s become a high-profile tussle between the US and China. CK Hutchison shares fell 2.2% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday, dropping the most in over a month. “Panama’s legal challenge to CK Hutchison’s port concession could introduce material uncertainty and elevates the risk of delays, potentially derailing the deal or triggering a renegotiation at a lower valuation,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong said. The Panama terminals are at the center of the geopolitically delicate deal for the 43 ports owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison. A buyer consortium backed by BlackRock Inc. is seeking to acquire the business, with the American asset manager taking control of Panama Ports. “What is Panama’s business is that the ports are ours, they belong to the republic of Panama,” Flores told the briefing. “I don’t think it’s right that, at other latitudes, other people are negotiating the future using property that belongs to Panama.” Read More: How Li Ka-shing Landed in the Middle of US-China Tiff: QuickTake Still, some analysts assessed that Panama’s objection would not be a major roadblock for CK Hutchison’s deal, given that other ports in the country are operated by foreign entities. The development “appears a small-ish road bump to completing the global terminal deal,” said David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors. “There are three remaining Panamanian ports, all operated by foreigners, none of which has raised the ire of the comptroller,” he said, “implying there exist benchmark contracts that can be struck for these two ports.” Flores said in April that an audit by his office found that Panama Ports had failed to get proper approvals for its contract extension. Tax breaks under the contract have also cost the Central American nation $1.3 billion, as a series of tax-exempt shell companies operating on Panama Ports’s grounds helped the firm lower the share of profits it paid the government, he told a press conference at the time. Outside of Panama, CK Hutchison and the buyer consortium have been trying to find a solution for the transaction to move forward. While the deal has been hailed by US President Donald Trump as returning the canal to American influence, it’s been furiously opposed by Beijing, which considers BlackRock a proxy for American influence. China has also separately cautioned that antitrust reviews shouldn’t be bypassed, so as to prevent an agreement from being rushed into. “The complexity shows exactly how ports have become assets with larger geopolitical risks and why CK Hutchison wants to reduce its related business,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. CK Hutchison said this week that it may invite an unnamed “major strategic investor” from China to join the consortium, a move that’s aimed at appeasing China. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. has been negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the group, Bloomberg News reported. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

The $4 trillion club is now a party of two. Microsoft (MSFT) on Thursday became the second company in history to reach a $4 trillion market value as tech stock prices continued to climb on booming AI demand. Microsoft's stock popped 7% at the open, putting its market capitalization at $4.09 trillion, after the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter results blew past expectations on strong growth in all of its businesses, but especially in its cloud computing and AI services. Microsoft’s entry into the $4 trillion club comes just weeks after Nvidia (NVDA) became the first company to reach the milestone. Its market cap briefly crossed $4 trillion in intraday trading on July 9, but it wasn’t until July 10 that it closed above the threshold. Microsoft was already America’s second most valuable company, worth nearly $2 trillion, when the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked an AI frenzy in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. But surging demand for AI and cloud computing has turbocharged Microsoft’s growth in the last three years. The company on Wednesday reported 2025 fiscal-year revenue of close to $282 billion, up from $198 billion in the fiscal year before ChatGPT, and net income of $102 billion, up from $73 billion. With about 7.4 billion shares outstanding, Microsoft stock will need to close at or above $538.13 to stay in the $4 trillion club. Shares were up 5% just above $539 in recent trading.

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram has seen its share price blitz from $90 to $784 in the last three years Meta raced to a new all-time high on Wall Street on Thursday morning, with the parent company of Facebook and Instagram seeing its share price increase more than 13% to $784.70 per share. The big jump comes a day after Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, reported $47.52 billion in second quarter revenue — easily topping analyst projections. Meta also estimated it would report up to $50 billion in third quarter sales, which also pleased investors, while Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li, on the earnings call, reiterated that the company is focused on investing heavily in artificial intelligence. And on the topic of AI, Zuckerberg said “superintelligence” — where AI models beat humans in nearly all tasks — is “in sight.” His comments on continuing to invest in artificial intelligence come after he said in January this would be a “defining year for AI.” That same month, Zuckerberg said Meta would spend between $60 billion and $65 billion to “significantly” expand its AI team; the company then updated that projection during its first quarter earnings call in April, saying it planned on spending up to $72 billion this year on the tech — a figure Meta once again noted in its second quarter report on Wednesday. Zuckerberg has already put Meta’s money where his mouth is, with the company investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI, a company that offers a platform and training data for developing AI models, in June. Meta also recently poached four top OpenAI researchers for its AI team, as the company has been extending multiyear offers that reach up to $300 million. Meta’s previous all-time high was $747.90 per share, set just a month ago. The Menlo Park, California-based company’s stock dipped in the weeks leading up to its Wednesday earnings report, but on the year, Meta’s stock is now up 31%. You can take an up-to-the-minute look at Meta’s stock price, below: Other standout figures from Meta’s report included net income of $18.34 billion — up 22% year-over-year — and the company said 3.48 billion people now use one of its apps on a daily basis, although Meta did not share specifics on how each of its platforms is performing. Meta’s big run on Wall Street stands out, considering where the company was just a few years ago. In 2022, Meta’s stock price dropped to $90 per share, after Zuckerberg heavily pushed the “Metaverse” — but the masses ended up not being as excited about the virtual world as he was. Other tech giants will be sharing their latest earnings reports in the upcoming days, including Apple and Amazon, which are both set to report their Q2 financials on Wednesday afternoon.

Title: Whale Buys $153M In Ethereum From Galaxy Digital OTC: Institutions Are Betting Big

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum is once again approaching critical levels after a stretch of volatile yet bullish price action. Following a sharp rebound from yesterday’s low of around $3,675, ETH is now trading above the $3,800 mark, regaining momentum as traders eye a decisive move. While short-term volatility remains, the overall structure favors continuation—provided ETH can break cleanly above the $4,000 resistance level. This threshold now stands as the key barrier between consolidation and a potential rally toward new highs. A confirmed breakout would likely ignite fresh bullish momentum across the broader altcoin market. Until then, price remains trapped in a narrowing range, testing both trader patience and liquidity depth. Meanwhile, on-chain data supports the bullish case. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, whales have ramped up their accumulation, with large addresses steadily adding to their ETH holdings in recent days. This ongoing accumulation trend reflects growing conviction among high-cap players and adds weight to the possibility of further upside in the months ahead. Ethereum’s bullish narrative gained further momentum this week after Arkham disclosed a massive on-chain transaction involving a major institutional player. A fresh wallet address—0xdf0A67Ded855F8ea4baB6399690883243c0e2EF3—just received $153 million worth of ETH, purchased directly through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk. The scale and nature of this transaction suggest growing institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. This isn’t just another whale move. The fact that the ETH was funneled into a new wallet from a regulated OTC provider underscores the strategic accumulation taking place behind the scenes. As traditional finance increasingly integrates with crypto, Ethereum’s utility, programmability, and future role in tokenized finance are making it a high-conviction play among institutional allocators. This heavy buy comes after a prolonged period of weakness. Earlier this year, ETH suffered persistent selling pressure, with price action sliding lower for months. Retail interest faded, and sentiment turned bearish. But while the public panicked, sophisticated players appear to have taken the other side of the trade—accumulating quietly during the downturn. Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade in a tight range just below the key resistance level of $3,860.80, as shown in the 4-hour chart. Despite recent price volatility, ETH has remained above its 50- and 100-period moving averages, currently near $3,756 and $3,629, respectively. This suggests that bullish momentum is still intact in the short term. Volume has picked up slightly, indicating rising interest from traders as ETH tests this critical horizontal resistance. The price has failed to close decisively above this level multiple times since July 25, highlighting its significance. However, the consistent higher lows forming over the past week point to building buying pressure beneath the surface. A confirmed breakout above $3,860.80 could open the door for a push toward the psychological $4,000 level and beyond. Conversely, failure to break resistance may lead to another retest of the 100-period moving average or even the $3,700 support zone.

Title: Is There More Upside For MSFT Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/31/is-there-more-upside-for-msft-stock/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a strong Q4 performance, surpassing consensus estimates for earnings, sales, and its future outlook. This positive news has sent the stock up 8% in pre-market trading, extending its impressive rally of over 50% since its April low of around $350. Despite this significant climb, we believe there’s still considerable upside potential. While Microsoft's current valuation is high, we see minimal cause for concern, making it an attractive investment. Our optimistic view stems from a comprehensive analysis comparing MSFT's current valuation to its recent operating performance and its historical and current financial health. We've assessed Microsoft across key parameters: Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. This analysis reveals Microsoft's exceptionally strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – META Stock To $1,500? Microsoft has demonstrated notable revenue growth in recent years, outperforming the S&P 500. Over the last three years, its top line has grown at an average rate of 12.5%, compared to 5.3% for the S&P 500. In the most recent twelve-month period, revenues increased by 14.9% from $245 billion to $282 billion, while the S&P 500 saw 4.4% growth. Quarterly revenues in the most recent period grew 18% to $76.4 billion from $65 billion a year ago, against a 4.5% improvement for the S&P 500. This consistent, strong revenue expansion supports the company's robust market position. Microsoft exhibits exceptionally high profit margins, considerably exceeding most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Its operating income over the last four quarters was $129 billion, translating to a substantial operating margin of 45.6%, in contrast to 18.3% for the S&P 500. The company’s operating cash flow (OCF) for the same period was $136 billion, indicating a very high OCF margin of 48.3% compared to 19.8% for the S&P 500. Furthermore, Microsoft’s net income of $102 billion over the last four quarters yielded a considerable net income margin of 36.1%, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 11.8%. These strong profitability metrics underscore Microsoft's efficient operations and effective cost management. Microsoft’s balance sheet is characterized by very strong financial stability. As of the most recent quarter, its debt stood at $61 billion, with a market capitalization of close to $4 trillion. This translates to a very strong debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5%, which is substantially lower than the S&P 500’s 23.4%. The company also maintains a healthy cash position, with cash (including cash equivalents) making up $95 billion of its $619 billion in total assets, resulting in a strong cash-to-assets ratio of 15.3% compared to 6.7% for the S&P 500. These figures highlight Microsoft's robust financial health and its ability to manage its liabilities effectively. Microsoft stock has generally shown slightly better resilience than the broader markets during recent economic downturns. During the Inflation Shock of 2022, MSFT fell 37.6% but fully recovered by June 15, 2023. In the Covid Pandemic of 2020, MSFT saw a 28.2% decline from its peak, recovering fully by June 9, 2020, outperforming the S&P 500’s 33.9% drop. Look at Buy or Sell MSFT stock for more details. Overall, Microsoft demonstrates very strong performance across growth, profitability, and financial stability, with its downturn resilience being neutral. This comprehensive analysis points to an overall very strong outlook for MSFT stock. Microsoft’s stock currently commands a premium valuation when compared to the broader market, as well as some of its peers, reflected in its key multiples. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio stands at 14.6, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s 3.1. Similarly, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40.7 substantially exceeds the benchmark’s 22.8. This is higher than its peers, with META stock trading less than 30 times and AMZN stock trading at 39 times trailing earnings. This elevated valuation suggests market confidence in Microsoft's future performance and its strong competitive position. Microsoft's recent performance strongly suggests that a premium valuation is well-deserved. The accelerating growth in Azure revenues, coupled with improving profitability and a robust outlook, points towards a sustained upward revision in its valuation multiple. While the stock currently trades at over 40 times trailing earnings, it has historically commanded premium valuations; for example, its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last four years is 35 times. Consequently, we believe there is still further upside potential for MSFT stock, despite its recent surge. Of course, this optimistic view carries inherent risks. Investors might become hesitant to pay an even higher premium, particularly given the substantial capital expenditure Microsoft is directing towards AI initiatives. It is crucial for investors to thoroughly consider all associated risks before making any investment decisions. However, for those with a 3−5 year investment horizon, MSFT stock, even at its current levels, could offer significant upside potential. Related – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Now, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

This elevated valuation suggests market confidence in Microsoft's future performance and its strong competitive position. Microsoft's recent performance strongly suggests that a premium valuation is well-deserved. The accelerating growth in Azure revenues, coupled with improving profitability and a robust outlook, points towards a sustained upward revision in its valuation multiple. While the stock currently trades at over 40 times trailing earnings, it has historically commanded premium valuations; for example, its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last four years is 35 times. Consequently, we believe there is still further upside potential for MSFT stock, despite its recent surge. Of course, this optimistic view carries inherent risks. Investors might become hesitant to pay an even higher premium, particularly given the substantial capital expenditure Microsoft is directing towards AI initiatives. It is crucial for investors to thoroughly consider all associated risks before making any investment decisions. However, for those with a 3−5 year investment horizon, MSFT stock, even at its current levels, could offer significant upside potential. Related – MSFT Stock To $1,000? Now, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: META Stock To $1,500?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Meta stock (NASDAQ:META) has already achieved remarkable gains, growing 2x from $370 levels in early 2024 to approximately $780 at present. But what could drive the stock to double from its current levels over the coming years? The answer is rooted in AI integration – the main growth engine for Meta. Meta’s AI investments are delivering tangible business results. The company’s advertising revenue reached $46.6 billion in Q2 2025, up 21.5% year-over-year, with pricing growth continuing to propel the core business. Average price per ad increased 9% in the latest quarter, demonstrating Meta’s ability to extract premium value from its AI-enhanced targeting capabilities. The scale of AI integration is significant. Meta's generative AI tools are finding purchase with both users and advertisers, while the company's Llama models are supporting core ad ranking and content recommendations. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional social media advertising to AI-powered precision marketing. While Meta stock holds promise, if you are looking for more stability than investing in an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Also, see – Is There More Upside For MSFT Stock? For Meta stock to double from current levels, the company needs consistent revenue growth of around 15-20% annually, along with margin expansion. This seems attainable through: AI Monetization in Core Advertising: Driving Engagement & User Growth: Strategic Bets & New Revenue Streams: Operational Efficiencies & Cost Management: We anticipate Meta Platforms’ revenues to surpass $265 billion within the next three years, with earnings likely to nearly double from under $24 per share in 2024 to over $45 per share in 2028, due to improved profitability. Currently, META stock trades around $780, pricing it at roughly 28 times its trailing earnings. This is considerably lower than some of its competitors, with Amazon trading at 39 times earnings and Microsoft at 41 times earnings. Given Meta’s deep integration of AI and its improving profitability, we foresee an upward revision in its valuation multiple. Even if the stock holds a similar valuation, it could exceed $1,300 within the next three to four years. If investors assign a higher multiple, it would signify more than a twofold increase from current levels. Also see – Meta’s Valuation Ratios Comparison. The most significant risk is the intensifying competition in AI. Competition from cost-efficient solutions like DeepSeek raises questions about Meta's massive AI infrastructure investments and whether the company can maintain its technological moat. Regulatory pressure on social media platforms could also limit Meta’s ability to monetize user data and expand into new markets, particularly in Europe and Asia. Finally, macroeconomic factors could influence Meta’s performance. Economic recessions could curtail advertising investments across its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. For more details, see – Buy or Sell META Stock? Moreover, high interest rates could render growth stocks like META less attractive than fixed-income options, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Overall, Meta’s path to doubling again depends on successfully monetizing its AI investments while achieving a Reality Labs inflection point. The company's dominant position in social media advertising, combined with aggressive AI infrastructure scaling, creates multiple avenues for sustained growth. However, investors should recognize that reaching $1,500 per share would require Meta to demonstrate that its massive AI spending translates into sustainable competitive advantages and that Reality Labs can transition from a cost center to a growth driver. The opportunity exists, but execution risk remains high as competition intensifies across all of Meta’s key markets. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while building the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a strong record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a collective group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Wall Street poised to open higher, boosted by strong earnings from AI-focused technology sector

By DAMIAN J. TROISE and ALEX VEIGA, AP Business Writers Stocks capped a choppy day of trading on Wall Street with more losses Thursday after an early big tech rally faded and a health care sector pullback led the market lower. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, its third straight decline. The benchmark index, which is just below the record high it set on Monday, notched a 2.2% gain for the month of July and is up 7.8% so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite closed less than 0.1% lower. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 lost ground, with health care companies accounting for the biggest drag on the market. Health care stocks sank after the White House released letters asking big pharmaceutical companies to cut prices and make other changes in the next 60 days. Eli Lilly & Co. fell 2.6%, UnitedHealth Group slid 6.2% and Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 5.8%. Gains by some big technology stocks with hefty values helped temper the impact of the broader market’s decline. Meta Platforms surged 11.3% after the parent company of Facebook and Instagram crushed Wall Street’s sales and profit targets even as the company continues to pour billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. Microsoft climbed 3.9% after posting better results than analysts expected. The software pioneer also gave investors an encouraging update on its Azure cloud computing platform, which is a centerpiece of the company’s artificial intelligence efforts. Big Tech companies have regularly been the driving force behind much of the market’s gains over enthusiasm for the future of artificial intelligence. Elsewhere in the market, design software company Figma soared in its stock market debut. The stock vaulted 250% above its initial public offering price of $33 a share. All told, the S&P 500 fell 23.51 points to 6,339.39. The Dow dropped 330.30 points to 44,130.98, and the Nasdaq gave up 7.23 points to finish at 21,122.45. Earnings remain a key focus outside of the technology sector in what has been a heavy week so far for corporate financial results. CVS Health fell 0.3% after it topped Wall Street expectations for the second quarter and raised its full-year forecast again. In economic news, the Commerce Department said prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index. That’s the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure for inflation. The latest reading was slightly higher than economists expected and also marks an increase from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Results from another measure of inflation earlier this month, the consumer price index, also showed inflation rising in June. Also on Thursday, a report showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits inched up last week. The latest updates on inflation and the jobs market are landing amid lingering concerns about the impact of tariffs. Inflation’s temperature is being closely monitored by businesses and the Fed to better gauge the impact of President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again approach to import taxes. Companies including Ford and Hershey’s have more recently warned that tariffs are weighing on their latest and projected financial results. Trump has said he will levy tariffs against goods from dozens of countries if they don’t reach agreements with the U.S. by Friday. The latest developments in the seemingly unpredictable tariff landscape include a potential pause in tariff escalations with China and a deal with South Korea. However, Trump said Thursday that he would enter a 90-day negotiating period with Mexico over trade as 25% tariff rates stay in place. The reasons behind trade policy decisions remain unpredictable. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order to impose his threatened 50% tariffs on Brazil. He has directly linked the import tax to the trial of his ally, the country’s former president Jair Bolsonaro. He has also said that trade negotiations with Canada would be more difficult in the wake of that nation’s economically unrelated decision to recognize a Palestinian state. Uncertainty over tariffs and inflation have prompted the Fed to leave its benchmark interest rate alone through the central bank’s past five meetings, including the one that ended Wednesday. The Fed has been trying to cool the rate of inflation back to its target of 2%. It has come close, but inflation remains stubbornly stuck just above that target. A cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pressured by Trump to cut the benchmark rate, though that decision isn’t his to make alone, but belongs to the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. “Inflation is only a bit above the Fed’s target, but looks likely to rise in the second half of the year due to tariffs,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “With the job market in pretty good shape, they see room to hold interest rates steady and lean against inflation’s increase near-term.” Wall Street has been tempering their expectations for rate cuts at the Fed’s next meeting in September. Traders now see a 39% chance of a rate cut, according to data from CME Group. That’s down from 58.4% a week ago and a 75.4% chance a month ago. Treasury yields held steady in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was unchanged at 4.37%. The yield on the two-year Treasury remained at 3.94% from late Wednesday. Markets were mostly mixed in Asia and Europe.

Title: How to invest like you’re uber rich (even if you’re not!) (Paul Quickenden)

Let’s be honest - ‘Invest like the uber rich’ sounds like classic headliner clickbait. But here’s the thing… in a tokenised world, that headline is actually starting to hold up because the old barriers to high-value, long-horizon investing are crumbling fast and blockchain is the earthquake shaking the establishment's foundations. There’s always been a bit of mystery around how the global elite build and then keep their wealth. According to recent research reported on by Newsroom, the pattern is actually quite simple, i.e. “a distinctive focus on long-term thinking and alternative assets…” We’re not talking about chasing IPOs or crypto hype cycles here. This is intergenerational capital thinking around assets that hold value over decades and ignoring short-term volatility in favour of upside over time. Traditionally, that’s meant real estate, private equity and infrastructure - assets that are expensive to access and tough to liquidate. But all that’s changing… Fig 1: Multiple sources are now saying that high net worth individuals are getting into alternative investments in a proportional, long term manner (source): Crypto might not seem like a traditional ‘family office’ asset, but it ticks both boxes rich families are drawn to. It's alternative and when viewed through a long-term lens - its reward profile gets interesting. Volatility is still a part of the crypto story, but we’re seeing it flatten as the asset class matures - the highs aren’t quite as high and the crashes are not quite as deep. What’s more, as more infrastructure is built and more institutional capital enters, the swings are becoming less violent. That doesn’t mean crypto is risk-free - nothing is - but it is becoming something far more compelling: an alternative investment class with global reach, deepening liquidity and strong long-term upside for those with patience and a defined strategy. In that sense, it’s already mirroring the kind of thinking that the uber wealthy have leaned on for decades. Traditionally, the kinds of assets favoured by ultra-wealthy investors have been large, expensive and illiquid. Think commercial real estate, infrastructure projects, private equity and even fine art. These aren’t investments you can casually buy into with a few thousand dollars and even when you could, they usually come with long lock-up periods and little flexibility to exit. Enter tokenisation and it’s a genuine game changer… Tokenisation changes that by using blockchain technology to break these big-ticket assets into smaller, digital units - or fractionalising into ‘tokens’ - that can be bought and sold individually. It’s a bit like owning shares in a company, but instead, you own a fractional slice of a building, a venture fund or any other real-world asset. The key difference is that these tokens exist on a blockchain ledger, meaning ownership is secure, transparent and (potentially) tradeable 24/7. This is a big deal, because traditionally these types of assets have been the exclusive domain of the rich and powerful. A case in point is a tokenised villa in Dubai which sold in under 5 minutes (see here). Tokenisation enables everyday investors to own a slice of a premium commercial property without needing millions upfront, waiting decades to cash out or going through the typical real estate grind. This is the future of investing, and it looks a lot more inclusive than the past. And it’s not just real estate. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have both tokenised Money Market Funds, Goldman Sachs has issued a 2 year digital bond, while it is common to tokenise gold and carbon credits. Fig 2: A deep dive into the benefits of tokenisation. Benefits Description Example Faster Transaction Settlement Tokenisation enables near-instant, 24/7 settlement instead of traditional 2 or more days Goldman Sachs issued a €100M digital bond with same-day settlement (T+0) using blockchain Increased Liquidity By fractionalising traditionally illiquid assets, tokenisation opens markets to more investors and enables easier trading. Tokenising private equity or bonds lets investors buy small shares, bringing in more liquidity and opening up market access Operational Efficiency & Cost Savings Embedded smart contracts enable automatic execution of payments, compliance, and other conditions, enabling new business models. Automating interest calculations in tokenised corporate bonds streamlines servicing and compliance.Smart contracts for carbon credit tokens automate trading with transparent, enforceable rules Enhanced Security & Transparency Immutable blockchain ledgers provide auditable, tamper-proof ownership records; tokenisation also replaces sensitive data with secure tokens. JPMorgan’s JPM Coin improves payment security and settlement transparency on a permissioned blockchain Democratisation of Access Lower minimum investments and seamless global participation bring asset classes traditionally reserved for elites to wider audiences. Fractional tokens allow smaller investors to access high-value assets like art, real estate, and private funds Global Reach & 24/7 Markets Tokenised assets can be traded cross-border, anytime, breaking time zones and geographic barriers inherent in traditional finance. Swiss Digital Exchange supports tokenised securities trading round-the-clock with global investor participation Tokenisation is more than just a trend; it’s a fundamental shift in financial infrastructure. By enabling fractional ownership and recording it on-chain, tokenised assets bring transparency and auditability to markets that were once closed off to all but the wealthiest. They also inject liquidity into asset classes that have traditionally been locked up for years. Together with blockchain rails and crypto-based value transfer, this technology is building a new model of wealth creation - one that doesn’t care how big your starting balance is, only that you’re ready to play the long game.

Title: Miami Showband massacre 50 years on: ‘The trauma lasts for ever’ – Stephen Travers

Full Content:
The Miami Showband’s days were numbered. The band had formed in 1962, playing its first gig in Portmarnock, at the Palm Beach Hotel, which inspired the group’s original name, the Miami Showband. Thirteen years, seven Irish chart-topping singles and several line-up changes later, lead singer Fran O’Toole and guitarist Tony Geraghty had both asked bass player Stephen Travers, who had only joined the band two months earlier, if he would like to play in their separate musical projects. In the meantime it was business as usual. After big gigs in Salthill, Co Galway, on Monday and Tuesday, the band met up at what is now the Regency Hotel near Dublin Airport and travelled north, over the Border, to play the Castle Ballroom in Banbridge on Wednesday, July 30th, 1975. A midweek gig in a midsized town was bread and butter for the Miami but a lifeline for locals who wanted to lose themselves in music and dancing and forget the Troubles. When the band reached Banbridge, Stephen and Fran, who had a sweet tooth, went to buy sweets. Stephen was unnerved when he saw skinheads running towards them, but one just wanted Fran’s autograph on his plaster cast. The band members never drank before a gig so they probably wouldn’t even have noticed the pub next door to the ballroom, much less been aware of its tragic Troubles story. The Signpost Inn had been owned by Jack McCabe, a past pupil of Dublin’s prestigious Blackrock College, who had abandoned a law career to take over the family business on the death of his father. On July 12th, 1972, he was shot dead in his other pub in Portadown. The gig didn’t start till after 11pm, so it was 2am by the time the band set off home. Stephen sat up front with his bandmate Brian McCoy, who was driving, while Fran, Des Lee and Tony Geraghty played cards in the back. At about 2.30am, halfway between Banbridge and Newry, the minibus was flagged down by an army patrol. The musicians were lined up outside and asked for their names and addresses. The roadblock was fake, however, although at least five of the soldiers there were serving or former UDR members. They were also loyalist paramilitaries. As two of them, Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, planted a bomb on the bus, it exploded prematurely, killing them instantly. The explosion blew the musicians into a field, where four were hunted down. Fran was shot 22 times, mostly in the face, Brian nine times and Tony four times. Stephen was hit; Des hid in the long grass, playing dead, and was not hurt. Stephen counted his fingers. As a musician, that was important. Next, he clicked his platform heels. He still had his legs. He was disorientated, however. “I didn’t know I was shot. I couldn’t figure out why my stomach was so distended. There was this terrible silence. The ditch was still on fire. I was crawling among the bodies, talking to them. I wouldn’t accept that they were dead. “I couldn’t stand up. I’d get up and fall down. For the hour or so I was there I was crawling around on my stomach. I found it difficult to breathe. I didn’t know that after the dumdum exploded inside me, part of it had travelled up after entering just above my right hip and went through my left lung which had collapsed. You often see someone after running a marathon sort of bending down and trying to get their breathing right. I tried that. I crawled over to the ditch and there was a low branch and I tried to lean over it, but no matter what I did I couldn’t get it right. I put it down to one of the soldiers having punched me in the kidneys.” James Blundell, the surgeon at Newry’s Daisy Hill Hospital who saved Stephen’s life, told him the anaesthetist had to compress his aorta to keep him alive until he received a blood transfusion. The Rev William McCrea, a Free Presbyterian minister and later a Democratic Unionist Party MP, conducted a UVF paramilitary funeral for Boyle and Somerville. (Decades later, he would also officiate at the funeral of Loyalist Volunteer Force leader Billy Wright.) [ ‘I was glad to see that it did come out that it was collusion’Opens in new window ] UDR sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell and lance corporal Thomas Raymond Crozier were convicted in 1976 of the murders. Imposing the longest life sentences in Northern Ireland history, the judge said he would have imposed the death penalty, had it not been recently abolished. Former UDR soldier John James Somerville, Wesley’s brother, was also convicted of the murders, in 1981. Stephen spent months recovering. The Miami reformed, having replaced Fran, Tony and Brian, but it felt macabre. “We became photo ops.” He left the following summer. As part of a criminal injuries case, Stephen had to see a psychiatrist. “He said, ‘I don’t like the way you’re handling this.’ I said, ‘Here’s the bottom line: I went to a gig, on the way home the lads were killed, I was shot, I survived, I’m fine.’ There was no such thing as counselling back then. Only sissies complained about their feelings.” The psychiatrist told him his response wasn’t normal. “He said, ‘I must warn you, in six months or 10 years the wall might fall on you.’” Stephen reflects with the benefit of hindsight and education. “I stepped back for 30 years, said I’m not going to talk or think about it, but that did awful damage.” He felt that as a musician in Ireland he could never escape his past, so he and his wife moved to London in 1983. One night he was having a drink in an Irish pub when the owner asked everyone for a business idea. Stephen saw a copy of The Irish Post and said that it needed competition. Within months, the Irish Advertiser was launched, with him as editor. The paper became The Irish in Britain News. Stephen cofounded another newspaper, The Irish World, in 1987. Three years later, I got my first job on The Irish World, moving to The Irish in Britain News, the two papers Stephen had helped to found, before spending nine years with The Irish Post, where Stephen wrote for me about music. I was in Harry’s Bar in Banbridge in the mid-1990s when a former Banbridge Academy classmate said loudly, “I hear you’re working for a Provo paper.” There is a certain type of unionist for whom anything Irish – be it the language, traditional music, the GAA or even a newspaper – is a republican front and a personal affront. Stephen and his family moved home in 1998. In 2000, he testified at Justice Henry Barron’s official inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Margaret Urwin, secretary of Justice for the Forgotten, a campaign group for its victims and survivors, told him that the Miami Showband massacre was not an isolated attack but one of many perpetrated by the Glenanne gang. In December 2011, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) report on the Miami killings raised “disturbing questions about collusive and corrupt behaviour”. It confirmed Mid-Ulster UVF leader Robin Jackson’s involvement and linked him to RUC special branch. The report also revealed that on June 11th, 1975, more than a month prior to the killings, Jackson, his brother-in-law Samuel Fulton Neill and Thomas Crozier had been arrested for possessing four shotguns near Banbridge, but no charges were brought. Neill’s car was reportedly used in the Miami ambush, which took place just over a mile from Donaghmore, where Jackson grew up. Neill was shot dead in Portadown on January 25th, 1976, allegedly by Jackson for informing. Stephen said at the time, “We believe the only conclusion possible arising from the HET report is that one of the most prolific loyalist murderers of the conflict was an RUC special branch agent and was involved in the Miami Showband attack.” As he explained to me, “People said you now have the smoking gun of the culpability of the British State.” An independent international inquiry, chaired by Douglass Cassel of the Law School of the University of Notre Dame, concluded that there was “credible evidence that the principal perpetrator [of the Miami attack] was alleged RUC special branch agent Robin Jackson”. On May 19th, 1976, two of Jackson’s fingerprints were discovered on a silencer home-made for a Luger pistol. The silencer and Luger were found in a police raid on former B Special Ted Sinclair’s farm. The exhibit was mistakenly labelled, indicating that Jackson’s prints had been found on insulating tape wrapped around the silencer. Jackson, arrested on May 31st, denied having been at Sinclair’s farm but admitted knowing him through the Portadown Loyalist Club. When shown the Luger, silencer and magazine (but not the tape), Jackson denied having handled them. Asked to explain why his fingerprints might be on either pistol or silencer, Jackson said he had given Sinclair adhesive tape in the club. Although ballistic testing had linked the Luger (for which the silencer had been made) to the Miami attack, Jackson was never questioned about the killings, and the Miami inquiry team was never informed. Jackson claimed that one week before his arrest, two high-ranking RUC officers had told him his fingerprints had been found on the tape and that “I should clear as there was a wee job up the country that I would be done for and there was no way out of it for me.” Despite a detective inspector’s recommendation, the officers faced no disciplinary action. Jackson was only prosecuted for possession of the silencer. The trial judge, Mr Justice Murray, acquitted him, saying, “I find that the accused somehow touched the silencer, but the Crown evidence has left me completely in the dark as to whether he did that wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly.” Former RUC officer and convicted loyalist paramilitary John Weir told the Barron Inquiry that Jackson had co-ordinated the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Justice Barron concluded that Weir’s “evidence overall is credible”. Weir claimed Jackson had shot dead Catholic chemist William Strathearn in Ahoghill, Co Antrim, in 1977. Weir and RUC colleague Billy McCaughey were convicted of the murder but both named Jackson and another loyalist, RJ Kerr, as the killers. Jackson was never questioned for “reasons of operational strategy”, according to an RUC detective. Weir suggested that “Jackson was untouchable because he was an RUC special branch agent”. Weir had offered to testify against Jackson and Kerr if the murder charge against him was withdrawn. The prosecutor rejected this offer, saying that “Kerr and Jackson have not been interviewed by the police because the police state [that] they are virtually immune to interrogation and the common police consensus is that to arrest and interview either man is a waste of time. Both men are known to police to be very active and notorious UVF murderers.” Jackson was not unbreakable; he was untouchable. [ From the archive: Claim that hundreds of deaths in North happened due to collusionOpens in new window ] Mr Justice Barron was highly critical of the RUC. In 2006, a Dáil committee concluded that some loyalists, notably Robin Jackson, “were reliably said to have had relationships with British intelligence and/or RUC special branch and exchanges of information took place”. The Irish News reported in January 2020 that British ministry of defence documents linked SAS-trained undercover officer Captain Robert Nairac to the atrocity. Nairac was abducted and killed by the IRA in 1977 and his body has never been found. The papers were disclosed to solicitor Michael Flanigan, who represented Fran O’Toole’s widow, Valerie Andersen, in her legal action against the MoD and PSNI chief constable. It is understood the redacted documents contained suggestions that Nairac obtained equipment and uniforms for the killers. The file also claimed that he was responsible for planning and executing the attack. [ Who was Robert Nairac and what happened to him?Opens in new window ] A UVF handkerchief decorated with handstitched paramilitary figures and mottos was found among Nairac’s possessions. It is displayed in his regiment’s museum in London. The Miami victims’ families and survivors took a civil action against the police and the British ministry of defence. A settlement was only reached in December 2021, exactly 10 years after the HET report’s damning findings. They received £1.5 million to settle claims of collusion without any admission of liability. Stephen received the largest settlement, £425,000. “It’s all very well to say they settled without admission of liability, but they don’t pay you for annoying them. At the beginning they laughed at us, said we didn’t have a case. The PSNI and MoD put up every barrier, the three Ds: delay, deny and, ultimately, death.” That at least five UDR men were involved is only the tip of the iceberg for him. He dismisses the notion of rogue elements in the security forces and believes collusion was systemic. “Far more sinister people were involved. So-called experts concentrate on individuals but that is just very clever deflection. It was policy from the very top. Some of the bravest men I met were in the RUC. There was a point in the chain of command at which good reports just disappeared.” Almost 50 years have passed since the atrocity. How much of his life has he spent managing its repercussions? Should he prioritise his mental health over his feeling of responsibility to pursue justice? In 2005, Stephen’s friend Michael Gallagher, who lost his son Aiden in the 1998 Real IRA Omagh bombing, asked him to take part in an anti-radicalisation project at Warrington Peace Centre, set up in memory of two children, Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball, murdered by the IRA. He was asked to bring an object that related to his trauma. He brought Tony Geraghty’s guitar strings. He listened to a British soldier who had been abused as a child and suffered from alcoholism. “I felt I could help this man by telling him how I had coped, but I was in denial. When it came to my turn, I introduced myself, but when I went to take out the guitar strings, 30 years after the psychiatrist predicted it, the wall fell on me. I wasn’t in Warrington, I was in the field, I could hear all the screaming, the obscenities, the gunfire, the terror all around. “The soldier that I had been feeling sorry for had his arm around me and was telling me this is okay, it happens. This was the first time that I had shed a tear over the incident. I was ashamed that I had shown my feelings.” Stephen describes his post-traumatic stress thus: “It’s like when a TV producer is telling people which monitor to look at. For me it’s like there are two monitors. One is normality, which I’m focused on most of the time, but there is another big monitor and I’m drawn to that sometimes, and that is what happened on July 31st. When we went back on the road, sometimes I heard the fans screaming and thought it was something else.” When Stephen’s father served in the British army, he contracted malaria. It resurfaced from time to time over the years, just like Stephen’s trauma. [ Why I wrote Dirty Linen: recording the toll the Troubles took on my parish, the long tail of traumaOpens in new window ] “My father is the man I wish I could be,” Stephen says. “I once asked him what is the greatest achievement a person could have, and he said peace of mind. I didn’t understand then, but I understand now. “It helps you to manage it better, but it doesn’t ease it. No one back then ever mentioned PTSD. I’d never heard of enduring personality change. It was first used for people who had been in concentration camps. Having had that explained, I now know how difficult it was for me to fit into my old world but also how difficult it was for my wife to deal with me. “I have been in the incident for 47 years. It doesn’t happen that they take out the bullets and sew you up, and it is gone. The trauma lasts for ever.” Stephen helped set up a victims’ support group, the Truth and Reconciliation Platform. “I think the best way to speak up is to talk about your own experience. We wanted to get people from both communities to tell their stories. It has been a great education, but it came with a price.” Is it good for him, though? I am conscious of the irony. I am interviewing him about his trauma. “It’s essential,” he replies. “I certainly don’t have peace of mind but I would have less if I didn’t process the trauma by using it to help others. I think I’m stuck with that for the rest of my life and all I ever wanted to be was a bass player.” What good does it do? “An immense amount. I heard a woman on a radio show, coming back on the day after she spoke about her husband’s murder: ‘Yesterday I was nobody and my husband was nobody but today I am somebody and my husband is somebody.’” In 2005, to mark the 30th anniversary, Dana and Dickie Rock sang at an interdenominational service in Dublin’s Pro Cathedral. Brendan Bowyer headlined a memorial concert in Vicar Street. Another service was held in Portadown, with 15 marching bands, to commemorate two of the killers. In 2015, The Miami played their final gig at the Linenfields Festival in Lenaderg. The month before, 200 people had gathered at the ambush site to lay a wreath on the 40th anniversary. In Dublin, Stephen attended a ceremony at the memorial in Parnell Square. In 2019, Netflix released the Emmy-nominated documentary ReMastered: The Miami Showband Massacre. Yet in Banbridge, where Fran O’Toole, Brian McCoy and Tony Geraghty played just before they were murdered, there is nothing to acknowledge what happened. The Castle Ballroom is now a bingo hall. I am struck by the parallels between two of the UK’s most notorious serial killers in the 1970s. Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, born in 1948, murdered 13 women and attempted to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980. Most of his victims were sex workers, whose low standing in the eyes of the public and particularly the police was believed to be a factor in the failure to apprehend the killer sooner. He was given 20 life sentences, converted in 2010 to a whole life order. He died in prison in 2020. Robin Jackson, the Jackal, was born two years before Sutcliffe, and his first murder was two years before Sutcliffe’s too. They were both HGV drivers, exploiting this to prey over a wide area. The low standing of Catholics in the North, particularly in the eyes of many in the British security forces, who perceived them as pawns in the war against the IRA, is the likeliest reason why he was never convicted of any of the 50 or so murders attributed to him. He died at his home in Donaghcloney in 1998. This is an extract from Dirty Linen: The Troubles in My Home Place by Martin Doyle, published by Merrion Press in 2023 and in paperback in 2024. The Bass Player: Surviving the Miami Showband Massacre by Stephen Travers will be published in September by New Island Books. The Miami Showband 50th Anniversary Memorial Concert takes place on Monday, September 29th, in Vicar Street, Dublin. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘Nothing Stops This Train’—Fed Dollar Crisis Predicted To Trigger ‘Critical’ Bitcoin Price Shock

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 07/31 update below. This post was originally published on July 30 Bitcoin and crypto prices have soared this year, with the combined crypto market topping $4 trillion amid a Satoshi Nakamoto-era bombshell. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price, up almost double from this time last year, hit an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin earlier this month and is braced for an Elon Musk shock after his rocket company SpaceX set alarm bells ringing. Now, as traders bet on a new “infinite money glitch," legendary billionaire Ray Dalio has recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “We are at the at the point of no return because we’ll be having more debt,” Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said on The Master Investor Podcast and calling the situation in the U.S., the U.K. and other countries a “doom loop.” "How do you pay all this debt and all this debt service plus everything else? The only way to do that is for the government to create debt and borrow that money to pay and the central bank printing the money." U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through Covid-era lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile. 07/30 update: The Federal Reserve has left interest rates on hold, as the market had expected it would do, though governor Christopher Waller and Fed vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman voted for a cut, the largest number of dissenting votes by Fed officials in just over three decades. “If we cut rates too soon, maybe we didn’t finish the job with inflation. History is dotted with examples of that,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference. “If you cut too late, then maybe you’re doing unnecessary damage to the labor market.” Earlier, data showed the U.S. economy grew at a stronger-than-expected pace in the second quarter as a growing trade balance and renewed consumer optimism propelled GDP to 3% for the three months from April through to the end of June. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed following the Fed’s interest rate decision, with one crypto company executive dismissing interest rate-led market swings as noise. “Institutions are in a race, for some it’s existential, for relevance in the next-gen financial internet,” Johnny Garcia, managing director of institutional growth and capital markets at VeChain, said in emailed comments, adding the "chatter and excitement around the direction of Fed rates is centrally focused on looking for buoy to send crypto prices higher–not about fundamental adoption.” Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have exploded onto Wall Street and into company’s treasuries in recent years, with companies led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sucking up around 2.5 million of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. “Nothing is stopping this train; least of all short-term one-off market-based factors such as the U.S. Federal funds rate," Garcia said. "When markets take into consideration the effect of central bank lending rates, it’s through the following perspective lens: current state and the direction of financial conditions and secondly expected economic activity as a result.” Tesla billionaire Elon Musk hit the campaign trail for U.S. president Donald Trump last year, issuing doomsday warnings over the spiraling U.S. debt pile and this year falling out with Trump over his failure to rein in spending. Musk called the dollar “hopeless" earlier this month, posting to his social media platform X that his new America Party would use bitcoin over so-called fiat currency. Dalio went on to advise investors to allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold or bitcoin, going far beyond the 2% bitcoin allocation recommended by BlackRock, which has found phenomenal success with its $85 billion spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). “[If] you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or bitcoin,” Dalio said, with his comments cheered by those in the bitcoin and crypto world. “The man has a point,” the X account of crypto asset manager Bitwise posted alongside a chart of U.S. debt shown soaring to around $35 trillion. “Dalio is merely suggesting putting a small portion of your deposit into time-tested assets, just like major funds do,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments. “15% of a portfolio is a rather small share—after all, the remaining 85% can be invested however you like. Both gold and bitcoin are considered safe-haven assets in times of high inflation. Gold needs no introduction as it’s a historically protected asset. And bitcoin is often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ especially given the way regulation is evolving and how banks and governments plan to use it." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious Meanwhile, bitcoin price and crypto analysts are predicting this is "critical" time for the market as investors increasingly pour cash into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Bitcoin could quickly reclaim $120,000 and push into price discovery,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. "The timing is critical. Spot bitcoin ETFs, and now ethereum ETFs, which have seen over $5 billion in flows in the past month and outpaced bitcoin on several days, continue to absorb institutional demand. With regulatory clarity taking shape and a coordinated federal stance now emerging, institutional adoption may accelerate meaningfully.” Mena added he believes the bitcoin price could soar be catapulted as high as $150,000 per bitcoin within the next couple of months if the Trump administration makes a “strong declaration around the strategic bitcoin reserve” Trump ordered the creation of in March.

Title: Trump-Appointed Group Calls For Easier Crypto Regulations From Federal Authorities

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A task force established by President Donald Trump has issued a comprehensive crypto report advocating for clearer regulations governing digital asset markets. Released on Wednesday, the report calls on federal regulators to utilize their existing authority to create more definitive rules surrounding the trading of digital assets, thereby facilitating the adoption of innovative financial products. According to Bloomberg, the White House described the report as an essential step toward positioning the United States at the forefront of the blockchain revolution. “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can usher in the Golden Age of Crypto,” officials stated in a fact sheet accompanying the report from the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Formed through an executive order signed by Trump in January, the task force has proposed a variety of policy measures aimed at addressing the complexities of the digital asset landscape. Among its key recommendations is the urgent passage of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which seeks to eliminate regulatory gaps by granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority to oversee spot markets for non-security digital assets. The report also emphasizes the need to embrace decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies as a vital component of the evolving financial ecosystem. The report also urges both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC to act swiftly, providing clarity on critical issues such as registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping to enable federal-level trading of digital assets. These recommendations come on the heels of Trump’s recent signing of a congressional bill called the GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, marking a significant victory for the cryptocurrency industry. This new law establishes rules for US dollar-backed stablecoins, which proponents believe will pave the way for broader integration of digital assets into the financial system. The White House has indicated that additional details about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be forthcoming. This reserve is expected to consist of approximately 198,000 Bitcoin that the government has seized from criminal cases and other proceedings. An executive order issued earlier this year mandated that the Treasury Department retain these Bitcoin holdings, with directives to explore budget-neutral methods for acquiring more. The report also addresses other crucial issues, including the need for clarity on Bank Secrecy Act obligations to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. On tax policy, it recommends that Congress classify digital assets as a new category subjected to modified tax rules applicable to securities or commodities. Furthermore, it calls for legislation to extend wash sale rules to digital assets, preventing investors from claiming tax losses on securities if they repurchase similar assets within a designated timeframe.

Title: Parliament – OPEKEPE finale (Part A), PASOK’s touchy ones, PPC’s garbage venture, Enel and Stassinopoulos’ investments ///

– Greetings,As we said yesterday, we weren’t going to get any wiser about the OPEKEPE scandal from the parliamentary debate—unless someone actually bothered to watch it (and honestly, who in their right mind would do that at the end of July?). But if they did, they’d have come away with two things crystal clear.First: not one of the accused admitted that there was—or is—anything fishy going on with farmer and livestock subsidies, whether under this government or previously, at least since 2014, when the technical solution was put in place. In other words, neither PASOK nor SYRIZA can accuse each other of misappropriating subsidies for farmland and livestock—because they’ll both get tangled up once the Parliamentary Inquiry and audits begin. Let’s say it again: 100,000 tax IDs have illegally pocketed money—are we really saying they’re all New Democracy voters?Second: I’m told that the PASOK and SYRIZA MPs who did bother to attend the session probably realized that all this talk about “criminal organizations,” felonies, and political money doesn’t hold water. It’s one thing to turn a blind eye and let some voters or little cliques of crooks cash in—and a whole other story to claim someone’s pocketing cash on a minister’s orders and kicking back bribes. That’s unfortunately what Androulakis implied the other day, in a stunning display of sleaziness—especially coming from a PASOK guy. I mean, even Tsipras himself, back when they cooked up the Novartis case in Parliament, played the “neutral observer” just so it wouldn’t land squarely on his shoulders. PASOK glory days – KoutsoukosLet’s move on to lighter stuff—it’s almost August after all.Yesterday, the likeable former MP, former minister, former ADEDY unionist, but always-PASOK man Yiannis Koutsoukos took a jab at us for our piece about the Papandreou era, the DEI’s Mavrakis, and the 500 million drachma “gift” scandal.“You guys at protothema went overboard with Andreas and that Mavrakis gift back in 1986, just to make Mitsotakis look squeaky clean,” he wrote.To which we reply—with love:Dear Mr. Koutsoukos—PASOK, those were the days—your party leader himself talked about olive oil producers in Crete getting a bit extra from the EU funds. So how exactly does that whitewash Mitsotakis?In any case, we’re not offended, and no—we didn’t go overboard. If we had, believe me, you’d know.But since you’re keeping score—and if I’m not mistaken, you’ve been with PASOK for over 30 years—maybe you can shed some light on that Mavrakis story. Did Andreas really kick him out over a rumored 500 million drachma gift, or is it just an urban legend? And if anyone else knows more about that saga, we’re all ears. Determined to back their stocksFrom where I’m sitting, it looks like the bankers are dead set on backing their own stocks—and by extension, the stock market itself.In yesterday’s analyst briefing, Piraeus Bank CEO Christos Megalou revealed something noteworthy: the bank plans to launch a share buyback in Q4, using €100 million of the €500 million total payout to shareholders from the 2025 earnings. The bank’s leadership decided to bring forward part of the distribution plan and will proceed with the buyback in 2025. The goal is for buybacks to become a permanent fixture in the shareholder reward program. PPC invests in garbageIt’s not just water that PPC is eyeing as a strategic asset—or at least, one the government sees as a plus in the water management project.The utility is moving quickly with its redevelopment plan in Western Macedonia, rolling out two major investment initiatives: massive data centers and waste-to-energy (WtE) projects.Capitalizing on the energy transition, which is sending lignite to the history books, PPC is shaping a multi-layered energy and environmental footprint in the region, aiming to build new infrastructure and create jobs.The plan is already taking form, with the first steps toward building a WtE unit—set to serve as a pilot in circular economy practices in the former lignite region.I hear they’ve already hired a consultant and are exploring national and EU funding sources, including green investment tools. Acquisitions and investments by Enel – MacquarieBig plans for Greece are in motion at Principia—a joint venture between Enel and Macquarie Asset Management.Amid the volatile and shifting renewables landscape, Principia has aggressively expanded, acquiring four operational wind farms in Greece with a total capacity of 150 MW from EDP Renováveis for €200 million.But here’s the kicker: the deal also includes management of two high-voltage substations—adding depth to the acquisition.Over the last 8 months, Principia has boosted its installed capacity by 50.21%, reaching 727 MW. This fall, it plans to complete Greece’s first battery energy storage system (BESS), a 49MW/98MWh project in Mount Vouno, Halkidiki.What’s more, in 2026, it’s planning to start construction in Crete on a large hybrid project combining 70MWp of solar with a 111MW battery (BESS).The EDP Renováveis deal is being funded with Principia’s own capital and loans from Greek banks. M. Stassinopoulos and Metallurgy of EpirusMichalis Stassinopoulos continues to dip into his own pockets, raising the share capital of Metallurgy of Epirus by €1 million to cover losses from previous years.It’s worth noting that he did the same thing last July—adding €1.5 million.Besides minting coins, the company also produces shell casings—defense being a particularly hot sector right now. The OPAP gameIt may sound repetitive, but the Tzoker jackpot streak has hit 38 consecutive rounds—which, as you can imagine, means big bucks for OPAP.The jackpot has soared past €18 million, and OPAP is raking in an extra €2 million in revenue thanks to the hype.The organization is capitalizing on this unprecedented public interest by pushing the digital transformation of its retail network—with tools like the OPAP Store App and beefed-up loyalty programs.At HQ, the focus is now on AI and machine learning to deliver personalized customer experiences.Meanwhile, the OPAP stock has climbed past €19, with a market cap over €7 billion, making it the 6th biggest on the Athens Exchange—just behind Alpha Bank (€7.5 billion). Aegean under strange pressureYesterday marked Aegean’s seventh straight losing session. The stock dropped from €12.90 to €12.50, defying the general market uptrend.Clearly, there’s a heavy seller at play—odd, given that Aegean is flying high:It’s in a strong market position during another booming tourist season.Athens remains a hot destination even off-season.Favorable exchange rates and fuel prices are working in its favor.And the airline has a clear expansion strategy, increasing fleet size and targeting promising new routes (India, etc.).The weak dollar is especially helpful, lowering the cost of future aircraft lease payments.Plus, Aegean offers one of the highest dividend yields not just for 2025, but beyond.All analyst reports are bullish: Alpha Finance has a €14.60 target, Eurobank Equities €15.60, and Barclays is at €16—projecting much higher annual EBITDA after a stellar Q1.The company is expected to announce Q2 results in September (last year it was Sept. 11). If the first-quarter trend holds—which was its best Q1 EBITDA ever—then an upward rerating is likely. ADMIE leadership hits the roadADMIE Holdings’ market cap is closing in on €800 million, and the holding company’s leadership is gearing up for a broad and ambitious roadshow in September—not to talk about the power grid operator’s potential, but about the stock’s prospects.The first dividend will be cut on August 25, with a second one likely to follow.ADMIE is rolling out a bold €6 billion investment program through 2030, fundamentally changing its operations.The plan, backed by regulators, focuses on upgrading electrical infrastructure, strengthening energy security, and pushing Greece’s energy transition.Island interconnections (Dodecanese, Crete, Cyclades, Attica) are part of the program’s ambitious timeline. Record runs for Metlen, Aktor, GEK TERNA (and Frigoglass, Kyriakoulis for connoisseurs)From banks to heavy industry—that’s where investor interest has shifted on the Athens Exchange, keeping it close to its yearly highs and the 15-year record of 2,000 points.With a buyer surge at the close of trading, Metlen hit a new record above €47.5, just ahead of the August 4th dual listing in London and Athens.It gained 3% yesterday and closed the seven-month stretch with nearly 42% gains.GEK TERNA returned to its yearly highs, helped by a bullish report from Piraeus Securities, setting a price target at €31 (a 45% upside).The stock shook off last week’s profit-taking and is heading toward €21.5 and 25-year highs. Its next highest prices were seen back in January 2000. It’s up 15.8% so far this year.AKTOR also hit a record, touching €6.2 for the first time since October 2009.With small gains over the last six sessions, it keeps pushing multi-year highs—up more than 26.7% in 2025. The completion of AKTOR ATE’s acquisition has boosted investor sentiment.That said, the main index’s green close doesn’t reflect the session’s tone—banks came under pressure, and the action was in small caps.EYDAP fell 1.96% after five straight gains (+28.2% total), closing at €7.49 on thin volume.OLP rose 2.99% to €48.25.Big moves (for market connoisseurs only) happened in micro caps: Frigoglass soared 12.3% to €0.566 and Kyriakoulis rose 2.9% to €2.49. TIF front and center for… TIFEven though Helexpo management is keeping this year’s honored country at the Thessaloniki International Fair (TIF) under tight wraps—a month before the official opening—it seems the government’s plans for the fairground’s redevelopment have been finalized.At the Prime Minister’s speech during the 89th TIF, the complete urban renewal plan for the city center site will be announced.The government took seriously the concerns of local groups asking for more green space and less concrete.Sources say the area will retain its exhibition function, but a massive 200-stremma (20-hectare) metropolitan park will be created.Gone are the hotel and shopping mall from the original blueprint.Half the total area will become green space, with added expansion using land from the Third Army Corps and Agia Fotini.As for the honored country of the 89th TIF—negotiations with the folks in robes (read: Gulf states) aren’t easy and still involve many moving parts. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange brazenly ignores fundamentalsYesterday, official data was released showing that the German economy contracted again in the second quarter of the year. German GDP fell by -0.1% on a quarterly basis, following a -0.3% drop in the first quarter.In stark contrast, the DAX index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange continues its impressive rise in 2025, demonstrating strong resilience and trading at new all-time highs. The DAX is soaring around the 24,250-point level, with a 12-month return of approximately +32% and a 2.44% gain in the last month. The index hit its all-time record of 24,639 points on July 10, 2025.According to the German Ministry of Finance, investment in the real economy is declining—both from the public and private sectors.The DAX’s surge is driven by a handful of strong-performing stocks like SAP, Siemens, Deutsche Telekom, Rheinmetall (boosted by defense spending), and Allianz.This upward momentum remains fragile, however, due to external geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges. Beef becomes a luxury itemIt’s not just happening in Greece. Nor just in Europe. It’s happening everywhere.The famous “New York Steak,” the iconic American cut, has now been bumped into the luxury goods category.Never before has beef been so expensive.In the U.S., retail beef prices have hit a record high of $6.10 per pound—about €10 per kilo—based on official data from the Department of Agriculture.Over the past three years, beef prices have increased by more than +50%, due to a severe shortage of cattle.Ranchers have downsized their herds due to high interest rates, expensive feed, and ongoing drought conditions.As of July 1st, the U.S. cattle inventory stood at 94.2 million head—the lowest midyear level since records began in 1973, according to the USDA.There are suspicions of oligopolistic behavior in the American economy: just four companies now control 85% of meat processing.Processors now influence 62% of the final retail price—compared to just 36% in the 1980s.Ranchers are getting poorer with meager earnings—and consumers are suffering from inflated grocery bills. China dominates rare earth exportsCNBC revealed that in June, China exported 3,188 tons of rare earth permanent magnets—marking a +160% increase compared to the previous month, May.The famed “rare earths” have now become a strategically critical market for the global high-tech industry and for the green transition.Permanent magnet rare earths are vital materials for a wide range of advanced industrial applications, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, high-efficiency electric motors, and telecommunications systems.With more than 80% of the global supply, China holds a hegemonic position in the rare earth value chain.This explosive +160% jump in June exports may be due to short-term moves by Chinese companies to take advantage of favorable prices or to get ahead of upcoming regulations and tariffs.The issue is that international demand is growing exponentially—and for now, only China can meet it.

Title: JPMorgan, Coinbase Forge Historic Pact For Direct Bank-Crypto Wallet Integration By 2026

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. JPMorgan Chase and crypto exchange Coinbase have announced a new partnership on Wednesday that marks a pivotal shift in the relationship between traditional finance and digital assets. As the crypto industry experiences a bullish resurgence, fueled by a more favorable regulatory environment in the United States, major financial institutions are reassessing their earlier skepticism toward digital currencies and are now eager to explore the opportunities within this sector. The recent passage of key legislation—the GENIUS Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and anti-Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) bills—through Congress has encouraged more banks and firms to consider integrating digital assets into their operations. This renewed interest comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market has reached an impressive valuation of approximately $4 trillion, with expectations for continued growth as regulatory clarity emerges in major markets. Starting in 2026, JPMorgan customers will be able to fund their Coinbase wallets using Chase credit cards, according to Reuters, therefore facilitating easier access to cryptocurrency purchases. The partnership also allows Chase customers to redeem credit card reward points for Circle’s USDC stablecoin. This feature, alongside the ability to link bank accounts directly to Coinbase for funding crypto purchases, reflects the increasing integration of digital assets into everyday financial transactions. Stablecoins, which are designed to minimize price volatility, are positioned as essential tools for facilitating seamless transactions in both trading and payments. They are now under a new regulatory framework established by the GENIUS Act, which was signed by President Donald Trump. Market analysts have noted that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is set to accelerate in light of the recent legislative changes. BCA Research highlighted that companies within the crypto ecosystem are well-positioned to benefit from this growth, suggesting that increased adoption will lead to price appreciation for digital assets. Coinbase’s stock, COIN, has responded positively to the partnership news, rising by 6% in Wednesday’s trading session, closing the day at $377 and reflecting a broader trend in the company’s performance. With shares up around 50% this year, Coinbase has achieved a market capitalization of approximately $95 billion, further solidifying its role as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. Reuters highlighted that the crypto exchange’s recent inclusion in the S&P 500 index underscores its growing significance and acceptance in the mainstream financial world. Other financial institutions are also taking steps to engage with the crypto market. Earlier this month, PNC Bank announced its collaboration with Coinbase to offer cryptocurrency trading to its customers, indicating that the interest in digital assets is not limited to JPMorgan alone. Citibank, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America are among the largest US banks joining this growing trend, in which cryptocurrencies are expected to benefit tremendously.

Title: Trump Watch: Trump falls asleep during major health launch

Time Published: 2025-07-31T08:47:38Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump matters a lot to Mzansi and the rest of the world right now. Trump is changing the way America works – and how the world’s most powerful country deals with the rest of the world. We’ll track what he does and connect the dots to your daily life. Trump falls asleep during major health launch President Donald Trump looked like he was falling asleep during a major health announcement at the White House. During a televised event on Wednesday, Trump struggled to stay awake while his health boss, Dr. Mehmet Oz, explained how the US government plans to upgrade the healthcare system using tech, apps, and artificial intelligence. As Oz spoke about diabetes, weight-loss plans, and using QR codes to manage prescriptions, Trump kept blinking slowly and closing his eyes. He looked like he wasn’t following a word. The video quickly went viral. “Trump is fighting for his life to stay awake,” joked one journalist on X. Another user wrote: “Was he up all night golfing?” But the sleepy moment came during a big shift: Americans will soon be asked to move their health records to private platforms linked to companies like Google, Amazon and Noom. These apps will read lab results, track medical progress, and even suggest diets using AI. Officials say the data will stay private and only be shared with permission. Trump didn’t respond to questions at the end. Image source: File South Africa offers cash, gas, chickens but Trump won’t budge South Africa is running out of time to stop massive US tariffs, despite offering billions in trade and investment. With just days to go before a 30% tax hits SA exports to the US, government officials say they’re still waiting for real feedback from Washington. South Africa has put a major deal on the table, including nearly R60-billion in local investment into US industries like mining and recycling, a 10-year gas import agreement, and easier access for US poultry and blueberries into the SA market. In return, it’s asking the US to scrap harsh tariffs on sectors like agriculture, shipping, and small business exports. But the US hasn’t responded, and the deadline is Friday. If nothing changes, South African exports will take a big hit. Already, car and steel exports have dropped by 30%. Citrus farmers warn their fruit could go unsold, News24 reported. Talks hit a wall over Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), which some US officials oppose. Trade Minister Parks Tau says SA has “put its best foot forward,” and a crisis plan is now being prepared. Only five countries have made deals with the US so far. South Africa says it’s ready, but the clock is ticking. Image source: File Trump turns on Israel over Gaza starvation Donald Trump has told Israel to open the gates and “let every ounce of food” into Gaza, admitting for the first time there is “real starvation” in the region. The US president made the comment during a messy 70-minute press conference at his Scottish golf course, where he met UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump directly contradicted Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who called reports of starvation “a bold-faced lie”. Trump replied: “Look at the kids. That’s real starvation. You can’t fake that.” He said Israel must do more to let aid through, while blaming Hamas for not releasing hostages. He also claimed the US and allies would set up “walk-in food centres”, but gave no details. Meanwhile, Trump said he was losing patience with Putin and gave Russia 10–12 days to agree to a Ukraine ceasefire before new sanctions kick in. He praised Starmer but told him to “cut taxes” and “get tough on immigration” if he wants to win the next UK election –comments likely to annoy Downing Street. Outside Trump’s golf course, protesters waved Palestinian flags and called him a bully. One said, “If it was my grandchildren starving, I’d want people to speak up too.” Image source: File Trump’s caddie drops the ball – literally 🚨🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿⛳️ #WATCH — A caddie was seen dropping a ball for President Donald Trump during his Scotland golf trip. Did he make par?pic.twitter.com/HgKuzHFXHa Donald Trump was caught in a cheeky golf moment during his visit to Scotland, and social media isn’t letting it slide. A video shot from a nearby building shows Trump arriving at his Turnberry golf course in a cart. As he pulls up near a tricky spot on the fairway, one of his caddies walks ahead and drops a ball on the grass. A few seconds later, Trump steps out with his club and strolls straight toward it. “Who needs talent when you’ve got a personal ball-dropper?” joked one X user. Another wrote, “Him and Kim Jong Un would be an unstoppable team.” The video popped up just hours after Trump met with European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen at the same course. Together, they announced a massive $1.35-trillion trade deal between the US and EU. Turns out, a sneaky golf ball placement gets more clicks than global economics. Image source: File Trump named in Epstein files but White House says it’s “fake news” The White House is denying reports that President Donald Trump was told in May that his name appears in files linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The Wall Street Journal says Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Trump, telling him the documents included hundreds of names, including his, but that it didn’t mean he did anything wrong. Trump later said he was never told. A White House spokesperson called it “fake news,” while Trump’s team blamed “criminal leakers and the liberal media.” Trump had promised to release Epstein-related files during his campaign, but supporters are now angry that no “client list” has come out. The FBI says no such list exists. A judge this week refused to release grand jury records from Epstein’s 2006 Florida case, saying it would break secrecy laws. Meanwhile, Congress is trying to force the justice department to hand over files, and to make Ghislaine Maxwell testify from prison. Maxwell, jailed for helping Epstein traffic underage girls, says she’ll decide after a meeting with the justice department. Democrats say the Trump team is covering up. Even some Republicans are joining efforts to get the files released. Trump once called Epstein a “friend” but says they fell out in 2004. Image source: File Trump wants to punish South Africa over links to Russia A US committee just passed a Bill that could worsen America’s relationship with South Africa. The “US-South Africa Bilateral Relations Review Act of 2025” calls for a full review of ties between the two countries, and possible sanctions on top ANC and government officials. The Bill passed by 34 to 16, mostly supported by Republicans, and now heads to the full House. If it becomes law, the Trump administration must look at whether SA has harmed US interests, and name any leaders guilty of corruption or human rights abuse for possible US travel bans. The Bill says South Africa is close to America’s enemies, Russia, China, Iran, and even Hamas. It also slams SA for accusing Israel of genocide and pushing anti-Taiwan policies. The Bill’s sponsor, Republican Ronny Jackson, has strong links to pro-Israel donors. But top Democrat Gregory Meeks called the Bill “heavy-handed” and said it would hurt long-standing US-SA ties. South Africa’s foreign minister said diplomacy is the way forward, and denied any anti-white violence. The ANC says the Bill is politically motivated and ignores decades of shared struggle and partnership. Image source: File Trump wants minerals from Africa and a place to send migrants US President Donald Trump met five African leaders at the White House last week. It was a surprise, since Trump doesn’t usually focus on Africa. The countries he chose. Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Gabon, all have oil, gas, and rare minerals. Trump said the US wants to move from giving aid to doing trade. He even shut down the US aid agency, USAID. But trade wasn’t the only thing on the table. Trump asked the leaders to help with immigration by taking in people the US wants to deport, including asylum seekers and criminals, while their cases are still being processed. The leaders talked up their mineral wealth. Trump, not knowing Liberia speaks English, told its president he had “beautiful English.” Experts say Trump wants to lock down mineral deals and maybe find new places for US military bases in Africa, especially after Niger kicked them out. But sending migrants to poor countries won’t be easy. One analyst said instead of dumping people, the US should help African countries build jobs so their youth don’t risk dying trying to leave. Image source: File Trump demands peace but Putin won’t back down in Ukraine Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t seem surprised or shaken by Donald Trump’s latest threats. Trump, who once promised to end the war in 24 hours and improve US-Russia ties, has now sent weapons to Ukraine and warned Russia of heavy sanctions if there’s no peace deal in 50 days. Putin had hoped for better ties with Trump but always made it clear that his main goal was victory in Ukraine. Kremlin insiders say Trump’s shift is disappointing, but not unexpected. A former official said, “Putin always cared more about the war than friendship with Trump.” Trump grew frustrated after six calls with Putin led nowhere. He joked that after each “nice” call, Melania would point out another bombing. Putin’s forces have been stepping up attacks, using drones and missiles to hit Ukrainian cities, the Guardian reported. Still, Moscow isn’t giving up on Trump. Russian insiders believe he’s emotional and might change course again. With over 100,000 Russian soldiers dead, Putin wants a clear win. Peace, he says, will only come if Ukraine agrees to stay neutral and gives up land. Far-right voices in Russia now say a full clash with the US is likely, and may already be underway. Image source: File Trump posts fake AI video of Obama being arrested in Oval Office Donald Trump reposts AI-generated video depicting Barack Obama being arrested. pic.twitter.com/r7dBKjHrAB US President Donald Trump posted a fake video showing former president Barack Obama being arrested by FBI agents in the Oval Office. The video, made using AI, shows Obama in handcuffs and being dragged away while Trump watches. Trump posted the video on his Truth Social platform with the words: “No one is above the law.” There was no warning that the video was fake, and many people who saw it believed it was real. Trump has often attacked Obama and claims that Obama’s government worked to destroy his presidency. Trump has also said that he wants to jail his political enemies if he wins a second term. His post comes shortly after Tulsi Gabbard, the US intelligence chief, accused Obama’s team of starting the “Russia hoax” to make Trump look bad after his 2016 election win. No evidence has been shared publicly, and Obama has not responded. The White House has not commented on the video. Image source: File Doctors reveal Trump has blood flow disease in his legs The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump has a condition that affects blood flow in his legs. Doctors found that the 79-year-old US president is suffering from something called chronic venous insufficiency. It means his veins are not working properly, and blood is not flowing back to his heart like it should. The condition was found after Trump had some swelling in his lower legs. A White House doctor checked him and said it’s not life-threatening, but could become painful or disabling if not treated. Experts say the disease happens when vein valves are damaged or weak, causing blood to leak backwards and collect in the legs. Symptoms can include swelling, pain, cramps, itchy skin, varicose veins and even wounds that don’t heal. It’s most common in people over 70, but can also affect pregnant women, overweight people, or anyone who stands or sits too long without moving. The White House said Trump does not have any blood clots or blocked arteries, which is good news. His doctors have told him to wear special stockings and keep exercising to improve blood flow. On the same day this news came out, Trump also told his Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all secret grand jury files in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. Image source: File Trump’s 30% tariff could kill 100,000 South African jobs US President Donald Trump’s new 30% import tax on South African goods could destroy around 100,000 jobs in the country. South Africa’s Reserve Bank governor, Lesetja Kganyago, said on Wednesday that the agriculture and car-making industries will be hit the hardest. Speaking on radio station 702, Kganyago said the agriculture sector could suffer badly. “Farming employs many low-skilled workers. The new tax will hit products like oranges, grapes and wine,” he said. He also raised the alarm about South African car exports, which have already dropped by more than 80% after Trump started taxing imported cars in April. “If we don’t find other solutions, we could lose up to 100,000 jobs,” he warned. South Africa already has one of the world’s highest unemployment rates. The official jobless rate is 32.9%, and the broader rate is over 43%. Farmer groups say the new taxes will also hurt macadamia nut, fruit juice and ostrich leather exports. In the citrus industry alone, about 35,000 jobs are at risk. The new tariffs could destroy small towns like Citrusdal in the Western Cape that depend on fruit exports to the US. Image source: South African Reserve Bank Top Trump ally turns on him over Epstein case One of Donald Trump’s closest allies, Mike Johnson, now says the truth about Jeffrey Epstein must come out. Johnson is the Speaker of the House – a powerful job in the US. He says the US government must show the public all the files it has on Epstein. Epstein was a rich man who was arrested for trafficking underage girls. He died in jail in 2019. Many people don’t believe the official story that he killed himself, and they think powerful people who were involved with him are being protected. Trump had promised to make everything public. But now he says people should stop focusing on Epstein and has called the case “boring”. That has made many of Trump’s Maga supporters very angry. They believe Trump broke his promise. Johnson said: “We need to put it all out there and let people decide.” He also asked Trump’s top lawyer, Pam Bondi, to explain why she once said Epstein’s “client list” was on her desk, but hasn’t released it. Trump said Bondi can decide what files to release, but Bondi refuses to talk about Epstein. She says she’s focusing on fighting drug dealers and human traffickers. Many Maga supporters are now turning on Trump. Some are burning their red Trump hats in protest. Image source: File Trump’s wife tells him to stop being soft on Putin Donald Trump has admitted that his wife, Melania, has influenced how he deals with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump said that after having “pleasant” conversations with Putin, Melania would scold him. “I come home and say, ‘I had a great talk with Vladimir today,’ and she says, ‘Really? Another city in Ukraine just got bombed.’” Now, Trump has changed his tone. He warned Putin that Russia has 50 days to agree to a peace deal in Ukraine or face tough new tariffs. He also announced that the US will send more weapons to help Ukraine, Daily Star reported. Melania, who was born in the former communist country of Yugoslavia and grew up in Slovenia, has strong views about Russia’s war in Ukraine. She says she remembers what it was like living under a communist government and often reminds Trump of the suffering in Eastern Europe. Even though Melania no longer lives full-time at the White House, Trump said they speak often and that she “knows what she’s talking about”. Trump’s warning to Russia comes just months after he called Putin “crazy” and begged him to stop bombing Ukraine. He said if no peace deal is reached in 50 days, he will hit Russia and its trade partners with heavy tariffs. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he spoke to Trump on the phone this week and that they agreed to speak more regularly about how to end the war. Image source: File Trump crowns himself as ‘Superman’ Donald Trump has shared an image of himself as Superman, complete with muscles, a tight suit, and a cape. The AI-generated picture, posted on the official White House social media page, shows Trump’s face on a superhero body and includes the words: “THE SYMBOL OF HOPE. TRUTH. JUSTICE. THE AMERICAN WAY. SUPERMAN TRUMP.” The post is part of Trump’s ongoing efforts to present himself as a strong leader ahead of the 2026 elections. He’s often said he’s the only one who can save America, and now he’s using superhero-style images to back it up. But not all his supporters are happy. Some MAGA followers have started burning their red hats in protest after the White House said there would be no further public release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Videos online show frustrated Trump supporters setting their caps on fire. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump’s army using robot animals to protect air bases Donald Trump’s US military has deployed robot coyotes to guard air bases as part of his push to use high-tech tools to protect Americans and look tough doing it. The fake animals are designed to scare away birds and other wildlife that could damage fighter jets or cause crashes during take-off and landing. They’ve been rolled out at major US air bases after successful trials. Each robot is shaped like a coyote, a wild animal similar to a jackal, and rides around on wheels like a remote-controlled guard dog. Coyotes are natural predators of many smaller animals, and their presence is enough to keep birds from settling near runways. The US Army’s research team developed the cyborg coyotes alongside the Department of Agriculture. The goal: protect expensive aircraft and military crews from bird strikes and animal interference. The move fits with Trump’s image-heavy military style. He often talks about “peace through strength” and has supported flashy defence projects involving space weapons, military parades and giant spending plans. Officials say the robot coyotes may soon be upgraded with cameras, sensors, and even artificial intelligence. Image source: @armenberjikly Trump bragged he threatened to bomb Moscow and Beijing in secret talks Donald Trump told private donors that he once warned Vladimir Putin he would “bomb the s*** out of Moscow” if Russia invaded Ukraine. The comments were caught on new recordings from Trump’s presidential campaign. Trump claimed he told Putin directly: “If you go into Ukraine, I’m gonna bomb the s*** out of Moscow.” He said Putin didn’t believe him but added, “10% was enough.” The recordings are featured in a new book called 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America. Trump also claimed he gave the same warning to Chinese president Xi Jinping, threatening to “bomb the s*** out of Beijing” if China attacked Taiwan. “He thought I was crazy,” Trump said in the recording. “But he believed me 10%. That’s all I needed.” Despite saying he could end the war in Ukraine in “24 hours,” Trump has failed to stop the conflict since returning to office. This week, he announced more US military support for Ukraine after talks with Putin made no progress. In the same recordings, Trump said student protesters supporting Palestine should be kicked out of the country. “Throw them out,” he said. “That will stop it.” He also bragged about pressuring a rich donor into giving him R460-million, saying the man originally only wanted to give him R18-million. The White House and the Kremlin have not yet responded to Trump’s comments. Image source: File Trump says no more delays for new tax on South African goods US President Donald Trump says that new, higher taxes on goods coming from other countries, including South Africa, will start on 1 August. He says there will be no more delays or changes. Trump had already put a 10% tax on imports from almost every country back in April. Then in July, he said some countries would be taxed even more, but he paused those increases. Now, he says the bigger taxes will go ahead as planned. In messages sent to leaders around the world, Trump said countries like South Africa, Japan, South Korea and others will face taxes of between 25% and 40% on goods they send to the US. He also warned that if any country hits back with their own taxes, the US will raise its taxes even more. Trump said this will bring in lots of money for the US. His finance minister said the US could make more than $300-billion from these taxes by the end of the year. Trump says the taxes are meant to fix “unfair” trade deals. But some people are worried the plan will make goods more expensive and cause problems between countries. The US has only made a few new trade deals so far, with the UK, Vietnam and China. Talks with other countries are still going. Image source: File Trump hits South Africa with 30% tax on all goods US President Donald Trump is putting a 30% tax on everything South Africa sends to America – and it starts in August. Trump has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa and other world leaders, saying it’s time to stop what he calls “unfair trade”. He says South Africa has had an advantage for too long by using trade rules that favour it and not the US. The tariff will hit South African products being sold in America. Ramaphosa tried to get Trump to back down, but it didn’t work. Trump says the US trade deficit (when a country imports more than it exports) is a threat to both the economy and national security. He also warned that if any country tries to fight back, he’ll raise the tariffs even more. Ramaphosa has responded, saying Trump’s view of trade between the two countries is simply wrong. Image source: File Trump slams Elon Musk for starting new political party Donald Trump has attacked Elon Musk on social media, calling him a “train wreck” who has “gone off the rails.” The US president spoke just after Musk announced he’s launching a new political group called the “America Party.” Trump said third parties don’t work in the US and only cause “chaos.” He claimed the system is built for two major parties and accused Musk of trying to disrupt the country when there’s already too much division. He also said Musk is upset because Trump’s new tax-and-spending bill removes the electric vehicle (EV) mandate – a rule that would’ve pushed more people to buy EVs. Trump says Americans should be able to choose between petrol cars, hybrids or electric vehicles. He added that Musk had backed him before, even though Trump was always against the EV mandate. The president also said Musk once asked for a friend to lead NASA, but that person turned out to be a Democrat who had never supported Republicans. Trump said that was a red flag, especially because NASA works so closely with SpaceX, Musk’s company. Trump ended by saying his job is to protect the American people. His comments follow Musk’s announcement that the “America Party” will contest elections starting in 2026. Musk said the new party will break the power of the two-party system by focusing on a small number of key seats. Though Musk was born in South Africa and cannot run for president himself, he has been vocal about wanting political change. In a poll he ran on social media, two-thirds of voters backed the idea of a new party. Musk said that was enough to launch it officially, saying the country needs “freedom from the one-party system.” Image source: File Trump celebrates new bill and says UFC fight is coming to the White House Donald Trump has kicked off 4 July celebrations by bragging about his new tax-and-spending bill, and announcing that a UFC fight will take place on the White House lawn. Speaking at a rally in Iowa, Trump said: “There could be no better birthday present for America” than the passing of his new bill, which makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent and increases spending on the military and border security. But the bill also cuts healthcare and food support for low-income Americans and will add $3.3 trillion to the US budget deficit over 10 years. During the rally, Trump also said he plans to celebrate America’s 250th birthday (in 2026) with a national state fair and a live UFC championship fight for up to 25,000 people at the White House. “Dana [White, UFC boss] is going to do it. We have a lot of land there,” Trump said. He also mocked Joe Biden, repeated false claims about a stolen election, and attacked Democrats. “I hate them. I really do,” he said. “Because I believe they hate our country.” Trump hinted at a softer stance on immigration, saying farm workers could stay in the US if their employers vouch for them. “We don’t want to remove workers from the farms,” he told supporters. Image source: File America admits Iran’s nuclear sites weren’t ‘obliterated’ like Trump claimed The US Pentagon has admitted that Donald Trump exaggerated when he said he had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites. A spokesperson for the Pentagon, Sean Parnell, said the real damage from the US airstrikes probably only set Iran’s nuclear programme back by one or two years, not destroyed it completely. This comes after Trump celebrated the bombing of Iran’s Fordow site, calling it a huge win and saying the country’s nuclear programme was “completely and totally gone.” But intelligence officials have avoided using Trump’s word “obliterated.” At a press conference, Parnell repeated the word, but admitted that Iran could rebuild in time. “We believe the facilities were heavily damaged,” he said. “But their programme may only be delayed by a year or two.” The bombs used, called “bunker busters”, are designed to hit deep underground. But Iran’s nuclear knowledge and tech were not destroyed. Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran still has the skill to restart the programme. “You can’t destroy the knowledge,” he said. Trump had also claimed that the bombing helped him get a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran, calling it the end of the “12-day war.” But fighting restarted the next day, with both countries blaming each other. The Pentagon is now pushing back against media reports that the strike wasn’t as successful as Trump claimed. Parnell accused journalists of using “false and incomplete” information to make the military look bad. Image source: File Trump says Israel is ready for Gaza peace deal Donald Trump says Israel is now ready to agree to a peace deal with Hamas to end the war in Gaza, a war that has already killed nearly 60,000 people. In a post on his Truth Social page, Trump said: “Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60-day ceasefire.” He added that during that time, the US will try to help all sides reach a full peace agreement. Trump said that Qatar and Egypt, two countries helping to mediate, would now deliver the “final proposal” to Hamas. So far, neither Israel nor Hamas has officially responded to Trump’s announcement. It’s not clear exactly what Israel has agreed to. In the past, similar ceasefire talks have collapsed quickly, with both sides accusing each other of breaking deals, especially around prisoner swaps. Still, Trump seems confident. Speaking to reporters, he said a deal could be reached as soon as next week and that he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. “We want the hostages out, and we want the war to end,” Trump said, the Guardian reported. Hamas has said it is willing to release the remaining hostages in exchange for a deal to end the war. Israel, on the other hand, says the war can only stop if Hamas gives up all weapons and control, something Hamas has refused. Trump is trying to use momentum from the recent Israel-Iran ceasefire and the joint US-Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites to help secure peace in Gaza. He also warned Hamas not to miss this chance. “It will not get better, it will only get worse,” he said. Trump’s announcement came just after an Israeli airstrike hit a café in Gaza on Monday, killing between 24 and 36 people, including children, according to reports. The war began when Hamas attacked southern Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages. Since then, more than 56,500 Palestinians have been killed and nearly the entire population of Gaza has been displaced. Much of the area has been destroyed. Image source: File Trump says Elon Musk would be “back in South Africa” without US money Donald Trump has attacked Elon Musk, saying he only became rich because of US government money, and without it, he’d be back living in South Africa. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said: “Elon may get more help from the government than any person in history. Without that, he’d probably have to close his businesses and go back to South Africa.” Trump said there would be “no more rockets, no more satellites, no more electric cars” if the government stopped giving Musk support. He added: “We’d save a fortune.” This comes after Musk complained about Trump’s new tax plan. The plan removes money and support for electric cars and clean energy. Musk said cutting this support would be “very bad” for the country. Tesla, Musk’s electric car company, has been getting a $7,500 (R133,000) tax break for each car sold. But Trump’s plan would stop that. Tesla is also expected to report poor sales this week. Trump reminded people that he never supported forcing people to buy electric cars. “Electric cars are okay, but no one should be forced to drive one,” he said. Trump also said Musk supported him for president, even though he knew Trump didn’t like electric vehicle laws. Image source: File Trump says he’s found ‘rich buyers’ to take over TikTok Donald Trump says a group of very rich people are ready to buy TikTok’s US operations, but they’ll need permission from China before the deal can happen. Speaking to Fox News, Trump said: “We have a buyer for TikTok. I think China will probably approve it.” He added he would reveal who the buyers are in about two weeks. The US government has been trying to force TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app’s American side or face a total ban. The deadline to make the deal is now set for September 17. TikTok is still very popular in the US, especially with younger users. Trump has even said it helped him connect with young voters during the 2024 election. But the big problem is TikTok’s algorithm, the smart technology that decides what videos people see. It’s protected by Chinese law and is listed in China’s official tech database, which means it can’t be sold easily. China has said before that it might block any sale, especially if it involves the algorithm. And Trump’s tough stance on China, including new tariffs earlier this year, has made things even more difficult. Image source: File Trump posts “Daddy’s Home” video after NATO boss calls him daddy 🎶 Daddy’s home… Hey, hey, hey, Daddy.President Donald J. Trump attended the NATO Summit in The Hague, Netherlands. pic.twitter.com/asJb5FD2Ii Donald Trump just posted a video of himself at a big NATO meeting, using Usher’s song “Daddy’s Home” as the soundtrack. Yes, really. The clip shows Trump walking around the NATO summit like he’s the star of an R&B music video. The words “Daddy’s Home” flash across the screen as Usher’s hit plays in the background. It comes after NATO boss Mark Rutte bizarrely called Trump “daddy” during a press meeting earlier this week. Rutte was trying to describe Trump’s wild rant about Israel and Iran, where Trump said: “Let them fight for a few minutes, it’s easier to stop them.” Rutte jumped in with: “And then daddy has to use strong words to stop them.” Not “Dad.” Not “President.” Just “daddy.” People online quickly slammed Rutte, calling it a clear case of sucking up to Trump. Even Trump joined in the joke, telling reporters: “Daddy, you’re my daddy.” Now the White House has made things even worse with the video, featuring a song that’s full of sexual lyrics. Image source: File Trump turns on spy boss Tulsi over Iran bombing report Donald Trump’s spy boss, Tulsi Gabbard, has been left out of a big security meeting with US lawmakers, and some insiders say she’s now in “the line of fire.” Gabbard was supposed to join top Trump officials in a closed-door briefing with Congress to talk about the recent US strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. But now she’s suddenly off the list, and people close to the White House say Trump blames her for a damaging leak, the Daily Mail reported. Last week, Trump blasted Gabbard after she said Iran wasn’t close to making a nuclear weapon. He told reporters, “She’s wrong.” Gabbard quickly changed her position, saying Iran could make a bomb “within weeks to months.” But the damage was done. A leaked Pentagon report showed the US bombing may have only delayed Iran’s nuclear programme by a few months, far less than what Trump had claimed. Trump said the sites were “obliterated.” The report said Iran might be able to restart soon. Now, there’s a full-blown investigation into who leaked the report, and some White House insiders say Gabbard could be the one who gets the blame. Trump biographer Michael Wolff said: “Tulsi is in the line of fire. Trump always needs someone to blame.” Even though Gabbard publicly supported Trump and said the attacks destroyed Iran’s facilities, she’s been cut from the team giving the official update to Congress. Trump is furious at media reports saying the strike didn’t do enough. He’s attacking CNN and The New York Times, saying they’re lying to make him look weak. CNN reporter Natasha Bertrand broke the story. Trump posted that she should be “fired and thrown out like a dog.” CNN fired back, saying they stand by her reporting. Image source: File US bombs didn’t stop Iran’s nuclear plans A new report says the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites last weekend didn’t destroy them completely, and may have only delayed Iran’s plans by a few months. US President Donald Trump said after the attacks that the sites were “totally destroyed” and that Iran’s nuclear programme was “obliterated.” But a secret report from the Pentagon now says that’s not true. It says some of Iran’s nuclear machines were not fully destroyed, and that Iran had moved a lot of its uranium before the bombs hit. That means they might be able to restart the programme soon, the Guardian reported. The US used big B-2 bombers and huge “bunker-buster” bombs on three sites, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. But one of the sites, Fordow, is buried deep under a mountain, and the bombs couldn’t reach all the way down. The report says Fordow is likely still working and may be used again soon. Trump posted in all capital letters on his social media: “THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!” He’s angry the report got out and says it’s an attempt to make him look bad. But US military leaders are being more careful. One general said the sites were badly damaged, but they are still checking how much was really destroyed. The head of the world’s nuclear watchdog says they don’t know where 400kg of Iran’s uranium has gone. And US Vice President JD Vance admitted they still don’t know where the rest of Iran’s nuclear material is hiding. Image source: File Three people killed in Israel just after Trump announces ceasefire Just hours after US President Donald Trump said the war between Israel and Iran was over, missiles from Iran hit Israel, killing three people. Iran fired six waves of missiles early Tuesday morning, with explosions heard in Tel Aviv and Beersheba. Three people died in Beersheba, according to emergency workers. This happened soon after Trump said he had made a peace deal with Israel and Iran to end the 12-day war. He thanked both countries and said on social media that it was “a historic moment.” But Iran said the fighting would only stop if Israel stopped its attacks. One Iranian official said they had not fully agreed to stop the war. Iran’s last missiles were fired just before the ceasefire was supposed to begin. Over the weekend, the US and Israel bombed Iran’s nuclear sites. Iran denies building nuclear weapons, but Trump said the goal was to stop them from ever getting one. The US dropped heavy “bunker-buster” bombs on underground sites. After days of bombing, many people in Tehran have left the city. Trump said Iran warned them before attacking a US base and that no Americans were hurt. He said he will push Israel to choose peace. Talks between Iran and other countries are still happening. Qatar helped set up the peace deal, and US leaders like Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were involved. Image source: File Iran tells Trump to “bring enough coffins” if you want war An Iranian leader has warned Donald Trump that if the US starts a full war with Iran, they should “bring enough coffins” for their soldiers. This came after the US bombed three of Iran’s nuclear sites using powerful B-2 bombers. Iran is angry and says it will fight back. Ebrahim Rezaei, a top member of Iran’s parliament, said: “Don’t expect us to bury your soldiers. Bring your own coffins.” Tensions are rising fast between Iran, Israel and the US. Many world leaders are calling for peace, but Iran’s army and other powerful groups say they are ready to hit back hard. The US says they don’t want war. Their defence chief said the attack was not meant to kill people, but to stop Iran’s nuclear programme. “This is not about removing Iran’s government,” he said. But Trump is not backing down. On his Truth Social page, he called the attack “a historic moment” and told Iran: “End the war now.” He also warned Iran that if they keep fighting, “there will be peace or there will be tragedy.” Iran says the US helped Israel start a dangerous war and has now made things worse. Some experts warn this could lead to more terrorism and attacks on US soldiers and allies. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump gives himself two weeks to decide on Iran attack Donald Trump says he’ll decide in the next two weeks if the US will join Israel in bombing Iran. This comes as fighting between Israel and Iran enters its second week, with both sides firing missiles and the danger of a bigger war growing fast. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters: “There’s a chance for talks with Iran. The president will decide in the next two weeks if the US will go to war or not.” Trump has also asked the US military if their biggest bombs, the 30,000-pound “bunker busters”, could destroy Iran’s hidden nuclear sites. He says he wants a peaceful solution but is also ready to use force. When asked what his message is to people who voted for him because they wanted “no more wars,” Leavitt replied: “Trust in President Trump.” Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to help make peace, but Trump refused, telling him: “Let’s fix Russia first.” Trump is reportedly thinking about attacking Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a hidden base deep underground. So far, Israel hasn’t hit that target, but Trump might. He’s also posted online that Iran’s leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is “an easy target”, though he says there are no plans to kill him “for now.” Iran has warned the US that choosing war would bring “irreparable harm.” Image source: File Trump says “I may do it” as he thinks about attacking Iran Donald Trump says he hasn’t decided if the US will join Israel in attacking Iran. When asked about it, he gave a short answer: “I may do it, I may not.” He also said, “Nobody knows what I want to do.” Trump believes Iran is in big trouble and says they want to talk. He told reporters that Iran might even come to the White House for talks. But then he also warned that he’s “had it” and wants “unconditional surrender.” Iran’s top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, replied with a warning. He said if the US chooses war, it will cause “irreparable harm.” Iran also said they will not beg or give in to the US. Trump must make a decision soon. US officials say the next 24 hours are very important. Trump doesn’t want to look weak while the fighting between Israel and Iran continues. At the same time, the US has moved warships and planes closer to the region. But the White House says they are only there for defence. Trump also said Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to help make peace between Israel and Iran. But Trump told him: “Let’s fix Russia first.” Image source: File People say more pizza orders in the US mean war is coming An online theory claimed that a rise in pizza deliveries near the Pentagon was a secret sign that war was about to break out. But it turns out Pentagon staff were just… hungry. The idea went viral last week as Israel launched major strikes on Iran. A group of internet sleuths, running the so-called “Pentagon Pizza Report”, noticed a spike in pizza orders near the US defence HQ just before the bombs dropped. They told their 100,000 followers: “All nearby pizza establishments have experienced a HUGE surge in activity.” According to them, when Pentagon staff are working late on military plans, they order loads of pizza — and that’s the first clue that something big is coming. But the White House has now shut that theory down. Officials said the US government already knew about the attacks ahead of time — no pizza clues needed. Experts also rubbished the idea, calling it “confirmation bias” and saying there’s no solid proof. The Pentagon does have late-night food available, but they don’t track what staff are eating. So no, America isn’t using pepperoni pizza to signal a strike. Meanwhile, the real news is much more serious. The Israel-Iran conflict is now in its fifth day. Israel has bombed Iranian targets. Iran fired back at major cities. The region is on edge. Donald Trump has jumped in too. After leaving the G7 summit early, he warned Iran’s supreme leader on Truth Social that the US “knows exactly where he is” — but claimed there were “no plans to take him out (kill), at least not for now.” US officials say Trump is also thinking about joining Israel in attacking Iran’s nuclear sites. So while the missiles are very real, the pizza warning system is not. Sometimes a delivery is just dinner. Image source: File Trump leaves G7 early as Israel-Iran war threat grows Donald Trump is leaving the G7 summit early as the fight between Israel and Iran explodes. He’s heading back to Washington on Monday, skipping the second day of talks in Canada. This comes after Trump warned people in Tehran, Iran’s capital, to evacuate immediately on his Truth Social account. Earlier, Israel told parts of Tehran to clear out before bombing military targets. Now, with things getting worse, Trump says he needs to be home to deal with it. The White House said he’ll still attend the G7 photo and dinner before leaving. But his early exit upset other leaders, who hoped the US would help push for peace. A draft statement said Iran must not get nuclear weapons, and that Israel has the right to defend itself. Trump didn’t sign it, but posted, “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” He also hinted he might try to help end the conflict: “They want to make a deal… but I have to leave here.” Meanwhile, Israel is bombing Iranian sites, and Iran is firing missiles at Israeli cities. Iran also warned it may leave the global nuclear treaty. Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, said killing Iran’s top leader would end the war. The US isn’t in the fight yet, but is moving warships and planes closer. The USS Nimitz is heading to the Middle East to join another US carrier, and two destroyers have moved near Israel. Image source: @WhiteHouse Israel ignores Trump’s orders and attacks Iran Donald Trump told Israel not to bomb Iran. They did it anyway. Just hours before the attack, Trump said he didn’t want Israel to go in, warning it could ruin his peace talks with Iran. But Israeli warplanes launched the strike without US support, and without waiting for Trump’s approval. Now Trump is caught in a dangerous situation. His efforts to calm things down with Iran are at risk, and thousands of US troops in the region could be in danger if things get worse. Trump’s top diplomat was preparing for talks in Oman when the attack happened. Trump had already asked Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to hold off. He didn’t listen. Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham cheered the move, but Trump’s not interested in starting new wars. Unlike past presidents, he doesn’t want the US dragged into foreign fights unless America is directly attacked. After the airstrike, the US made it clear they had nothing to do with it. A short statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: “Israel acted alone. Our priority is keeping American forces safe.” Image source: File Elon Musk says sorry for going too far about Trump Elon Musk has said sorry to US President Donald Trump after the two had a big fight online. “I went too far,” Musk wrote on X on Wednesday. “I regret some of my posts about President Trump.” Last week, the two were throwing insults at each other. Trump said he might stop giving government money to Musk’s company, SpaceX. Musk, in return, said Trump’s name was linked to the Epstein scandal, something Trump strongly denies. Trump hit back, saying Musk had “lost his mind”. Now, people close to Musk say he’s calming down and might want to be friends again. He even deleted a post where he supported removing Trump from office. Musk’s apology came after Trump warned him: “If he keeps trying to punish Republicans, there will be serious consequences.” But Trump didn’t say what those consequences would be. Earlier this year, there were rumours Trump might sell off his Tesla shares, but nothing happened. Even though things got ugly, Trump has stopped attacking Musk for now. He said he wishes Musk well and wants Musk’s satellite internet company, Starlink, to keep running. Vice President JD Vance said Musk made a “huge mistake” by going after Trump. He called Musk’s angry posts “emotional” and said, “I hope Elon comes back, but maybe it’s too late, he went nuclear.” Image source: File Photos show Trump may be wearing a catheter on his leg Photos of Donald Trump at the White House have gone viral after people noticed a weird bulge in his left pant leg. Many think he might be wearing a catheter, which is a medical tube that drains urine into a bag. The bulge looks like tubing running down his leg. Some say it’s a Foley catheter, which is often used for people with bladder problems. Others shared diagrams of how catheters work and said it matches the shape seen in the photos. A few people suggested it might be a leg brace or just wrinkled pants, but many online are convinced it’s a medical device. Trump has not commented, and his doctor has never mentioned any catheter or health issues like this. Still, the internet is buzzing with rumours about his health based on the pictures. Image source: @patriottakes Trump wants to give R18,000 to every baby born in the US Donald Trump has shared a new idea that every baby born in the US between 2025 and 2029 will get $1,000 (R18,000) from the government. The money will go into a special savings account that grows with the stock market. Parents can also add more money, up to $5,000 a year. Trump says this plan will help kids build money for their future. Big business leaders like the CEOs of Uber, Goldman Sachs, and Dell have promised to add billions more to support this idea. The plan is part of a big new law that Trump calls his “beautiful bill.” It’s already passed in the House of Representatives but still needs to pass the Senate. If it doesn’t pass, the baby accounts won’t happen. Trump says the money for this plan will come from changes to welfare programs and a new tax on money sent out of the country. But a government report says the plan would actually add $2.4-trillion to the national debt and cut healthcare and food help for millions of people. Some experts also say the baby accounts aren’t the best way to invest money, and other savings plans might work better. Still, Trump believes the accounts will give kids a good start in life. Other countries like the UK and Singapore have done similar things before, giving money to kids to help them save early. Trump and his supporters say if this bill doesn’t pass, Americans might face higher taxes. So they’re pushing for Congress to approve it soon. Image source: File Trump sends troops to Los Angeles and says “we’ll be everywhere” President Donald Trump has sent troops into Los Angeles after protests broke out over immigration raids. He warned that “troops will be everywhere” and said he wouldn’t let the protests continue. The protests started after ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents raided a detention centre and arrested a union leader. Police used tear gas and flash-bangs on protesters, and the scene quickly got tense. Trump blamed California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, saying they weren’t doing their jobs. He made fun of Newsom on social media, calling him “Newscum,” and said protesters shouldn’t be allowed to wear masks. Governor Newsom responded, saying Trump was trying to “create chaos” so he could send in more troops and scare people. He told everyone to stay calm and peaceful. Around 300 National Guard soldiers were sent to LA over the weekend to help control the protests. ICE said they would keep arresting people who tried to stop their raids. Image source: @USBPChief Elon Musk and Donald Trump go from besties to enemies Donald Trump and Elon Musk used to be best buds. Now, they’re fighting like two celebs in a bad reality show. It all started when Musk called Trump’s new tax bill “disgusting” and told Americans to call Congress and stop it. He even posted a picture from the movie Kill Bill to make his point. Trump didn’t stay quiet. He fired back from the White House, saying he might cancel Musk’s government deals and cut off his billions in funding. Musk clapped back: “Go ahead, make my day.” Then things got even messier. Musk claimed Trump’s name was in the secret Jeffrey Epstein files. There’s no proof, but Musk’s post went viral. Just a few days ago, the two were all smiles in the White House, with Trump even giving Musk a goodbye gift as he left his short government job at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk also said Trump would have lost the election without him, and called him ungrateful. Trump replied, saying Elon had “turned on him” and only got upset because the new bill cuts tax breaks for electric cars. Musk said he never even saw the bill, and accused Trump of hiding it from Congress. Then Musk joked that Trump must have been replaced by a body double, because he used to say the same things Musk is saying now. Just when you thought it couldn’t get wilder, Trump’s old advisor Steve Bannon said Musk should be deported and investigated, claiming he might be in the US illegally. Image source: File Trump banned travel from a country that does not exist US President Donald Trump is being laughed at online after banning travel from a country that hasn’t existed for over 30 years. Trump signed a new executive order blocking people from entering the US from 12 countries. One of them was “Burma,” but that country officially changed its name to Myanmar in 1989. The full list of banned countries includes Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and others. The White House says the travel ban is meant to keep the US safe. But critics say it unfairly targets certain countries and reminds them of Trump’s earlier “Muslim ban” from 2017, which caused protests and confusion at airports. This new ban comes after a recent attack in Colorado, where an immigrant from Egypt was arrested. But Egypt is not on the list. People online mocked Trump for not knowing that Burma and Myanmar are the same country. Others say the ban is more about politics than safety, and that it could hurt the US’s image around the world. Image source: File Elon Musk calls Trump’s tax plan ‘a disgusting mess’ Elon Musk has slammed US President Donald Trump’s new tax and spending plan, calling it “outrageous” and “a disgusting mess.” The plan, which gives huge tax breaks and increases spending, was passed by Republican lawmakers in May. Trump called it a “big, beautiful bill.” But Musk strongly disagreed. On his social media platform X, he wrote: “This massive spending bill is a disgrace. Shame on those who voted for it.” Musk had been working in the Trump government for a short time to help cut waste and lower spending. His team was called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But last week, Musk quit the role. He said trying to fix problems in Washington was harder than expected. At a press event, the White House brushed off Musk’s complaints. Trump’s spokesperson said the president still supports the bill. Musk warned that the bill would raise the national debt to $2.5-trillion and said voters should remove the politicians who supported it. Musk had big plans to cut $2-trillion in government spending, but only managed $150-billion. He also faced backlash over cuts to foreign aid and clashed with other Trump officials, Daily Star reported. His short-term role in government was always limited to 130 days. That time ended at the end of May. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump misled about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa, says adviser Mark Burns Mark Burns, a US pastor and adviser to Donald Trump, says the former president may have been misled about claims that white farmers are being targeted and killed in South Africa. Burns is visiting South Africa for the first time and says the country reminds him of his home state, South Carolina. In an interview with the Mail & Guardian, Burns said he was surprised to learn from South Africans of all races that most people don’t believe in the so-called “white genocide” narrative. He added that of the over 5,000 murders in the last part of 2024, only 12 were farmers, and just three were white. Burns said he met with white Afrikaner farmers who confirmed crime is a problem but denied being targeted for their race. He believes Trump may change his view if he visits South Africa himself and gets accurate information. Burns described Trump as a “man of peace” who wants prosperity for all countries. He said Trump sometimes reacts to what’s shown to him without knowing the full truth and would rethink things if given better information. He also warned that South Africa’s role in Brics, a group that includes Russia and China, could hurt relations with the US by challenging the US dollar. Burns said this makes trade and negotiations harder. Asked if Trump would attend the G20 summit in South Africa later this year, Burns said he couldn’t speak for him, but he would advise him to come and see the situation for himself. Image source: File Trump claims that Biden is a clone US President Donald Trump has shared a shocking post online that says Joe Biden died in 2020 and was replaced by a clone or robot. The original post, made by someone else on social media, said: “There is no Joe Biden – he was executed in 2020. What you see now are clones and robotic copies.” Trump didn’t comment, but he reposted it on his platform, Truth Social, which made it go viral. Some of Trump’s supporters believed it, saying things like “We always knew something was wrong.” Others pointed out things like Biden’s changing eye colour as “proof” he had been replaced, Daily Star reported. But many people laughed at the idea and called it just another crazy conspiracy. One person wrote, “Do you think the Earth is flat too?” Trump has shared strange claims before. He once said Barack Obama wasn’t born in the US and suggested Ted Cruz’s father helped kill President John F. Kennedy. He’s also supported QAnon and made false claims about the 2020 election being stolen. Despite not having any proof, Trump continues to share these kinds of stories, and some of his fans continue to believe them. Image source: File Trump gives Putin two weeks to prove he wants peace in Ukraine US President Donald Trump has warned Russia’s Vladimir Putin that he has two weeks to show he’s serious about ending the war in Ukraine, or the US will respond differently. At the White House, Trump said: “I can’t tell if Putin wants peace, but we’ll find out in two weeks. If he’s just playing games, we’ll act differently.” Trump has recently called Putin “crazy” and accused him of “playing with fire” after Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks on Ukraine in years. At least 13 people, including children, were killed in Kyiv over the weekend. Earlier, Trump and Putin spoke on the phone for two hours. Trump said the call went “very well,” but no peace deal followed, and Russia kept bombing, BBC reported. So far, Trump’s administration has mostly pressured Ukraine, even pausing military support in March. Critics say this makes Russia feel stronger. Russia has now demanded that Ukraine give up land and that the US recognise Crimea as Russian territory. A Kremlin official said Trump doesn’t understand what’s really happening and blamed Ukraine for attacking Russian cities. Meanwhile, Germany has offered Ukraine longer-range missiles, which Russia says could damage peace efforts. Trump is now focusing on a possible summit with Putin instead of pushing for an immediate ceasefire. But with Russia holding about 20% of Ukraine and peace talks going nowhere, the war continues. Zelensky says Russia is stalling, while Moscow claims a peace plan is almost ready. Image source: File Elon Musk quits Trump team after arguing over government spending Elon Musk has decided to leave his role as an adviser to US President Donald Trump. The billionaire businessman said he’s had enough of politics and is frustrated by how slowly things work in government. Musk, who runs Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), announced on X that his time helping the Trump administration has come to an end. He thanked Trump and said his plan to cut wasteful government spending, called the DOGE mission, will still continue without him. Musk had been helping Trump try to cut down the US government’s budget, but said the system is more broken than he expected. “It’s harder to fix things in Washington than I thought,” he told The Washington Post. He quit shortly after criticising Trump’s new spending bill, calling it too expensive and saying it added more debt. In an interview with CBS, Musk joked that the bill was “big” but not “beautiful,” poking fun at Trump’s description of it. Trump said he’s not happy with every part of the bill, but still supports it overall. Musk had been working part-time for the government since January and helped Trump’s campaign with millions in donations. But now he says he’s stepping away from politics completely and going back to focus on his businesses. “I think I’ve done enough,” Musk said. Image source: File Ramaphosa jokes about Trump meeting: ‘I get nervous when the lights go off now’ President Cyril Ramaphosa made a lighthearted joke on Tuesday about his unusual meeting with US President Donald Trump last week. Speaking at an event in Cape Town, Ramaphosa said he now feels uneasy whenever the lights go dim, because of what happened in the Oval Office. During his meeting with Trump, the US president suddenly told staff to turn off the lights and play a video on a TV in the room. The video showed EFF leader Julius Malema singing “Kill the Boer,” a controversial song. The moment caught Ramaphosa by surprise. At Tuesday’s event, when the lights dimmed as he walked onto stage, Ramaphosa joked: “When I saw the room going dark, I thought, what’s going on? Is this happening again?” He laughed and said it reminded him of what happened with Trump. He also joked with journalist Clement Manyathela, who was at both the Trump meeting and the Tuesday event. “Seeing you again gave me flashbacks,” he said, smiling. Ramaphosa said people later told him the Oval Office moment was “an ambush,” but he just found it confusing and unexpected. “I thought we were getting into a good discussion, and then suddenly the lights went out and a video was playing,” he said. Image source: File Russia could attack Europe by 2027 A new report warns that Russia might be ready to attack European countries as soon as 2027, if the war in Ukraine ends or slows down soon. The report, from a top London research group (the International Institute of Strategic Studies), says that a ceasefire would give Russia time to rebuild its army. Even though Russia has lost many tanks and vehicles in Ukraine, it’s already starting to replace them, the Daily Star reported. Experts say that if Russia gets a break from the war, it could rebuild its forces and pose a serious threat to nearby countries like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania within two years. Leaders in Europe, including France’s President Emmanuel Macron, have also warned that Russia still has big military goals and may not stop with Ukraine. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said last year, “It’s not a question of if they’ll start another war, but when.” There’s also growing concern about NATO, the alliance that protects many Western countries. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned whether America should continue to defend NATO countries that don’t spend enough on their military. “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them,” Trump told reporters after returning to office. Experts say that if the US pulls back from NATO, it could weaken the group, making it easier for Russia to act more aggressively in Europe. Image source: File Trump warns Putin that taking all of Ukraine will destroy Russia US President Donald Trump has warned that if Russian President Vladimir Putin tries to take control of all of Ukraine, it could lead to Russia’s downfall. In a post on Truth Social on Sunday night, Trump said, “I’ve always had a good relationship with Putin, but something has happened to him. He’s gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump said he believes Putin wants to take over all of Ukraine, not just part of it, and warned that doing so would be a huge mistake for Russia, The Guardian reported. Earlier that day, Trump told reporters he was shocked by Russia’s latest attacks on Ukrainian cities. He also said he was now considering adding new sanctions on Russia. “He’s killing a lot of people,” Trump said. “What the hell happened to him?” Trump also took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying Zelenskyy was “doing his country no favors” and that “everything out of his mouth causes problems.” He added, “I don’t like it, and it better stop.” Zelenskyy had earlier criticised the US for not speaking out more strongly after Russia carried out its biggest air attack in years. The weekend strikes killed at least 12 people, including three children, and involved nearly 300 drones and dozens of missiles. Despite promising during his campaign to end the war in 24 hours, Trump has not placed new sanctions on Russia, even after it refused a proposed 30-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy’s top aide said more pressure is needed, warning that Russia could continue attacking not just Ukraine, but possibly other countries as well. Image source: File Trump shows wrong photo to claim white farmers are being killed in South Africa During a meeting at the White House with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, US President Donald Trump wrongly said he had proof that white farmers were being killed in South Africa. He held up a picture and said, “These are all white farmers being buried.” But the photo wasn’t from South Africa at all, it was taken in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It shows people being buried after a deadly attack by rebels near the city of Goma. The picture came from a video made by the news agency Reuters in February. Trump had seen the image in an article on a conservative website called American Thinker, which talked about race problems in both South Africa and the DRC. The website didn’t explain where the image was from, but it linked to the original video about Congo. The Reuters journalist who filmed the video, Djaffar Al Katanty, said he was shocked to see Trump using it in the wrong way. “President Trump used my video from Congo to claim white people are being killed in South Africa,” he said, TimesLive reported. The White House didn’t respond to questions about the mistake. The editor of the blog admitted Trump was wrong about the photo, but still defended the article’s message. President Ramaphosa visited the US this week to improve relations. Trump has accused South Africa of mistreating white people, which the South African government says is not true. Image source: File Ramaphosa jokes with Trump: ‘I don’t have a plane to give you’ South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. The meeting had some tense moments, but Ramaphosa used humour to lighten things up. When a reporter asked Trump about a $400-million private jet he reportedly accepted from Qatar, Ramaphosa joked, “I don’t have a plane to give you.” Trump laughed and replied, “I wish you did. I would take it.” But the mood turned tense when the reporter asked if taking the plane was ethical. Trump got angry and said, “You’re a bad reporter. You should be ashamed,” and told the reporter they couldn’t ask any more questions. Ramaphosa tried to keep things calm by repeating his joke, which got another laugh. Earlier in the meeting, Trump showed Ramaphosa a video he claimed showed the graves of over 1,000 white farmers in South Africa and handed him newspaper articles. Ramaphosa, watching with no visible reaction, asked where the video came from and responded: “There is crime in South Africa, but most of the victims are Black.” Trump replied, “The farmers are not Black.” Later, when journalists asked how the meeting went, Ramaphosa said, “It went very well.” Image source: @PresidencyZA Trump drops Elon Musk as friendship falls apart Elon Musk is no longer part of the US government team he once helped lead, and it looks like he’s stepping away from politics completely. The tech billionaire has been removed from the Department of Government Efficiency (called DOGE), and many of his businesses have struggled because of his political opinions and ties to President Donald Trump. Trump used to praise Musk often on his Truth Social account, sometimes mentioning him four times a week. He liked Musk’s bold cost-cutting moves, including firing government workers and shutting down departments. But things have changed. Trump hasn’t mentioned Musk at all since early April, and reports say Musk’s influence in the White House is basically gone. One Republican insider told Politico, “He’s done. People don’t like him anymore.” They said Musk’s attempts to act like an average American didn’t go down well, and instead upset voters. Now, people in Trump’s team see Musk as a problem, not an asset. He used to be viewed as a smart outsider who could help fix government, but now he’s seen as too controversial. There hasn’t been an official announcement, but the silence from Trump’s side says a lot. According to The Independent, Trump’s team is quietly pulling away from Musk. Image source: File Ramaphosa lands in Washington for talks with Trump President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived in Washington DC for an important visit to the United States. He is expected to meet with US President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday. Ramaphosa is travelling with several senior government leaders and political figures, including Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen, Trade and Industry Minister Parks Tau, Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, International Relations Minister Ronald Lamola and South Africa’s new special envoy to the US, Mcebisi Jonas. In a statement earlier this week, Steenhuisen said the visit is both historic and crucial. He explained that his focus is on strengthening trade relations between the US and South Africa, especially in the agricultural sector. He said that maintaining agreements like AGOA is essential to protect jobs, boost the economy and create more employment opportunities. Steenhuisen added that South Africa’s relationship with the United States is extremely important. He warned that losing preferential trade access under AGOA would be a major blow to the country’s economy, especially for farmers and farm workers. The upcoming meeting between Ramaphosa and Trump is expected to address key economic and political issues affecting both nations. Image source: @PresidencyZA Trump to call Putin in push for Ukraine ceasefire US President Donald Trump says he’s ready to speak with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday in a new push to end the war in Ukraine. Trump shared on social media that he’s expecting a “productive day” and hopes to make progress toward a ceasefire. He also plans to speak with NATO leaders. The war, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, has proved difficult to end, despite Trump’s repeated claims that he could stop it quickly. Trump’s top adviser on the matter, Steve Witkoff, said the president believes a phone call with Putin could “clear up the logjam” and get both sides closer to peace. “I think it’s going to be a very successful call,” Witkoff said. But not everyone agrees with Trump’s approach. Bridget Brink, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, resigned last month, saying the administration has been too soft on Russia and too hard on Ukraine. She said the final straw came in February, when Trump and his team criticised Zelenskyy during a meeting at the White House. “Peace at any price is not peace,” Brink warned. “It’s appeasement, and that leads to more war.” Trump said the first call will happen at 10am Monday with Putin. He hopes to stop what he called the “bloodbath” in Ukraine. He also suggested trade incentives might be part of the deal, since Russia’s economy is suffering under US and Western sanctions. Trump posted that he believes this war “should never have happened” and is confident it can be ended soon. Image source: File Ramaphosa and Trump to talk trade, refugees and war President Cyril Ramaphosa is heading to the United States next week to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on May 21. Their goal is to fix tensions between South Africa and the US. Relations between the two countries have gotten worse since Trump returned to office in January. Trump has cut off aid to South Africa and accused the government of unfairly targeting white Afrikaners through its land reform policies. He also allowed 49 white South Africans to move to the US as “refugees,” claiming they were victims of racial discrimination. South Africa says this is not true. Ramaphosa’s team says that the refugee issue is not the most important topic for the meeting. Instead, he wants to focus on trade, investment, and cooperation between the two countries. He will also speak to Trump about: South Africa says it wants fair trade, peaceful diplomacy, and a balanced relationship with the US. Ramaphosa has invited Trump to visit South Africa later this year for the G20 summit and says he’ll see for himself that the country is peaceful and welcoming. South African officials say they expect the meeting to be respectful, even if the two leaders don’t agree on everything. Image source: File Ramaphosa to meet Trump in the US next week President Cyril Ramaphosa will visit the United States next week to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on May 21, his office confirmed on Wednesday. The two leaders will talk about important issues between South Africa and the US, as well as topics affecting the rest of Africa and the world. Ramaphosa’s office says the visit is a chance to improve relations between the two countries, which have become strained since Trump returned to power in January. Trump has cut off all US aid to South Africa, saying he doesn’t support the country’s land reform plans or its legal case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. This week, the US also gave refugee status to 49 white South Africans, claiming they face racial discrimination. The South African government says that claim is not true, and Ramaphosa has said the US is misunderstanding the situation. Even though relations are tense, the US is still one of South Africa’s biggest trading partners, after China. Image source: File Saudi Arabia rolls out mobile McDonald’s for Trump US President Donald Trump was given a tasty surprise during his trip to Saudi Arabia this week, a mobile McDonald’s restaurant set up just for him. Trump landed in Riyadh on Tuesday to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The two leaders signed several major deals, including a $142 billion arms agreement involving US defence companies. But all eyes were on something else parked nearby, a fully equipped McDonald’s on wheels, brought in especially for Trump’s visit, Daily Star reported. The restaurant served the usual favourites like Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, as well as local menu items like the McArabia Kofta, which is served in pita bread. Trump has long been open about his love for fast food. He once ordered 300 burgers to the White House, posed for photos serving food at McDonald’s during his campaign, and starred in a McDonald’s commercial years ago. After attending a funeral in New York last year, he even ordered $200 worth of burgers for his flight home to Florida. Trump once said he prefers McDonald’s because it’s “clean” and he trusts that the food is safely pre-made. According to his biographer, he likes it because he fears being poisoned, and believes McDonald’s food is safer than unknown restaurants. Trump is expected to attend more events in Saudi Arabia before continuing his Middle East tour in Qatar, where reports suggest he may be given a £302 million private jet as a gift from Qatari royals. Image source: @stockbella Trump invites all South African minorities to apply to be refugees The US is now offering asylum to all South African minorities, including Afrikaners, who say they are being mistreated or fear they may be in danger. The US embassy in South Africa announced that people who are Afrikaner or part of a racial minority group in South Africa can now apply to move to the US as refugees. The programme is part of a new order signed by President Donald Trump. To apply, you must: Applicants must complete a form and explain their situation, including how many people are travelling with them and when they’re ready to leave. They’ll be asked what kind of harm they’ve faced, such as unfair treatment because of race, religion, or political views. The first group of people from South Africa has already flown to the US. But in the US, many people are asking why South Africans are being fast-tracked, while thousands of other refugees from war zones, already been approved, are still being blocked. Some lawyers say it’s unfair and may break US law, especially since Trump had earlier stopped refugee resettlement completely. Now, his administration is helping some people while leaving others in danger. A US refugee group said: “Afrikaners are being fast-tracked, while others in desperate need are left behind.” Image source: File Ukraine and Russia may agree to peace talks this week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says there could be a ceasefire with Russia as soon as Monday, with direct peace talks possibly happening later this week in Turkey. Zelenskyy shared the news on social media after speaking directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said both sides may meet in person on Thursday in Istanbul. “We’re waiting for a full and lasting ceasefire starting tomorrow,” Zelenskyy said. “There’s no reason to keep the killing going.” Russia and Ukraine have been at war since 2022. This is the most hopeful update in months. Putin has rejected Ukraine’s call for a 30-day unconditional truce but has offered face-to-face talks without preconditions. Donald Trump, who pushed Zelenskyy to accept the offer, posted: “Have the meeting, now!” European leaders, from France, Germany, the UK and Poland, met with Zelenskyy on Saturday and also demanded a ceasefire starting Monday. They warned Russia of tougher sanctions if Putin doesn’t agree. Putin says he wants peace, but only if it leads to a “lasting solution” and not just time for Ukraine to prepare for more fighting. While the US and European countries see this week’s talks as a chance for peace, many remain sceptical of Putin’s intentions. “This could be a first step,” said French President Emmanuel Macron, “but it’s not enough.” If talks go ahead on Thursday, it would be the most serious chance yet to end the war. Image source: File Trump says having an American pope is a ‘great honour’ The new head of the Catholic Church is Robert Francis Prevost, who will now be known as Pope Leo XIV. He was born in Chicago, studied near Philadelphia, and later worked as a missionary in Peru. Trump praised the historic appointment, telling reporters: “To have the Pope from America is a great honour.” Other American leaders also welcomed the news. Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, said millions will pray for the new pope, BBC reported. Joe Biden, a devout Catholic and former president, wrote: “Habemus papam – May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois.” Barack Obama congratulated the pope as a fellow Chicagoan, calling it a historic day. George Bush said the news brought “hope” for Catholics in America and around the world. While many political leaders are celebrating, there are signs that Pope Leo may have disagreed with some of Trump’s past policies. A social media account believed to be his once shared posts criticising the Trump administration’s deportations and comments made by JD Vance. The Vatican has not confirmed whether the account belongs to Pope Leo. Image source: @CyrilRamaphosa Iran wants to kill Trump to get revenge, says ex-us official Iran is planning to kill Donald Trump to get revenge for the killing of one of their top generals, says John Bolton, a former US security adviser. In 2020, Trump ordered a US airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, a powerful Iranian military leader, in Iraq. Since then, Iran has promised to strike back. Now, Bolton says Iran has made a kill list, and Trump is number one on it. Bolton also believes he is on the list. “Iran is using gangs in Europe and the US to go after people who speak out against them,” Bolton told Sky News. “They’re trying to find and hurt people like me — and Trump is their main target.” Trump was already the target of an assassination attempt last year in the US. At the same time, Trump says his government is now talking directly with Iran to try and stop them from building a nuclear bomb. “We’re having talks. A deal would be better than the alternative,” Trump said. “But if the talks fail, Iran will be in big trouble.” Iran has not said anything yet about Bolton’s claims, but its leaders have often warned the US would pay for killing Soleimani. Image source: File Trump says letting Russia back into the World Cup might help end the war Donald Trump was surprised to learn that Russia is banned from the 2026 Fifa World Cup because of its invasion of Ukraine. When a journalist asked him about Russia’s suspension during a White House Fifa meeting, Trump said, “I didn’t know that. Is that right?” Fifa president Gianni Infantino quickly explained that Russia is currently banned from international football. “We hope peace will come and they can be readmitted,” he said. Trump then suggested that allowing Russia back into the tournament could be used as a peace incentive. “Hey, that could be a good incentive, right?” he said. “We want them to stop. We want the killing to stop. It’s not even believable.” Trump also claimed that hosting the 2026 World Cup, which will take place across the US, Canada, and Mexico, would bring massive economic benefits. He said it would create thousands of jobs and bring in billions for local businesses. “We’ll make sure it’s safe and successful,” Trump promised. “Everyone coming to the US will have a smooth, easy experience.” The US is also set to host the Club World Cup this June. Trump said both tournaments will be “special” and the 2026 World Cup will be “the best run soccer tournament the world has ever seen.” Image source: White House Trump will pay undocumented immigrants $1,000 to leave the US The Trump administration has announced a new program that will pay undocumented immigrants $1,000 (R18,000) if they agree to leave the US voluntarily. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says people without legal status can apply through an app called CBP Home. After they leave the country and it’s confirmed, they’ll get the money. This is a change to an app created under President Biden, which helped people request asylum at the US border. Trump shut that down and changed it so the app now helps people exit the US instead. DHS says this approach saves money. Right now, arresting and deporting someone costs the US over $17,000. By offering a $1,000 incentive, the government says it could cut those costs by 70%. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said it’s the “safest and most cost-effective way to leave” and avoid arrest, the Guardian reported. One person has already flown back to Honduras under the program, and more trips are planned. The government claims people who leave this way might have a better chance of being allowed back legally later, but immigration experts warn that this may be false hope. Critics say it’s a trap and could actually make it harder for people to return legally in the future. This plan is part of Trump’s larger push to reduce immigration and encourage “self-deportation”, which means making life in the US so difficult that people decide to leave on their own. Image source: File Trump announces 100% tariff on movies made outside the US President Donald Trump says all movies made outside of the United States will now face a 100% import tax. He made the announcement on his Truth Social account on Sunday, calling foreign-made films a “national security threat.” Trump says countries like Australia and New Zealand are stealing away American film jobs by offering better deals to Hollywood producers. He wants movies to be made in the US again, the Guardian reported. “We want movies made in America, again!” he posted. He also claimed the move is needed to fight “messaging and propaganda” from other countries. It’s not yet clear how or when the new tax will begin, or whether it affects American companies filming overseas. Film production in Los Angeles has dropped nearly 40% over the past 10 years, according to FilmLA. Meanwhile, countries like Australia, New Zealand and others have attracted big-budget movies by offering tax breaks and cash. Image source: File Trump asks for ‘divine dreams’ and makes virgin joke at prayer event Donald Trump held a big prayer event at the White House on Thursday, where religious leaders asked God to give him “divine dreams” and protect him with “supernatural power.” One man even knelt in front of Trump while others raised their hands and sang Amazing Grace. The event marked National Prayer Day, and Trump used the moment to sign a new order creating a group called the Religious Liberty Commission. Trump, who survived an assassination attempt last year, said he believes God saved his life and is now helping guide his leadership. “We’re bringing back religion in this country,” Trump said. Paula White, Trump’s spiritual adviser, led the prayers. She asked God to give him special dreams, wisdom, and strength. She also said the country needs a spiritual reset, with Trump leading the way. Even though Trump has faced many scandals, including a criminal conviction and selling $60 Bibles, many Christian voters still support him. During the event, Trump also made a joke about a belief that saints in Islam receive 72 virgins in Heaven. “What about 38 virgins?” he joked while speaking about a talk he had with Muslim leaders. “They said, ‘That’s nonsense.’” Trump repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election and said he’s working to protect religion in America, including setting up a team to fight “anti-Christian bias.” One top advisor, Mike Waltz, was missing. Trump later replaced him due to a scandal over leaked messages. Image source: White House Trump jokes about becoming the next pope Donald Trump this week told reporters that he wants to be the next pope. “I’d like to be pope,” Trump said with a grin. “That would be my number one choice.” Users on social media site X quickly made fun of the comment, with one writing, “First time in history, we will have orange pope.” Others pointed out how the media might have reacted if someone else had said it: “Had Biden said something this stupid, the media and MAGA would have a field day,” Daily Star reported. Trump didn’t name a preferred candidate for the real role, but did mention Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, calling him “very good”. The College of Cardinals is set to meet on May 7 to start voting for the next pope after Pope Francis’s funeral on Saturday. Only cardinals under the age of 80 can vote, and 108 of the 135 eligible voters were appointed by Francis. While some cardinals want to continue Francis’s focus on helping the poor and vulnerable, others are pushing for a return to traditional teachings and unity in the church. Trump’s pope comment may have been a joke, but the conclave to choose the real one is expected to be serious, and fast, possibly wrapped up in two or three days. Image source: File Trump moves fast but big promises still not done Donald Trump has been moving fast since returning to the White House. After 100 days, he’s made some big changes, but many of his promises are still not done. Trump says he already fixed inflation, but experts warn that his high tariffs on foreign goods could make prices rise again. He promised to lower energy bills by half, but for now, energy costs have stayed the same. On immigration, Trump has made a big impact. Illegal crossings from Mexico have dropped a lot, and deportations are up. Trump promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war quickly. That hasn’t happened. Fighting is still going on, and there is no peace deal yet. He also promised big tax cuts, like no taxes on tips and overtime pay, but none of those have passed yet. Trump has acted fast on cultural issues. He banned transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports, cut funding to some universities, and pardoned around 1,500 people who were involved in the January 6 Capitol riot. Trump also worked with Elon Musk to cut government jobs, but the savings are much smaller than they promised. In short, Trump has moved quickly on immigration and culture wars, but promises like cheaper energy, lower taxes, and peace in Ukraine are still not delivered, and it’s unclear if they will be. Image source: File Trump says Ukraine may give Russia part of its land US President Donald Trump says he thinks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready to give up Crimea to Russia, even though Zelenskyy said just last week that Crimea will always belong to Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in New Jersey on Sunday, Trump said: “Oh, I think so,” when asked if Zelenskyy was willing to give up the Black Sea region, which Russia seized in 2014, the Guardian reported. Zelenskyy has not yet responded to Trump’s latest comments. But last week, he clearly stated that Crimea is still “the property of the Ukrainian people.” Meanwhile, leaked US peace plans suggest Trump’s team is proposing that Russia keep the territories it captured, including Crimea. Germany’s defence minister called the US plan a “capitulation” and warned it was worse than anything Ukraine could have agreed to a year ago. Even so, Trump said after meeting Zelenskyy at the Vatican that he now has more sympathy for him. “He’s working hard. He wants to do something good for his country.” Trump also criticised Russia for launching new missile attacks after his peace ambassador met with Putin, saying he was “very disappointed.” When asked if he trusts Putin, Trump answered: “I’ll let you know in about two weeks.” Trump added that he believes a peace deal could be signed soon and claimed (without evidence) that the US has already sent Ukraine $350 billion in aid. On another front, Trump said there had been “a little bit” of progress in trade talks with China, despite Chinese officials saying no talks are happening. Image source: Donald Trump Truth Social Trump starts 2028 campaign even though third term is not allowed Donald Trump has started selling “Trump 2028” campaign hats, even though US law says he can’t run for a third term. The red cap, which looks like his usual “Make America Great Again” hat, now says “Trump 2028” and is being sold for $50 (around R1,000). According to the US Constitution, a person can only be elected president twice. Trump already won in 2016 and again in 2024, which means he shouldn’t be able to run again. But Trump told NBC that there may be “ways around” the rule. “I’m not joking,” he said. “A lot of people want me to do it.” Former Republican politician Adam Kinzinger says Trump is ignoring the rules and could create a big crisis if he refuses to listen to court decisions in the future, Daily Star reported. Trump’s second time in the White House has already caused economic problems, with high tariffs on imports and growing tension between countries. Stock markets have dropped, and trade wars have begun. Now, there are signs that Trump might try to calm things down but many believe the chaos isn’t over yet. Trump’s actions can affect the whole world, including South Africa. If he tries to stay in power longer than allowed, it could damage trust in democracy everywhere and hurt global trade and economic stability. Image source: File Trump still cares about Africa, says adviser after aid cuts US President Donald Trump still cares about Africa, even after cutting major aid programmes and raising tariffs, according to his adviser Massad Boulos. In an interview with the BBC, Boulos said Trump “highly values Africa and African people” and denied that the US is planning to close its embassies across the continent. But Trump’s actions have caused real problems. On his first day in office, Trump froze most US foreign aid, which has had a serious impact on health services in Africa. Many HIV treatment programmes were cut, and some countries may soon run out of HIV medication, according to the World Health Organization. Kenya, Nigeria and Lesotho are among the countries affected. The aid freeze also hit cholera clinics. In South Sudan, five children and three adults died after walking for hours to reach a clinic that had shut down. Boulos said the US is reviewing how aid is spent to make sure the money is not being wasted. “We want the money to go to the right places,” he said. He also confirmed that the US is interested in mining resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, especially minerals like lithium, which are used in electric car batteries. Trump’s trade policies have also hit Africa. He recently placed 50% tariffs on imports from countries like Lesotho, before putting those tariffs on hold for 90 days. Lesotho depends on US trade, especially in clothing and textiles. There are also worries about the future of AGOA — a special trade agreement between the US and African countries, first launched in 2000. Trump has not said if he will renew it, and experts think it might end soon. Image source: File Trump says China tariffs will drop but not go away US President Donald Trump says his very high tariffs on goods from China will be reduced but not removed completely. Right now, the US charges a 145% tariff on Chinese goods. China hit back with a 125% tariff on US products. This has started a trade war that’s shaken the global economy. Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said: “The tariffs will come down a lot — but they won’t go to zero,” the Guardian reported. His comments followed a warning from his treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who said the current situation can’t continue and both sides need to make changes. Trump said he still wants to keep good relations with China: “We’re doing fine with China. I think we’ll work well together.” The stock market went up after news of possible lower tariffs. China hasn’t officially replied yet, but their media called Trump’s tariffs unfair and warned other countries not to make trade deals that hurt China. Meanwhile, businesses around the world, including in South Africa, are worried that this trade fight will make things more expensive and slow down the economy. Both China and the US are huge trading partners for South Africa. If their trade war continues, it could mean fewer exports, job losses, and higher prices here at home. Image source: File Pope once told Trump ‘he’s not a Christian’ Pope Francis and Donald Trump never had a good relationship, and it all started with a wall. During Trump’s 2016 campaign, the Pope slammed his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico, saying: “A person who thinks only about building walls and not bridges is not Christian.” Trump didn’t take it well. He fired back, saying if ISIS ever attacked the Vatican, the Pope would’ve prayed for a president like him, Daily Star reported. The two later met in 2017 at the Vatican. Trump said it was a “fantastic meeting,” but photos told a different story, with the Pope looking miserable next to Trump’s big grin. Things didn’t get better. This year, just months before his death, the Pope again criticised Trump’s mass deportation policies, saying they were built on “force, not dignity” and “will end badly.” He also disagreed with Vice President JD Vance, who said people should look after their own families and countries before helping others. The Pope wrote: “Christian love is not just about looking after people close to you.” Pope Francis passed away on Monday 21 April at the age of 88. Trump is expected to attend his funeral on Saturday. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump says Russia and Ukraine might make a peace deal soon US President Donald Trump says Russia and Ukraine could reach a peace deal “this week”, but gave no details on what that would look like. Writing in all caps on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday, 20 April, Trump said: “HOPEFULLY RUSSIA AND UKRAINE WILL MAKE A DEAL THIS WEEK.” He added that if peace is reached, both countries could start doing “big business” with the US and “make a fortune.” The comment comes after a failed Easter ceasefire between the two countries. Russia said it would pause attacks for the holiday, but both sides have since accused each other of breaking the truce. Trump has recently said that both Ukraine and Russia need to compromise to end the war, which started in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. Any peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would affect global prices, from fuel to food. It could ease inflation and reduce pressure on SA’s economy, which has been hit hard by rising costs linked to the war. Image source: File Presidency says Trump won’t hold grudge against Jonas The presidency has defended sending Mcebisi Jonas to the US as South Africa’s new special envoy despite an old video where Jonas called Donald Trump a “racist, homophobe and narcissist”. The comments were made in 2020, when Jonas gave a public lecture as a private citizen, not as a government official. Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said on Wednesday: “At the time, Jonas was not representing the government. Those views were personal.” He added that Trump isn’t the type to hold grudges. “If he did, half his cabinet wouldn’t be working with him.” Jonas’ job is to fix SA’s diplomatic and trade relationship with the US, which has become tense. Trump expelled SA’s former ambassador Ebrahim Rasool after criticism of his administration, and recently threatened to boycott the G20 summit in South Africa. Magwenya said Rasool and Jonas are different cases — Rasool spoke while in office, while Jonas was just an activist at the time. Jonas also commented this week, saying: “These things happen. People move on.” Image source: File Trump’s trade war with China is bad news for South Africa South Africa got a 90-day break from Trump’s harsh tariffs, but experts say we’re still in trouble. That’s because Trump is now hitting China, one of South Africa’s biggest trading partners — with heavy taxes. And when China’s economy slows down, South Africa suffers too. China and the US buy over 18% of SA’s exports. If demand drops, it means fewer sales, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy here at home. Economist Maarten Ackerman told Mail & Guardian: “Even if the US doesn’t tax us directly, we’re still going to feel the pain.” SA’s farmers and food producers may need to find new markets fast, especially if US buyers stop ordering wine, fruit, or canned goods. To protect trade ties, President Ramaphosa has sent Mcebisi Jonas to Washington as a special envoy to deal with the growing crisis. Image source: File Trump blames Zelenskyy for war after deadly Russian attack Just days after 35 people were killed in Ukraine by Russian missiles — including two children — US President Donald Trump blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for helping to start the war. Speaking from the White House, Trump said that millions of people have died because of three people: Russia’s Vladimir Putin, former US president Joe Biden, and Zelenskyy. He said the war could have been stopped: “Biden could’ve stopped it, Zelenskyy could’ve stopped it, and Putin should never have started it,” Trump told reporters, Sky News reported. He also said Ukraine made a mistake by going to war with a much stronger country: “You don’t start a war with someone 20 times your size and hope people give you missiles,” he said. The comments came just after two Russian missiles hit the city of Sumy during a Palm Sunday celebration. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Ukraine this year, and over 100 people were injured. Zelenskyy has called for help from the world. Russia claimed it hit a military target but has shown no proof. Trump said he wants to end the war and stop people from dying: “All I want to do is stop the killing.” Image source: File White House claims Trump is healthy and fit to lead Donald Trump is “fully fit” to run the United States, even though he has high cholesterol, slightly high blood pressure, and a scar from a gunshot, according to a report from the White House doctor. The report came after Trump, who is 78 years old, went for his yearly health check-up. The doctor, Sean Barbella, said Trump is in good shape, both physically and mentally, and is taking medicine to manage his cholesterol. Trump’s cholesterol level is now 140, which is healthy. In 2018, it was over 220. His blood pressure is a little high at 128 over 74, but it’s not dangerous. The report also said Trump is up to date on all his vaccines, even though his health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has questioned vaccines in the past. Trump still has a scar on his ear from when he was shot at during a campaign rally last year. He survived, but one person died and others were injured. Trump told reporters after the exam: “I think it went well. They did every test you can imagine.” He also said he took a cognitive test to check his memory and thinking skills. He scored 30 out of 30, which means he passed with full marks. The test includes tasks like drawing a clock, remembering words, and naming animals. His heart rate was 62 beats per minute, which is normal for someone in good health. Image source: White House Tariff pause is no relief for South Africa South Africa has been given a 90-day break from Donald Trump’s harsh import tariffs but experts say it’s not really good news. The US dropped tariffs on many SA goods from 31% down to 10%, giving local exporters a bit of breathing room. But analysts and unions say this is just a tactic by Trump’s administration to force South Africa into signing trade deals that favour the US. Trade Minister Parks Tau confirmed that SA is included in the pause and said talks have already begun. But some tariffs, like the 25% tax on cars, steel, and aluminium, are still in place. Experts say the US is using tariffs as a negotiating weapon. Dr Frederich Kirsten, an economist, said: “It’s not about relief — it’s about pressure. The US now holds the cards,” he told The Citizen. Political analyst Sandile Swana warned that the US is trying to change global trade rules. “When you trade with the US, they want your country to play by American rules — even if it hurts your economy,” he said. Unions are worried too. Cosatu says 500,000 jobs in South Africa are linked to trade with the US. They called the 10% tax on agriculture “still too high” and warned that keeping cars at a 25% tariff could kill exports and cause job losses. The US tariff pause isn’t a gift — it’s a way to pressure SA into making deals that could hurt workers, weaken trade rules, and threaten jobs. With unemployment at around 32%, SA can’t afford to play along without a fight. Image source: File Lesotho made Trump’s shirts — now he’s taxing them 50% Some of Donald Trump’s fancy golf shirts were made in Lesotho, the same country he just hit with a huge 50% tariff. Trump’s branded shirts, made by golf legend Greg Norman’s clothing brand, have tags showing they were made in Lesotho. But now, because of Trump’s new import rules, clothing from Lesotho will cost 50% more to bring into the US. That’s bad news for Lesotho. The country depends on selling clothes to the US — it’s one of the biggest parts of its economy and supports 15,000 jobs, News24 reported. Before this, Lesotho’s clothes went into the US tariff-free under a deal called AGOA, which helps African countries trade with America. But that benefit is now gone. The reason? Trump says Lesotho has a trade “imbalance” with the US, mostly because of diamond sales. Greg Norman, who makes the shirts and supports Trump, once called him “a breath of fresh air.” Now, that air comes with a big bill. Lesotho’s economy is closely tied to South Africa. If thousands of jobs are lost there, it can affect trade, migration, and our shared economy. And if Trump is raising tariffs on neighbours like Lesotho, South Africa could face even more pressure — we’ve already been hit with a 30% tariff. Image source: File Trump’s tan taxed as tariff war hits his face Donald Trump’s new import taxes could end up hitting his own face — as prices rise on tanning products used to create his famous orange glow. Trump’s massive new tariffs came into effect on April 5, adding tariffs to thousands of foreign products. And that includes fake tan. Popular UK bronzer brand St. Tropez will now cost Americans 10% more, while Trump’s rumoured favourite face cream — Swiss brand Bronx Colors — will be hit with a 31% tariff. That means the president’s signature orange look could soon come with a higher price tag, Daily Star reported. Trump reportedly insists on 2 bottles of the Swiss concealer in his bedroom at all times. But now, thanks to his own tariffs, Americans will be paying more for beauty products, food, clothes, and electronics. Image source: @WhiteHouse Trump wants to ban sex toys and bring back child labour Donald Trump is trying to make it harder to buy sex toys — and easier for kids to work overnight. In Texas, a new law would force people to show their ID just to buy a vibrator online. Sellers who don’t check could face a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. Another proposed law would ban big shops like Walmart from selling sex toys at all — only strip clubs and sex shops would be allowed to sell them. The official term for a sex toy in Texas? An “obscene device” — including dildos and anything used to “stimulate genitals.” Sex expert Dr. Shamyra Howard said, “It turns something normal and healthy into something shameful.” Meanwhile, in Florida, lawmakers want to let 14-year-olds work night shifts, even on school days. One journalist put it simply: “Orgasms are out. Child labour is back.” Image source: File Zimbabwe cuts US tariffs as Africa faces trade war Zimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, says his country will drop all tariffs on goods coming from the US — just days after Donald Trump slapped an 18% tariff on Zimbabwe’s exports going into America. Mnangagwa says he wants to improve relations with the US and hopes this move will open the door to better trade. But many people say it’s a bad deal. Top journalist Hopewell Chin’ono says Zimbabwe is trying to “please” Trump in the hopes that US sanctions on Mnangagwa will be removed — but he calls it “a long shot.” Zimbabwe has been under some form of US sanctions for over 20 years, mainly due to human rights abuses and corruption. Biden removed the old sanctions last year but kept targeted sanctions on 11 people, including Mnangagwa himself. Now, Zimbabwe says it wants fair trade and friendly relations. But critics say the US will benefit far more from this decision than Zimbabwe will. Trade between the two countries is small — just over $110 million in 2024 — and most experts say scrapping tariffs won’t help Zimbabwe much. Mnangagwa, who is currently the chair of the SADC region, is also being criticised for acting alone. Some say he should be working with other African countries to respond to Trump as a group, not going solo. Trump has placed huge tariffs across Africa: Lesotho says it will send a team to the US to negotiate. Trump’s new tariffs are already hitting South Africa hard, with a 30% tax on goods going into the US. That could hurt our exports, lead to job losses, and make our economy even more unstable. And if other African countries start making one-sided deals, SA could be left behind. Image source: @edmnangagwa Donald Trump calls America a ‘healing patient’ Donald Trump says America is like a patient that just had surgery — and now it’s getting better, thanks to his new trade rules. On what he’s calling “Liberation Day”, Trump signed off on a big new tax (called a tariff) on goods coming into the US from other countries, including the UK, Japan, South Korea and South Africa. For example, goods from South Africa will now face a 30% tariff when they enter America. Even though many Americans are worried about prices going up, Trump celebrated on social media, writing: “THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING. THE PATIENT WILL BE STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER.” But not everyone is impressed. The UK government says it won’t react just yet, and Japan is deciding whether to fight back with its own tariffs. Experts also pointed out that some of Trump’s claims in his speech were wrong — like when he said American companies aren’t allowed to sell cars in other countries. To make things more awkward, Trump walked off the stage after his speech before signing the actual papers. A staff member had to bring him back to finish the job. When big countries like the US start taxing imports, it can cause global prices to rise. That means we might end up paying more here in South Africa for fuel, food, cars and other goods. Image source: File Elon Musk expected to leave Trump’s government soon Elon Musk is expected to leave his role in Donald Trump’s government in the next few weeks, according to insiders. Musk has been working as a special advisor in Trump’s new department called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But now, with Tesla sales dropping and more people criticising his influence in politics, Musk is stepping back to focus on his businesses. His time as a “special government employee” is set to end around May or June. At a press briefing, Trump said: “At some point, he’s going back. I’d keep him as long as I can — he’s very smart.” But behind the scenes, there’s been trouble. Some people in Trump’s team say Musk’s behaviour has become difficult to manage. His surprise announcements and posts on social media have caused problems, and many in the White House have been frustrated. Musk has also become a political problem. He recently spent millions supporting a judge in an American election — but the judge lost badly. His link to Trump is also hurting Tesla, as some customers are now avoiding the brand. Tesla’s share price has dropped, and some experts say Musk is turning people away with his behaviour. Trump has also started to distance himself from DOGE, the government project Musk created to “cut waste.” Some say it caused more confusion than results. Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, and he’s one of the most powerful people in the world. His role in the US government affects decisions about technology, business, and even space. If Musk steps away from politics, it could change how the US works with other countries — including South Africa. Image source: @POTUS Trump to announce new taxes on imports Donald Trump is set to make a big announcement on Wednesday that could affect prices around the world — including in South Africa. He’s calling it “Liberation Day”, and he plans to add new taxes (called tariffs) on goods coming into the United States from other countries. That means anything the US buys from overseas — like cars, clothes, electronics, oil, and food — could be taxed more. Trump says he’s doing this to protect American businesses and workers, and to punish countries he thinks have taken advantage of the US for years. Reports say Trump may add: These new tariffs would start right away — and many people are worried. Business leaders in the US say the extra taxes will make things more expensive for them, and they’ll likely raise prices for customers to make up for it. That could lead to a rise in the cost of living in many countries. The global stock market has already dropped, and experts say Trump’s plan could help cause a worldwide recession — which means job losses, rising prices, and slower trade. If prices go up in the US and Europe, South Africans could feel it too. We might pay more for things we import, like petrol, electronics and food. If global trade slows down, South African businesses could lose money — and that puts jobs at risk. Image source: File Trump says he’s not joking about a third term as president Donald Trump has suggested he could try to stay in the White House for a third term, despite the US Constitution saying that’s not allowed. Speaking in an interview, the 78-year-old president said “a lot of people want me to do it,” and hinted that his vice president JD Vance could take over as president — and then step down so Trump could return. “I’m not joking,” Trump said. “There are ways you could do it.” Under US law, no president can be elected more than twice. But Trump’s latest comments have experts worried. Former congressman David Jolly warned: “If he says he’s not ruling it out, we should take it seriously.” Legal experts say it’s likely just political theatre — but with Trump, anything is possible. If Trump starts a trade war, it could make everyday things more expensive here in South Africa. Our economy is connected to the global market, so if prices go up in the US and Europe, we feel it too. And if Trump finds a way to stay in power longer than the law allows, it could encourage other world leaders to try the same — which is bad news for democracy everywhere. Image source: @POTUS ‘Pissed off’ Trump warns Putin to back off or face tariffs Donald Trump says he’s “very angry” and “pissed off” with Russian president Vladimir Putin and now he’s threatening major new oil tariffs to force a peace deal in Ukraine. The outburst came after Putin suggested Ukraine should kick out president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of a ceasefire agreement — something Trump called a “step in the wrong direction.” Speaking to NBC News, Trump said: “If Russia and I can’t make a deal to stop the bloodshed, and I think it’s Russia’s fault — which it might be — I’ll hit them with massive tariffs. No more Russian oil in the US. No business with countries that buy it. A 25 to 50% tariff.” Trump has shifted from his previously soft tone on Putin to something more aggressive, even though he insists they still have a “good relationship.” His latest comments come as peace talks drag on with no clear end in sight. Russia says negotiations could stretch into 2026 and continues to demand the lifting of sanctions as a condition for any ceasefire. Meanwhile, Russia continues to bomb Ukrainian cities. A drone strike on Kharkiv this weekend killed two people and injured 35, including patients in a military hospital. A wider or longer war in Ukraine keeps global fuel prices high, food costs rising, and world markets unstable. If Trump gets tough on Russia, it could shake up oil supplies — and the impact will reach South African wallets fast. Image source: File Trump calls himself the fertilisation president Donald Trump has given himself a strange new nickname: “the fertilisation president.” He was speaking at the White House during a Women’s History Month event when he started talking about helping more women access IVF (in vitro fertilisation) — a medical process that helps people have babies. “There will be tremendous goodies in the bag for women,” Trump said. Then he added: “I’ll be known as the fertilisation president — and that’s OK.” People in the room laughed, and Trump smiled: “Actually, I like it. I’ve been called worse.” Trump has been trying to win over more women voters by promising that the government will help pay for fertility treatments. He also made headlines earlier this year when he called himself “the father of IVF,” even though he admitted he didn’t know much about it until recently. Image source: File Trump picks far-right media boss as new US ambassador to SA US President Donald Trump has nominated Brent Bozell — a hardcore conservative media figure — as America’s new ambassador to South Africa. Bozell is best known for founding the Media Research Center, a group that attacks what it calls “liberal bias” in the US media. Trump made the announcement on his social media account, calling Bozell “fearless” and praising his “extraordinary experience.” “Brent brings fearless tenacity, extraordinary experience, and vast knowledge to a Nation that desperately needs it,” Trump wrote. “Congratulations Brent!” Bozell could replace Reuben Brigety, who resigned in January after several rocky months in Pretoria. His nomination was confirmed this week in a formal note sent to the US Senate. This comes as relations between the US and South Africa remain tense, with Trump cutting funding and booting SA’s ambassador Ebrahim Rasool out of Washington earlier this month. Bozell is a known Trump loyalist who’s been part of the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement. Some insiders say this appointment is less about diplomacy — and more about messaging. Brent Bozell is not a diplomat — he’s a political activist who supports Trump’s views and often attacks anyone who disagrees. His appointment means the US may take a tougher, more aggressive approach toward South Africa. That could make it harder for our government to work with the US on things like trade, diplomacy, and international issues like Ukraine or Gaza. Image source: @SenMikeLee Heavyweight clash at White House ends with missing belt Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed this week that he doesn’t know what happened to the WBC championship belt he brought to the White House months ago as a gift for Donald Trump. The belt, given to him by heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk after beating Tyson Fury, was meant as a peace offering. But instead of handing it over, Zelenskyy pulled out a folder of disturbing war photos showing tortured Ukrainian soldiers — and the meeting turned into a political punch-up. Trump, who had already called Zelenskyy a dictator, exploded on camera. “You’re gambling with World War III,” he snapped. Zelenskyy now says he left the belt on a side table and never saw it again. “Maybe it’s still sitting there,” he told Time magazine this week. Reports say a staffer moved it to Trump’s private dining room — where it may now be collecting dust next to tomato sauce bottles and golf trophies. Zelenskyy says he doesn’t regret showing the photos instead of the belt. “He has kids. He should feel what we feel,” he said. “But yeah… the conversation went in a different direction.” Image source: File Trump’s team accidentally texts war plans to journalist Top Trump officials have accidentally leaked secret US war plans in a messaging app group chat — by including a journalist in the conversation. The group, made up of senior figures like Vice President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was discussing attacks on Yemen when they mistakenly added Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg. Goldberg says he was shocked to see real-time details of the military operation, including names of officials and sensitive tactics. “I thought it was a prank,” he said. “But the attack happened exactly as they planned it.” The Trump administration has confirmed the breach but is trying to downplay the damage. Hegseth even told reporters, “Nobody was texting war plans.” Goldberg hit back: “That’s a lie. He was.” If Trump’s top officials can’t keep their own war plans private, it puts global security at risk. Countries like South Africa often work with the US on trade, security, and international cooperation. But if the US keeps making mistakes like this, it’s harder to trust them. Image source: @POTUS Rasool says ‘don’t replace me with a white ambassador’ Former ambassador Ebrahim Rasool has told President Cyril Ramaphosa not to choose a white replacement just to please Donald Trump. Speaking at a homecoming rally in Cape Town on Sunday, Rasool told ANC supporters that South Africa must fix its relationship with the US but without sacrificing its values. “We can’t think that just because America has a white president, we need a white ambassador,” he said. “We need someone who can rebuild ties, but still stand strong for what we believe in.” Rasool was kicked out of the US last week after Trump’s government accused him of being disrespectful. Now, names like deputy minister Andries Nel and former DA leader Tony Leon are being floated as possible replacements but the presidency says there’s no rush. Rasool also called for a new kind of diplomacy — one based on Ubuntu. “Ubuntu diplomacy is not about lying to protect your country or flattering your host,” he said. “It’s about telling the truth with respect, standing your ground, and keeping your dignity.” The next ambassador will shape how South Africa navigates a tough relationship with Trump’s US. That choice will say a lot about whether we stand firm — or bend under pressure. Image source: File France wants the Statue of Liberty back French leaders are demanding that the United States give back the Statue of Liberty — all because of Donald Trump. French politician Raphaël Glucksmann says the statue, which was gifted to the US 140 years ago, no longer belongs there. He says Trump has “sided with tyrants” and no longer represents the values the statue stands for. “We gave it to you as a symbol of freedom,” Glucksmann said. “But if you’ve chosen to support dictators and silence scientists, then we want our gift back.” The Trump administration hit back hard, saying the statue is going nowhere. A White House spokesperson said France should be grateful to the US for helping them win World War II and added that “if it wasn’t for America, they’d be speaking German.” Even Australia’s former Prime Minister jumped in, reminding everyone that France once helped America fight the British in its own war for independence. This may sound like political theatre but it shows how Trump’s actions are damaging US relationships around the world. As America isolates itself, smaller countries like South Africa feel the knock-on effects in trade, global funding, and foreign policy influence. Image source: File Trump says Rasool must leave the US by Friday South Africa’s ambassador to the US, Ebrahim Rasool, has just days to clear out his office and leave America after being declared “persona non grata” by the Trump administration. The diplomatic bombshell dropped when Secretary of State Marco Rubio blasted Rasool as a “race-baiting politician who hates President Trump” in a social media post after the ambassador discussed white Americans becoming a minority. Rasool’s diplomatic privileges expired Monday, and he must be out of the country by Friday. President Ramaphosa is trying to downplay the crisis, calling it a “hiccup” and promising to engage “with deep respect” for Trump, but this comes right after Trump cut funding to South Africa over alleged “anti-white policies.” As our top diplomat gets ready to fly home, South Africans should watch closely – when ambassadors get expelled, serious economic and political fallout usually follows. Image source: SA Embassy Is Trump just Musk’s babysitter now? New photos from the White House have people asking: who’s really in charge — Donald Trump or Elon Musk? The pictures show Trump walking next to Musk’s four-year-old son while Musk walks ahead, talking to his staff. In one photo, Trump is even seen helping the boy — nicknamed “Lil X” — onto the presidential helicopter. Social media had a field day. “Trump finally got a real job — he’s Lil X’s nanny now,” one person joked. Another said: “Imagine being the president but spending your day babysitting a billionaire’s child.” Some people even asked, “Does this kid live at the White House now?” One user replied: “Of course he does — he’s the real president!” Musk posted one of the photos himself, calling it “a happy picture.” But many people noticed something else: Musk walking ahead like the boss, while Trump trails behind with the child. “It really shows who has the power,” one person wrote. Since Trump appointed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (called DOGE), Musk has become one of the most powerful people in Washington. Musk was born in Pretoria and now he’s influencing major decisions in the US. That could affect South Africa too, from how we use social media and tech to deals around space, green energy and trade. If Musk is the one calling the shots, his choices could impact jobs, prices, and policies here at home. Image source: @POTUS Putin “agrees” to Trump’s ceasefire plan but with a catch Putin just said yes to Trump’s 30-day ceasefire plan for Ukraine, but don’t get too excited. While thanking Trump for “regulating the conflict,” Putin added he has “a lot of questions” and any deal must “lead to long-term peace” – Putin-speak for getting what he wants. The Russian leader couldn’t help boasting that his forces “are on the offensive everywhere” and warned Ukrainian troops they must “surrender or die.” Experts think Putin’s agreement comes with hidden conditions and might just be playing nice with Trump, who has now restored military aid to Ukraine after Zelenskyy agreed to ceasefire talks. Why should South Africans care? Because global conflicts affect our economy directly – from higher food prices to unstable markets. Plus, watching Trump broker deals between Russia and Ukraine shows how he handles international problems – a preview of what other countries (including ours) might face. Image source: File Trump’s right hand tells a story the White House won’t explain Something strange is going on with Trump’s hand. A dark mark keeps showing up in photos – most recently during his meeting with Ireland’s leader. The White House claims it’s just from Trump shaking too many hands. But medical experts aren’t buying it. Dr. Anatalia Moore, a skin specialist, says normal handshakes don’t cause bruises like that, Daily Star reported. She thinks it might be from a medical procedure where doctors put a drip in his hand. She also points out that at 78, Trump could bruise more easily from just bumping into things, as older people often have balance issues and their bodies heal slower. While it might just be makeup or a minor bruise, these marks are raising questions about the president’s health – something worth watching as his physical condition could affect his decisions on South Africa and other global issues. Image source: @POTUS Trump opens door for Afrikaner resettlement in America It’s official – the US is now actively working to bring Afrikaner South Africans to America as refugees. The US Embassy just confirmed they’re reviewing applications and will contact people who’ve already applied. This isn’t just Trump talking anymore – it’s becoming real policy. Trump claims South Africa is “confiscating” white farmers’ land “without compensation” after Ramaphosa signed the Expropriation Act. Most experts say this isn’t true, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from offering “a rapid pathway to citizenship” for these farmers. About 1,500 Afrikaners have already gathered outside the US Embassy in Pretoria to thank Trump for his support. Meanwhile, our government refuses to get into a shouting match with Trump, with Ramaphosa’s spokesperson saying South Africa won’t engage in “counterproductive megaphone diplomacy.” The big question now: How many farmers will actually pack up and leave? And what would that mean for our farms, food security, and race relations? Image source: File Trump’s market panic and what it means for South Africa By Dylan Bettencourt The US stock market just took a nasty dive after Trump twice dodged questions about a recession. Why should you care? Because when America sneezes, South Africa catches a cold. Trump’s chaos affects us directly: – When global markets panic, the Rand usually weakens – Weaker Rand = more expensive imports = higher prices at the shops – Foreign investors get nervous about putting money in countries like ours – Our exports become less valuable if America’s economy slows down Trump admitted his policies might cause economic “pain” before things get better. His own team is now rushing to calm markets, promising there won’t be a recession. For South Africans already struggling with high prices, Trump’s unpredictable style is the last thing we need. The big question: Will Trump back down like he did with Canada and Mexico, or stick to his disruptive plans? Either way, as one expert warned: “Good luck in this challenging time.” Image source: File De Klerk foundation rejects Trump’s farmer ‘rescue’ plan By Dylan Bettencourt The FW de Klerk Foundation has rejected Trump’s offer to give US citizenship to white South African farmers. Their message? Trump’s plan is based on “disinformation and cheap politics” with “no basis in truth.” Christo van der Rheede put it simply: “The challenges we face in South Africa aren’t just white people’s problems. We’re all affected by crime, unemployment and bad policies.” The Foundation warns that Trump’s actions will hurt South Africa’s economy and farming industry. They also connect Trump’s move to the rise of “ethnic nationalism” worldwide, suggesting right-wing groups are using this to attack South Africa’s non-racial democracy established in 1994. Meanwhile, our government won’t engage in “megaphone diplomacy” – choosing to ignore Trump’s social media outbursts rather than dignify them with a response. Image source: File Health Minister says Trump ‘doesn’t’ owe us a cent’ By Dylan Bettencourt Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said “Trump doesn’t owe South Africa any cent whatsoever” after the US president cut R8 billion in HIV/AIDS funding. Instead of complaining, he called on South Africa to “stand on our own” and revealed he’s already talking to other donors like the Gates Foundation to replace Trump’s money. EFF’s Malema had a different take, claiming the cuts are “Israel’s revenge” for South Africa’s support of Palestine. He also warned that land reform will continue “whether they like it or not.” Motsoaledi couldn’t resist taking a jab at right-wing group Solidarity’s recent White House visit, distinguishing them from the COVID Solidarity Fund that’s helping fill funding gaps. The bottom line for South Africans living with HIV? The political blame game won’t matter if someone doesn’t step up to save the program that employs 15,000 healthcare workers and keeps millions of patients alive. Image source: @MYANC Trump says ‘nobody has ever heard of’ Lesotho Trump just took a cheap shot at our neighbor Lesotho in his Congress speech, calling it a country “nobody has ever heard of” while Republican lawmakers laughed along. Why? He was defending his foreign aid cuts, specifically “$8 million for LGBTQI+” in Lesotho – though local LGBTQ groups say they never got this money. Lesotho’s Foreign Minister is angry, calling the comments “shocking” and promising to send a formal protest to Washington. The real impact? Lesotho has the world’s second-highest HIV rate, and Trump’s funding cuts threaten healthcare programs that people on both sides of the border rely on. For South Africans, it’s perhaps a reminder of how Trump sees African nations – as jokes, not partners. Image source: @POTUS Zelenskyy folds after Trump cuts military aid By Dylan Bettencourt Trump just announced he’s got a letter from Zelenskyy saying Ukraine is “ready to come to the negotiating table” – quite the U-turn after last week’s White House showdown. After getting his military aid cut off, Zelenskyy’s now saying he wants to “make things right” and is ready “any time and in any convenient format” to sign that minerals deal he previously walked away from. Trump’s also claiming he’s had “serious discussions with Russia” and received “strong signals they’re ready for peace.” For South Africans, this drama is worth watching closely. What happens when a superpower suddenly changes sides? We’re seeing countries that depend on American support scrambling to adjust. In Trump’s world, yesterday’s allies can become today’s bargaining chips – a lesson that applies just as much to Pretoria as it does to Kyiv. Image source: File Trump leaves Ukraine stranded By Dylan Bettencourt Trump just pulled the plug on Ukraine’s military aid after publicly arguing with Zelenskyy. No more weapons, no more ammo – not even stuff that’s already on ships heading there. It’s the same tactic he used when cutting South Africa’s HIV funding. One day you’ve got support, the next you don’t. When Zelenskyy dared say peace might be “very, very far away,” Trump didn’t hold back: the Ukrainian president “won’t be around very long” unless he plays ball. The message for countries like ours is crystal clear: in Trump’s world, you either give him what he wants or he’ll pull the rug out from under you – no warning, no negotiations. So when South African ministers next fly to Washington, they’d better have more than just goodwill in their briefcases. In Trumpland, it’s deal or no deal. Image source: File Trump vs Zelensky fight in White House Smackdown By Dylan Bettencourt Trump and Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy argued live on TV and SA analyst Sandile Swana says it’s a whole new ballgame. Gone are the days of friendly military aid. Trump’s message was crystal clear: “No minerals, no protection.” While Zelensky talked about friendship, Trump talked about business – leaving the Ukrainian leader visibly stunned. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Association of South Africa is urging us not to abandon Ukraine, warning that Putin won’t stop his expansion plans anytime soon. Trump’s “my way or the highway” approach could be coming to an international relationship near you. US ambassador quits as SA relations hit rock bottom By Dylan Bettencourt In the latest Trump-era shake-up, Dana Brown, America’s acting ambassador to South Africa, has suddenly resigned. This exit happens just as relations hit rock bottom, with Trump cutting all funding to South Africa and offering refugee status to Afrikaner farmers. The timing couldn’t be worse for South Africans. With no permanent US ambassador since January and Brown now leaving in March, our diplomatic channel to America is running on skeleton staff just when we need it most. Meanwhile, Afrikaner lobby groups AfriForum and Solidarity flew to the White House seeking “humanitarian assistance” – a move Ramaphosa slammed as “sowing divisions.” For ordinary South Africans, this diplomatic cold war threatens everything from healthcare funding to trade relations, showing how Trump’s personal politics directly impacts our national interests. Image source: US Embassy Trump axes USAID funding for HIV By Dylan Bettencourt Trump on Thursday pulled the plug on R8.1 billion in HIV funding, telling South African organisations to “immediately cease all activities.” He sent just letters saying the programs “aren’t aligned with Agency priorities.” This isn’t just American politics – it’s about your friend, neighbour or family member who depends on these services. Some 8 million South Africans rely on HIV treatment programs, and these cuts threaten real lives in our communities. While the government scrambles for a response, healthcare workers are losing jobs and vulnerable patients are left hanging. From sex workers to pregnant moms, the impact hits hardest on those who need help most.As one health worker put it to Bhekisasa: “This isn’t just a funding cut – it’s a betrayal.” Image source: File Gauteng minister copies Elon Musk strategy By Zukile Majova The Gauteng health department is checking if all 85,642 people on its payroll are real workers who actually show up for work. The department has already frozen the salaries of 66 workers who haven’t come forward to prove they exist. Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko says her department can’t waste money paying ghost workers when hospitals need more staff and patients need care. “We have limited resources at our disposal and cannot afford to waste money on ghost workers while hundreds of healthcare workers are looking for employment and thousands of people require access to healthcare services,” she said. The department’s new Ziveze (Reveal Yourself) Campaign follows a similar move by Elon Musk in America. Musk emailed US government workers asking them to prove what work they’ve done. The billionaire head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency said: “All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” In Gauteng, workers must go to their HR office to prove they are real employees. Those who don’t show up risk losing their jobs and could face criminal charges. So far, 23,789 workers still need to prove they exist. Image source: @NkomoNomantu Ukraine fights back against Trump’s mineral grab By Rorisang Modiba Trump’s got Zelenskyy flying to Washington on Friday to sign a deal over Ukraine’s precious minerals. Trump initially wanted a massive $500bn chunk of Ukraine’s resources – imagine someone trying that with our platinum! Much like how South Africans get nervous when foreign companies eye our mineral wealth, Ukrainians weren’t having it. Zelenskyy flat-out refused to sign something “10 generations would have to repay.” Now, they’ve settled on sharing ownership instead – sound familiar? It’s the same dance our government does with mining giants over our resources. As global powers scramble for these battery metals and rare earths, South Africa should watch closely. This is exactly the kind of pressure our mineral-rich country could face next. Image source: File © Copyright Scrolla.Africa

Title: Chainlink Acknowledged By The White House As Key Player In Crypto Infrastructure

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The White House has officially recognized Chainlink (LINK) as an essential component of the digital asset ecosystem. This acknowledgment comes from the recently published Digital Asset Report, which emphasizes the importance of decentralized oracles in the functioning of stablecoins and tokenized assets. Market expert Quinten Francois highlighted this recognition on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), stating, “WHITE HOUSE JUST MENTIONED CHAINLINK.” The report underscores how oracles act as a bridge connecting external data sources to blockchain networks, enabling smart contracts to execute agreements based on real-world events and prices. This functionality is crucial for decentralized applications (dApps) that facilitate a range of financial activities, including trading, lending, and earning rewards. Chainlink’s role becomes even more vital in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), where dApps often serve as cross-chain bridges, allowing assets to move seamlessly between different blockchain networks. These wrapped assets, which exist on one chain but are represented on another, illustrate the growing complexity and interconnectivity of the blockchain ecosystem. Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, responded positively to the White House’s endorsement, expressing his appreciation for the administration’s commitment to advancing the blockchain industry. Nazarov noted that Chainlink’s recognition represents a critical moment for both the industry and the broader US financial system. Chainlink’s co-founder further noted: I think the president’s (Trump) clear placing of our industry as a national priority will be seen as a critical and historic moment for our industry and for the United States financial system’s role globally. Nazarov distinguished the report’s focus on oracles, particularly the Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which according to his assessment highlights the innovative work being done by the Chainlink community to enhance smart contract capabilities. Beyond its focus on Chainlink, the White House report outlines various recommendations aimed at structuring cryptocurrency markets and clarifying the regulatory roles of federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). An earlier report by Bitcoinist also notes that the White House encourages Congress to implement laws that embrace decentralized finance technologies, recognizing their potential to reshape traditional finance. Despite the optimism surrounding these developments, some industry leaders had anticipated further details regarding a federal Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, a topic notably absent from the report. During a press briefing, a White House official mentioned that infrastructure for this initiative is currently being developed, with more information expected in the near future. Despite this development, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, remained unfazed, currently trading at $17.80. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading 66% below its record high of $52.

July 31, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: AIR FRANCE - KLM AIR FRANCE - KLM xx July 31, 2025 FY 2025 outlook reconfirmed For 2025 the Group retains an agile approach given the current uncertainty and expects: Commenting on the results, Mr. Benjamin Smith, Group CEO, said: “Air France-KLM delivered a solid second quarter, with revenue growth and improved margins, reflecting the strength of our diversified network and the disciplined execution of our strategy. We are advancing premiumization, pushing the boundaries of aspirational travel with enhanced products and services, while progressing on the renewal of our fleet with next-generation aircraft, in line with our sustainability efforts. At the same time, we are reinforcing global connectivity through key partnerships and joint ventures in strategic areas, and, in early July, we initiated proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS. This marks a major step to strengthen our position in Northern Europe and expand our network reach. Although the external environment remains complex, Air France-KLM continues to demonstrate its resilience and is well positioned to achieve its targets. I want to thank all our teams for their continued commitment — their dedication is what makes this performance possible.” Solid Group unit revenue performance *IFRS Operating free cash flow corrected from the repayment of deferred social charges, pensions contributions and wage taxes granted during the Covid period and payment of lease debt and interests paid and received Operating result improvement driven by unit revenue development and fuel price evolution In the second quarter of 2025, Air France-KLM welcomed 27.3 million passengers which is 5.9% above last year. As capacity and traffic increased by 4.2%, the load factor remained stable at 87.8%. The Group unit revenue per ASK was up 2.4% year-on-year at constant currency, driven by strong yield performance in Network (passenger and cargo) and Transavia. Passenger yields were strong on the North Atlantic, despite the tariff turbulence, while also increasing in Asia & Middle East, Latin America and led by the premium cabins. Cargo continued to benefit from traffic out of Asia with unit revenues per ATK up 2.6% at constant currency. The operating result rose €223 million year-on-year to €736 million, with a margin of 8.7%. This performance was driven by a €176 million increase in unit revenues across the passenger network, Cargo and Transavia while unit costs including fuel remained broadly stable. Q2 unit cost1 was up 2.7% as a consequence of the below elements: Cash In the second quarter Air France/Air France-KLM and KLM extended both their Revolving Credit Facilities (RCF) until 2029. The total amount of the Group RCFs is maintained at €2.4 billion, and these facilities are currently undrawn. Through this transaction, Air France-KLM, Air France and KLM are extending the average maturity of available resources, in line with the Group's policy of careful liquidity management. For the first half of the year, the Group reported a positive operating free cash flow of €1,285 million, supported mainly by a favorable working capital from ticket sales, although impacted by the deferrals inherited from the pandemic which amounted to €244 million. Net capex amounted to €1.742 million. Recurring adjusted operating free cash flow2 reached €723 million, an increase of €589 million year-on-year. The operating free cash flow stood at €1.3 billion, partly offset by almost €1.2 billion in new and modified lease debt driven by fleet renewal and extension of current leases to cover delivery delays. As a consequence net debt decreased to €7.1 billion, down €197 million. The leverage ratio stood at 1.5x in line with the Group’s ambition of 1.5x to 2.0x. The level of cash at hand remains high and above the targeted level of €6 billion to €8 billion. At the end of June, the cash at hand stood at €9.4 billion, stable versus the end of 2024. During the first half year of 2025, the following transactions took place: The net proceeds of the issue of the Hybrid Bonds is used by the Company for refinancing of existing subordinated instruments within the Group. This issue enables the Group to simplify its balance sheet and optimize its cost of financing while maintaining financial flexibility. The Group’s strategy is to reduce the stock of subordinated instruments on its balance sheet. In July (after the Q2 closing) Air France-KLM fully redeemed the perpetual bonds issued in July 2022 for an amount of €500 million. These bonds were issued by an operating affiliate of Air France, that owns a pool of spare engines dedicated to the airline’s Engineering and Maintenance activities and was fully subscribed by Apollo affiliated entities. The transaction three years ago supported Air France-KLM in its trajectory to come back to a positive equity position under IFRS and the Group thanks Apollo for the smooth partnership during this trajectory. Rating update FY 2025 outlook reconfirmed For 2025 the Group retains an agile approach given the current uncertainty and expects: Sustainability Sustainability is a collective responsibility, and Air France- KLM is committed to play its role. The Group supports the adoption of ambitious environmental targets, advocating for an industry- wide transformation that ensures a global level playing field. Fleet Renewal In line with its fleet renewal strategy, Air France-KLM continues to take delivery of new generation aircraft such as Airbus A350s, B787-10, A320neo family aircraft, A220s, Embraer 195-E2s. These new generation aircraft consume up to 25% less fuel per passenger km and reduce the noise footprint by up to 63% compared to the previous generation aircraft they replace. At the end of June 2025, the Group had 30% of its fleet composed of new generation aircraft. The Group aims to get up to 80% of its fleet with new generation aircraft by 2030. SAF The Air France-KLM Group is working on increasing SAF demand and usage, driving its growth and development worldwide. On April 23, 2025, the Carb Aéro call for projects award ceremony was held at Air France’s headquarters at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. This initiative, part of the France 2030 investment program, aims to support the emergence of an e-SAF (synthetic drop-in fuel substitute to conventional fossil-based jet fuel) sector — a key technology in achieving the decarbonization goals of the aviation industry. As an airline group fully committed to decarbonizing its industry, Air France-KLM proudly hosted this event and reaffirmed its support for the development of an industrial ecosystem for sustainable fuel production in France — contributing to the country’s energy sovereignty and competitiveness. In June 2025, on the occasion of the Paris Air Show, Air France signed the SAF component of the New Energy Systems sector contract with the French government and industry partners. In the presence of Mr. Eric Lombard (Minister of Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty), Mr. Marc Ferracci (Minister for Industry and Energy), Mr. Philippe Tabarot (Minister for Transport) and Nathalie Delattre (Minister for Tourism), four main objectives were identified: In parallel, the Air France-KLM Group also signed an agreement with Airbus, enabling the aircraft manufacturer’s employees to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel by supporting SAF production. This voluntary commitment is part of the Air France-KLM “Corporate SAF” program and aims to develop a transparent, traceable, and verifiable SAF offering. GHG emissions per RTK (revenue ton-kilometer) At the end of June 2025, the indicator was 924 gCO₂eq/RTK6, which represents a 1.5% reduction compared to end of June 2024. Air France-KLM and its airlines are facing some headwinds to their GHG intensity reduction due to unforeseen and external events beyond the Group’s control, including delays in executing the fleet renewal plan due to constraints in the supply chain; engine issues with part of its new generation aircraft fleet (such as several Airbus A220’s) not allowing the Group to operate them to their maximum capacity; higher fuel consumption due to longer flight time on certain routes caused by different geopolitical circumstances. Given above headwinds it is unlikely that the 2025 target of the Sustainability Linked Bond will be reached. Post quarter events Air France-KLM to initiate proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS On the 4th of July 2025, Air France-KLM announced that it will initiate proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS. The Group currently holds a 19.9% stake in the Scandinavian carrier and since the summer of 2024, it has implemented a commercial cooperation between SAS, Air France and KLM in the form of extended code-share and interline agreements, further strengthened by SAS joining the SkyTeam alliance. Provided all the necessary conditions are met, Air France-KLM would fully acquire the stakes held by Castlelake and Lind Invest, bringing its own stake to 60.5%. The Danish State would retain its 26.4% stake in SAS and its seats on the Board of Directors. The value of Air France-KLM’s contemplated investment in SAS would be determined at closing, based on SAS’s latest financial performance – including EBITDA and Net Debt. This transaction would be in line with the Group’s medium-term financial outlook. Business review Network result Compared to the second quarter of 2024, total revenues increased by +4.6% to €6,937 million. The operating result reached €666 million up €190 million year-on-year at constant currency driven by higher revenues and fuel price reduction. The operating margin improved to 9.6%, an increase of 2.9 point compared to 2024. Passenger network delivers solid Q2 performance with Premium cabin strength and yield gains During the second quarter of 2025, capacity in Available Seat Kilometers (ASK) was 2.8% higher than last year. Traffic growth of +2.9% has led to a stable load factor at 87.4%. Yield at constant currency showed strong performance, up 2.8%, leading to a unit revenue of 2.8% year-on-year at constant currency. During the second quarter we observed the following trends in: North Atlantic Despite a 5% capacity growth, unit revenue increased by 5% driven by positive front cabin yield development while Economy cabin yield declined year-on-year. June performance was affected by the Middle East conflict. Latin America Unit revenue grew on the back of strong yield (+6.1%), while load factor was slightly up at 91% and capacity increased by 5.6%. Asia & Middle East Growth was mainly supported by Asia while Middle East capacity was impacted by geopolitical tensions. Strong performance on Japan, Korea & South-East Asia. Unit revenue in the region was up 6%, supported by strong yield development while load factor remained stable at 89%. Caribbean & Indian Ocean A strong industry wide capacity increase (Air France-KLM: +5%) led to a more competitive fare environment and 2% decline in unit revenue. AfricaCapacity, load factor and yield remained broadly stable year-on-year. Short and Medium-haul Overall, capacity rose 5%, with a broadly stable load factor at 85% and yield remaining flat. The focus was on stimulating local traffic and volumes to support additional capacity. In the first half of the year, revenue from the premium segment grew by 11% year-on-year, increasing its contribution to passenger network revenue to 28.7%, up from 27.3% in the same period last year. This positive trend was observed across all regions. The introduction of the new La Première cabin, which further strengthened the premium offering, generated great exposure. On the Transatlantic network, the premium revenue share remained broadly stable, above 41%. Premium and Premium Comfort continued its strong momentum with a 27% year-on-year increase, bringing its share in the passenger network revenue to 8.1%, compared to 6.7% in the first half year of 2024. Cargo: robust performance During the second quarter of 2025, capacity in Available Ton Kilometers (ATK) rose 1.4% year-on-year. Full freighter capacity was negatively impacted by longer-than-expected maintenance. Traffic grew 1.1% slightly below capacity growth keeping the load factor broadly stable at 45.5%. Together with a 3% increase in yield, unit revenue per ATK increased by 2.6% at constant currency. In June, KLM completed the cutover from the old IT systems to the new system which was already done last year by Air France. During the WACA (World Air Cargo Awards) 2025, Air France-KLM Cargo was declared Best European Airline. The award won by Air France-KLM Cargo is a recognition for airlines that have demonstrated outstanding performance and consistently provide excellent service, show leadership, and contribute to the development of the air cargo sector, globally or in their region. Transavia: Revenue growth and yield improvement support Q2 results amid cost pressures Transavia’s capacity in available seat kilometers grew 11.4%, while traffic increased by 11.2%, resulting in a broadly stable load factor. Unit revenue was up +2.9%, supported by positive yield development at both Transavia France and the Netherlands. However, Transavia Netherlands faced increased competition, partly due to redirected capacity from Middle East towards other European destinations, putting the unit revenues under pressure. Also the increase in Schiphol tariffs in combination with the increase of the ticket tax last year which is resulting in higher ticket prices was pushing travelers to airports in Germany. In France performance was affected by a strike that led to significant customer compensations. Overall, unit cost increased by 4.9% despite lower fuel prices, mainly due to an increase in wet leases activity for Transavia the Netherlands. Maintenance business: double digit growth and improved operating margin sssss The maintenance segment continued its strong growth in Q2 2025 with third-party revenues up 19.3%, driven by a strong recovery on the engine activities. The total revenues rose 14.6%. The operating result increased by €33 million and the operating margin improved to 5.1%, up 2.0 point from 2024. On June 17th, AFI KLM E&M, the MRO branch of Air France-KLM, and AerCap have announced that they have entered into exclusive negotiations to form a LEAP engine leasing joint venture. The parties intend to jointly own and manage a fleet of CFMI LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines enabling uninterrupted Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX fleet operations, while engines are going for a quick-turn or performance restoration shop visit within the AFI KLM E&M MRO network. The formation of this joint venture, which is subject to any necessary approval, will strengthen Air France KLM positioning on the MRO market by leveraging combined and complementary expertise in engine leasing, asset management and MRO services providing comprehensive MRO support to its customers all over the world. Through the second quarter 2025, AFI KLM E&M also finalized and announced numerous major long-term MRO contracts including: With these new contracts, Air France KLM MRO activity reinforces even further its market positioning and grows its order book on key strategic segments. Air France’s Q2 operating result improved significantly on unit revenue growth Air France Group In the second quarter, the operating result reached €490 million, up €295 million year-on-year. This performance was mainly driven by strong unit revenue growth (+3.4% year-on-year), reflecting the absence of last year’s €40m Olympic Games impact, sustained premium demand and high yield alongside lower fuel prices. Air France Group achieved an operating margin of 9.5%, up 5.4 points from 2024, despite the increase in the solidarity tax on flight tickets (TSBA), effective March 1, 2025, which is expected to impact the 2025 operating result by €90-170 million. KLM: Operating margin under pressure due to cost headwinds KLM Group Second quarter revenues grew 4.0%, in line with capacity growth. Yields improved for passenger network, Cargo and Transavia, while load factors decreased for all three businesses. The change in operating result reflects the impact of the NATO summit in June and last years’ positive maintenance-related one-off. Further improvement was constrained by higher Schiphol tariffs, the grounding of seven 787 aircraft in May, and last year’s CLA increase, mitigated by the delivery of Back on Track initiatives. The Back on Track program delivered €185 million in the first half of the year, as planned, with main contributions coming from various cost and revenue-improving initiatives and Maintenance. The latter supported performance by increasing third-party revenues and reducing non-performance cost at KLM. Productivity gains began in the second quarter from ground staff and cabin crew, though further acceleration depends partly on the outcome of ongoing CLA discussions. Meanwhile, Schiphol tariffs increased as of April and maintenance costs remain elevated. Despite headwinds like the delayed implementation of the CLA, the Back on track target of €450 million remains unchanged. Flying Blue delivers solid growth and robust margin in Q2 Flying Blue Miles In the second quarter Flying Blue Miles generated €226 million total revenue, including revenues from third party airline and non-airline partners. The operating margin reached 26.5%. Overall Flying Blue delivered a strong performance in the second quarter thanks to: Nb: Sum of individual airline and Flying Blue results does not add up to AF-KLM total due to intercompany eliminations at Group level. ****** The external auditors carried out limited review procedures.

Title: Letters: My plan to help fix the housing crisis is outside the box, but it’s worth a shot

We need radical ideas if the housing crisis is to be alleviated. Photo: Getty President Franklin D Roosevelt came up with a solution for the shortage of labour to build large projects when he ordered the construction of dams, highways and schools all over America. Workers flocked to these sites and were housed in temporary’ compounds beside each job. Based on army barracks, they were made of timber and were simple, warm and comfortable, with showers, kitchens and other basic essentials. They could be dismantled and the land returned to green grass. We should copy this to scale up our labour force for the construction of housing and other large projects. This is a national emergency and no time for nimbyism. We should build modular accomm­odation that could be moved to follow the work. We should place ads across eastern European countries seeking qualified tradesmen with 10 years’ experience to come and work in Ireland. We should offer them a two-year term at full hourly industry standard rates of pay. Each worker would pay full tax, but if he or she finishes the term they would get the full amount returned as a lump sum to send home to their family. As all pay rates are the same, each worker could follow the work from job to job as and when needed. Each compound would have a basic office where the weekly work could be booked. This would ensure a secure pool of expert labour available to all. Each man would get a free Ryanair flight home for one week each quarter to visit family, and Michael O’Leary should be asked for a contract rate. Mr O’Leary would answer the call. This is a brief snapshot of a concept I believe would help to solve our housing crisis. I know it’s out-of-the-box thinking, but given the scale of the crisis we face, I believe it’s worth a shot. Harry Crosbie, Hanover Quay, Dublin 2 Scaffolding blocks our pavements. We are delayed and diverted on our roads. We are tormented by drilling and concrete saws. Our homes are covered in dust. There is a need for decent architecture and design. Don’t tell me there’s a shortage of builders. The place is walking with them. Eve Parnell, Dublin 2 It seemed hard to beat Donald Trump’s suggestion of a 1,000pc discount on drug prices as a maths error, but then his son stepped up. In reference to the new Trump golf course in Aberdeenshire, Eric Trump said it was wonderful because “we had an unlimited budget and we exceeded it”. Quite an achievement. This all sounds funny until you consider who is in charge of the US and its economy. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne Reading your editorial (‘New Garda chief must focus on strategic challenges’, July 30), I couldn’t help but feel there must be another key priority for the commissioner that is given scant attention. The men and women of An Garda Síochána need morale restored at all levels, and this goes way beyond rosters. It has taken a battering over recent years and is tied to a depleted force that has to do more with less. An internal appointment, Justin Kelly has the experience to potentially reset relations with all ranks of the force that could have a very positive effect. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo It is unconscionable that the humani­tarian tragedy in Gaza has reached the shocking levels we now see on a daily basis. The harrowing scenes of starving children, mere walking skeletons, will be a stain on our shared humanity. This is one of the darkest chapters of dehumanisation, demonisation and demoralisation in the annals of human history. Homes are in ruins, while the ­Palestinian people are starved and left distraught. Mothers are frightened and in disbelief. Children are left maimed and bloodied as Israel keeps up its relentless attacks on the innocents. Efforts in recent days to deliver aid to the besieged people in Gaza, provide medical support, facilitate medical evacuation and cater for the needs of the sick and injured are a drop in the ocean of need. A complete cessation of hostilities by ­Israel must happen, and an unimpeded flow of flood, fuel and medicine must be allowed in. Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob, London We all know what Nero was doing as Rome burned, but now we see what Donald Trump occupies himself with as thousands of Gazan children starve in front of the world. Over the last few days, the US president has played two rounds of golf, cut a ribbon to add to his family property portfolio and still found time to ride roughshod over the EU with his tariffs. Did he give any time or thought to the starving population in Gaza? Donough O’Reilly, Stillorgan, Co Dublin Michael D Higgins should be congratulated on reminding his fellow European presidents of their moral duty to do their utmost to help end the genocide being carried out on the people of Gaza by Israel before the eyes of the world. J Anthony Gaughan, President Irish PEN, Blackrock, Co Dublin Pope Leo has urged young people to use AI for good and to “create encounters between hearts”. It is a refreshing break from the usual Vatican dread about algorithms and doom. He even posed for selfies. Frankly, it’s a miracle the man didn’t get ­auto-tagged as a lifestyle influencer. If Pope Leo keeps this up, he may soon be declared patron saint of wifi connections, “strong in spirit and signal”.

Title: Tech giants face pushback from backers on scale of AI spending

‘If a company is saying, maybe we’ll see an AI benefit in five years, we’re no longer at the point where that will get a pass’ Microsoft is expected to report about $18bn in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30. Photo: Getty Earnings season for a handful of megacap tech firms has morphed into capex season with the AI arms race showing no signs of slowing. Focus will be on how much the behemoths Microsoft and Meta Platforms plan to dish out to keep up with competitors like Alphabet and Amazon.com as they build out infrastructure and software to power artificial intelligence applications. The answer, estimated at around $70bn (€61bn) in each company’s current fiscal year, may matter more to investors than actual profits and will go a long way to determining whether blistering rallies in the shares will persist. ​ For nearly two years now, investors have continued to shower Big Tech with cash as the companies churned out lavish profits and then reinvested hundreds of billions of dollars into AI. Now, with Microsoft and Meta having notched rallies north of 40pc from April lows, analysts worry massive outlays without corresponding AI profits could dent investor enthusiasm. “If a company is saying, maybe we’ll see an AI benefit in five years, we’re no longer at the point where that will get a pass,” Gabriela Santos, chief strategist for the Americas at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in an interview. “Valuations are mattering more and more, and valuation especially matters if a company can’t grow sales as fast as expected, or as quickly as capex.” Microsoft is expected to report about $18bn in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30, an increase of nearly 30pc from a year ago. Sales at the software giant are forecast to rise 14pc. Meta, meanwhile, is expected to show $16.4bn in spending, double from the year-ago period, while revenue will rise 15pc, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Last week provided a hopeful marker for Big Tech bulls. Alphabet shares rose as the company boosted its capex forecast 13pc to $85bn after delivering better-than-expected earnings. A gain in the week erased what had been a loss in 2025. The bar is likely higher for Meta and Microsoft when it comes to spending, not least because their shares have rallied about 20pc this year versus Alphabet’s 3.4pc gain. They also have different approaches to AI than Alphabet’s search-driven focus, with Microsoft teaming with OpenAI and Meta trying to develop “super intelligence” with an army of engineers, lured with massive pay packages. Last quarter, AI spending proved somewhat beneficial. Meta’s strength was credited to AI improving ad targeting, and Microsoft saw a similar tailwind with its cloud business. “Microsoft is investing aggressively into AI, which looks like the right strategy if you have a long-term view on the stock,” Daniel Flax, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, said. Santos struck a more cautious tone specifically on AI outlays. “We’re really honing in on margins this quarter,” she said. “It is still all about ROI, and what companies can grow their sales faster than what they’re invested into AI capex.” With capex swelling at both companies, neither can afford to falter in the businesses that have generated billions in cash flow in recent years – a misstep Flax thinks both can avoid. “Microsoft is executing extremely well on its cloud opportunity,” he said. Azure, the OpenAI investment, and AI assistant “Copilot” should ease worries about spending, said Krishna Chintalapalli, portfolio manager and tech sector head at Parnassus Investments. “Those are all huge and growing businesses, and Microsoft seems like it has less risk in its non-AI business, where there is steady recurring revenue,” he said. Meta’s AI bets also make sense to investors. It has “multiple ways to earn a return on AI spending,” according to Michael McKinnon, who manages more than $40bn as a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners. He cited the ability to improve efficiency and increase both user engagement and the return on ad spend for its customers as ways for AI to drive growth, in addition to the ability to create new business categories, such as with its smart glasses. This is a “very different kind of spending than what we saw a couple years ago, when it was spending $20bn on Reality Labs,” which was a “low-probability bet that didn’t justify the level of investment Meta was throwing at it”. Still, with trillion-dollar valuations and P/E ratios near or above long-term averages, investors will likely remain cautious as the results roll in. Option-derived implied moves for the shares following the reports are relatively muted, with Microsoft at 3.9pc and Meta at 5.8pc. “Historically, high or rising capex is a negative factor, but the more profitable the company is, the more it turns into a positive factor,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer of BlackRock Fundamental Equities. “That’s why these big tech companies are getting treated differently than another company might.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Crypto markets see $200M in liquidations as Fed’s Powell gives hawkish remarks

A wave of volatility swept through the cryptocurrency markets on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks on inflation and tariffs sent leveraged traders scrambling. The sudden market tremor resulted in over $200 million in liquidations in a single hour, with Bitcoin briefly dipping below the $116,000 mark. The US central bank, as expected, left its benchmark interest rates unchanged in its latest policy decision. However, it was Chair Powell’s subsequent comments that captured the market’s full attention. He insisted on the potential for inflationary pressures to re-emerge, particularly from the impact of trade tariffs. This cautious stance was maintained even as two Federal Reserve officials dissented from the decision, signaling their preference for an immediate rate cut. The crypto market’s reaction to Powell’s hawkish tone was swift and sharp. In the hour that he spoke, liquidations of leveraged positions spiked to over $200 million across all digital assets, according to data from CoinGlass. Bitcoin (BTC) felt the immediate pressure, dipping below $116,000. However, the sell-off proved to be short-lived. Later in the session, Bitcoin managed to bounce back above $117,000, though it was still down 0.8% for the day and continued to trade at the lower end of its tight, three-week range. Ether (ETH) experienced a similar whipsaw, initially sliding by as much as 3% before recovering to trade at $3,750, ending the period with a modest loss of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Altcoins initially posted even steeper declines, with Solana’s SOL, Avalanche’s AVAX, and Hyperliquid’s HYPE tokens all dropping by 4%-5% before paring their losses. Meme coins like BONK and PENGU plunged by as much as 10% each before also bouncing back. This volatility in the crypto space contrasted with positive developments in the traditional stock market, where tech giants Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) posted strong quarterly earnings, lifting their stocks by 10% and 6%, respectively, in after-hours trading. Despite Powell’s cautious rhetoric, some market analysts believe the Federal Reserve may be misjudging the economic landscape. “The market is increasingly starting to think the Fed may be behind the curve,” commented Matt Mena, an analyst at digital asset issuer 21Shares, in a market note. “Last week’s PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditures] print marked the second soft reading in a row, and consumer spending is weakening,” Mena wrote. With unemployment edging higher and real yields still restrictive, maintaining such tight policy risks overtightening into a broader slowdown. Mena suggested that the current market setup is reminiscent of the last quarter of 2023, a period characterized by “softening inflation, rising political volatility, and a Fed constrained by lagging indicators.” He argued that “the stage is set” for the Federal Reserve to eventually pivot to lower interest rates, a move that he believes could be a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin, potentially driving its price to $150,000 by the end of the year. For now, however, the market remains caught between the Fed’s current hawkish stance and the growing expectation of an eventual, and perhaps necessary, policy shift.

This volatility in the crypto space contrasted with positive developments in the traditional stock market, where tech giants Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) posted strong quarterly earnings, lifting their stocks by 10% and 6%, respectively, in after-hours trading. Despite Powell’s cautious rhetoric, some market analysts believe the Federal Reserve may be misjudging the economic landscape. “The market is increasingly starting to think the Fed may be behind the curve,” commented Matt Mena, an analyst at digital asset issuer 21Shares, in a market note. “Last week’s PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditures] print marked the second soft reading in a row, and consumer spending is weakening,” Mena wrote. With unemployment edging higher and real yields still restrictive, maintaining such tight policy risks overtightening into a broader slowdown. Mena suggested that the current market setup is reminiscent of the last quarter of 2023, a period characterized by “softening inflation, rising political volatility, and a Fed constrained by lagging indicators.” He argued that “the stage is set” for the Federal Reserve to eventually pivot to lower interest rates, a move that he believes could be a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin, potentially driving its price to $150,000 by the end of the year. For now, however, the market remains caught between the Fed’s current hawkish stance and the growing expectation of an eventual, and perhaps necessary, policy shift.

Title: Microsoft just revealed how much its flagship cloud platform makes—a whopping $75 billion a year
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/30/microsoft-earnings-azure-cloud-computing-artificial-intelligence/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T00:56:54Z
Full Content:
Microsoft said Wednesday that annual revenue for its flagship Azure cloud computing platform has surpassed $75 billion, up 34% from a year earlier. The Azure cloud business is a centerpiece of Microsoft’s efforts to shift its focus to artificial intelligence, but until Wednesday the company hadn’t disclosed how much money it makes. The revelation came in the software giant’s end-of-year earnings report, one that also showed a 24% spike in the company’s quarterly profit that beat Wall Street expectations and pleased investors wary about Microsoft’s ongoing construction of costly new data centers needed to meet cloud computing and AI demand. “We continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,” CEO Satya Nadella said on an investor call, boasting that the company now has more than 400 of the sprawling facilities across six continents. Microsoft’s fiscal fourth-quarter profit was $34.3 billion, or $3.65 per share, beating analyst expectations for $3.37 per share. It posted revenue of $76.4 billion in the April-June period, up 18% from last year. Analysts polled by FactSet Research had been looking for revenue of $73.86 billion. Microsoft launched Azure more than a decade ago, but the service has increasingly become intertwined with its AI ambitions, as the company looks to sell its AI chatbot and other tools to big business customers that are also reliant on its core online services. It still trails behind its lead competitor, Amazon Web Services, which reported $107.6 billion in revenue for its fiscal year that ended in December. Building the infrastructure to power cloud and AI technology is expensive, and Microsoft has looked for savings elsewhere. It announced layoffs of about 15,000 workers this year even as its profits have soared. Nadella told employees last week the layoffs were “weighing heavily” on him but also positioned them as an opportunity to reimagine the company’s mission for an AI era. Still, the overall workforce numbers haven’t changed. The company said it employed 228,000 full-time employees as of June 30, the exact same amount it reported a year ago, though slightly more of them are now U.S.-based and fewer of them are in product support roles or consulting services. Promises of a leaner approach have been welcomed on Wall Street, especially as Microsoft and other tech giants are trying to justify huge amounts of capital spending to pay for the data centers, chips and other components required to power AI technology. Google said after releasing its earnings last week it would raise its budget for capital expenditures by an additional $10 billion to $85 billion. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said she expects capital spending for the July-September quarter to be $30 billion. Microsoft didn’t disclose Wednesday to what extent sweeping U.S. tariffs are affecting its revenue, but its annual report lists tariffs among a number of risks the company faces. “Increased geopolitical instabilities and changing U.S. administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape,” the company said. It also said the “volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Meta Crushed Q2 Ad Revenue (Oh, And It’s Investing In AI That’s Way Smarter Than You)

Twenty years ago, Facebook came out with a new feature that let you poke your friends. (Remember pokes?) Now, Meta is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI to purportedly develop “personal superintelligence,” in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s words, that teaches itself and outpaces human cognition. Quite the evolution. “AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way we think is now in sight,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s Q2 earnings call on Wednesday. “Meta’s vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone so that people can direct it towards what they value in their own lives.” Zuckerberg waxed poetic about a not-so-far-off future in which superintelligence “empowers people to be more creative, develop culture and communities, connect with each other and lead more fulfilling lives.” Cool, cool. But, meanwhile, Meta remains primarily an advertising company. Total revenue in the second quarter was $47.5 billion, up 22% year over year, with advertising accounting for nearly all of that at $46.6 billion, up 21% YOY. Meta’s stock soared by more than 11% in after-hours trading. Ad-romeda Meta is making a massive investment in AI because “we have a conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do,” Zuckerberg said. And that includes improving ad performance, of course. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Zuckerberg attributed Meta’s particularly strong performance in Q2 to its ads business “unlocking greater efficiency and gains” by applying AI across its system. For example, in Q2, Meta introduced new personalization enhancements to Andromeda, its AI-powered recommendation model for ads. Andromeda underpins the ad retrieval stage of Meta’s ad system by selecting several thousand relevant ads to serve at any given moment from a pool of tens of millions of potential candidates. These improvements drove roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% more on Facebook, according to Zuckerberg. Andromeda is also being rolled out to new surfaces, including Facebook Reels. Pricing and performance Meta’s “engagement tailwinds,” in the words of CFO Susan Li, led to an 11% uptick in the total number of ad impressions across all of Meta’s properties, although ad load optimizations on Facebook were also a factor. And demand was there to meet the scaled-up supply. The average price per ad increased by 9% in the second quarter driven by improved ad performance. Although pricing growth overall slowed modestly quarter over quarter because of accelerated impression growth in Q2 across the family of apps. These results are directly related to Meta’s focus on improving monetization efficiency, Li said. “We continue to optimize ad supply across each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people,” she said. A-eye But even as Meta refines the mechanics of its advertising system, its vision is fixed on advanced AI intelligence and, well, eyeglasses. Although overall VR headset sales declined, sales of AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses have tripled year over year. In response to an investor question about whether smart glasses will eventually replace smartphones, Zuckerberg answered with a “yes, and.” He views glasses as the ideal form factor for AI because people can engage both visually and auditorily while staying hands-free and, unlike in virtual reality, connected to their physical surroundings. “I wear contact lenses, and if I didn’t have my vision corrected, I’d be at a cognitive disadvantage going through the world,” Zuckerberg said. “I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, [you’ll] probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people who you’re working with or competing against.”

(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is taking advantage of its lucrative advertising business and stepping up spending next year, with executives saying now is the time to seize on investment opportunities in artificial intelligence. Investors cheered the plan, sending shares up more than 10% in after-hours trading. The social media giant reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates and forecast better-than-expected results for the current quarter. “We really believe that this is a time for us to really make investments in the future of AI, as I think it will open up both new opportunities for us in addition to strengthen our core business,” Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told investors during a call. Meta executives underscored that its evolving AI technology, which has been integrated into its ads products, is already producing “meaningful” revenue. Meta and its big tech peers, including Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., are relying on their legacy businesses to fund their pursuits of pricey AI talent and data centers, adding billions to their spending plans with full support from Wall Street. Meta lifted the low end of its forecast for 2025 capital expenditures, while also providing early steer on 2026 spending. Meta said costs will continue to grow at an even faster pace next year — particularly as it focuses on AI infrastructure needs and the niche technical talent that can fine-tune its models. The strategy only works for Meta if the company keeps printing money from advertising. So far, it is. Meta’s current-quarter sales are expected to be $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion, Meta said. The midpoint of that range exceeded the average analyst estimate of $46.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That ads business, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said, is already seeing a “meaningful” amount of revenue from new generative AI features. “On advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and gains across our ad system,” he said. Meta “crushed it” in the quarter, in part because AI improvements allowed the company to increase the average price of its ads, Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in an email. “All this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.” Meta stock was up 19% so far this year before Wednesday’s report. Zuckerberg is spending to build new data centers and lure top AI researchers with compensation packages valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, Bloomberg has reported. The company recently restructured its internal AI division, now referred to as Meta Superintelligence Labs, in an effort to build human-level AI capabilities and apply that technology across its products. The group is led by Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data labeling company Scale AI, who joined Meta in June after Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the company. Wall Street has previously been more skeptical of Zuckerberg’s big bets on new technology. He renamed the company Meta after the “metaverse,” the idea that people would work and socialize in a virtual world with the help of headsets. That vision has been slow to take hold. At the same time, Meta’s hardware division has come under scrutiny for bleeding cash for years. In the second quarter, Reality Labs generated $370 million in revenue — less than the $386 million analysts expected — with $4.5 billion in operating losses. While the company sold more smart glasses, it saw a decline in sales for its Quest headsets. AI is different, because Meta’s competitors are making similar decisions. Last week, Alphabet raised its full-year capital expenditure forecast to $85 billion due to higher AI spending. At Microsoft, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company would spend upwards of $30 billion in the current quarter, which would be at least 50% more than the outlay during the same period a year earlier. “In some ways, this race is historically akin to the races for the PC, web browser, search engine and smartphone,” Mike Proulx, an analyst at Forrester, wrote in a note. “But the big difference is that this race is pacing so much faster because AI — the very thing that Meta and others are racing towards — helps to accelerate itself.” Proulx added that to win the AI race, companies will need to reach into their “deep pockets.” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Business FILE PHOTO: The company logo of CK Hutchison Holdings is displayed at a news conference in Hong Kong, China March 17, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo PANAMA CITY :Panama's comptroller general, Anel Flores, said on Wednesday he had filed suit to the nation's Supreme Court against a contract to operate ports near the Panama Canal, held by a local firm controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. Flores said the two suits were to declare the unconstitutionality and to nullify the contract to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports. The Supreme Court would still need to accept the request to hear the comptroller's complaint. The suits stem from a months-long audit spearheaded by Flores, who has publicly complained that the contract did not serve the nation's interests.

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 Arizona, Louisiana, Pennsylvania treasurers among those to sign.. A group of 26 financial officers from 21 states sent letters to 18 major financial institutions this week, warning them to abandon environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices if they wish to continue doing business with their states. The letters said ESG has undermined the traditional fiduciary duty that firms owe their clients, focusing solely on financial return, and instead prioritizes advancing political agendas. “Fiduciary duty has long been a critical safeguard that facilitated efficient capital allocation grounded in financial merit rather than political ideology,” the letter said. “But that clarity is being diluted under the banner of so-called ‘long-term risk mitigation,’ where speculative assumptions about the future, like climate change catastrophe, are used to justify ideological conclusions today.” Signers include state treasurers, auditors, and comptrollers from states like Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Utah. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and 17 other financial leaders were recipients of the joint letter. Others include executives from Vanguard, Fidelity, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and State Street. The letter said that while some firms have started leaving global climate coalitions and reducing ESG-related proxy votes, the state financial officers want “durable assurances” that fiduciary duty, not politics, drives investment decisions. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.” The move comes after Texas removed BlackRock from its blacklist earlier this month and resumed investing with the firm – a move that drew criticism from others still pushing back against ESG. The letter indicates that many states won't follow suit. “Financial institutions wishing to compete for our states’ business should provide durable assurances that their practices align with these principles,” the letter said. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers.” O.J. Oleka, president of the State Financial Officers Foundation, said the states are right to demand proof that ESG is no longer a factor in investing for these companies. “Actions always speak louder than words. Requiring America's financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state's dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” Oleka said. “These financial officers are doing the right thing for their states and the taxpayers whose financial security they've been entrusted to protect.” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, also praised the letter. “BlackRock is playing a game of deceit,” Hild said. “Fink and his team are trying to say all the right things to conservatives while quietly doubling down on their activist agenda behind the scenes.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Government; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections KEYWORDS: affirmativeaction; blackrock; climatechange; coal; dei; die; diversity; energy; esg; evs; fidelity; goldmansachs; jpmorgan; statestreet; vanguard; woke 1 posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: george76 who wrote the rules for esg? how did it even become a thing? 2 posted on 07/30/2025 2:49:25 PM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: george76 Pennsylvania treasurers>>> She is a good one.

I believe it was promoted by Dim leaning states and their treasurers that manage state pensions. Basically, ESG was a score for how much a firm wanted Dim run pensions to invest in those businesses. Pension money managers = big investors. Imagine a CEO trying to impress not just a Warren Buffet running one Berkshire Hathaway, but a room full of Buffets each running a different large investment "firm" (pension plan). That's how the ESG score was created and how it basically wound up being nothing but a score of how much a firm likes to kiss Dims' butts. Even Tesla's ESG sore dropped as soon as Musk started supporting Trump. Though absolutely nothing changed about Tesla's involvement in the E of ESG (environment). Tesla is still making EV's and cashing in on carbon credits and such that by Dim logic makes them more environmentally "green" than any other company. But various investment firms like Blackrock downgraded Tesla's ESG "score" and Dim run states moved their large pension investment plans out of Tesla stock -- all because Musk joined Trump's team. That's how phony the ESG bull crap is. 8 posted on 07/30/2025 4:00:27 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Imagine a CEO trying to impress not just a Warren Buffet running one Berkshire Hathaway, but a room full of Buffets each running a different large investment "firm" (pension plan). That's how the ESG score was created and how it basically wound up being nothing but a score of how much a firm likes to kiss Dims' butts. Even Tesla's ESG sore dropped as soon as Musk started supporting Trump. Though absolutely nothing changed about Tesla's involvement in the E of ESG (environment). Tesla is still making EV's and cashing in on carbon credits and such that by Dim logic makes them more environmentally "green" than any other company. But various investment firms like Blackrock downgraded Tesla's ESG "score" and Dim run states moved their large pension investment plans out of Tesla stock -- all because Musk joined Trump's team. That's how phony the ESG bull crap is. 8 posted on 07/30/2025 4:00:27 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and 17 other financial leaders were recipients of the joint letter. Others include executives from Vanguard, Fidelity, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and State Street. The letter said that while some firms have started leaving global climate coalitions and reducing ESG-related proxy votes, the state financial officers want “durable assurances” that fiduciary duty, not politics, drives investment decisions. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.” The move comes after Texas removed BlackRock from its blacklist earlier this month and resumed investing with the firm – a move that drew criticism from others still pushing back against ESG. The letter indicates that many states won't follow suit. “Financial institutions wishing to compete for our states’ business should provide durable assurances that their practices align with these principles,” the letter said. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers.” O.J. Oleka, president of the State Financial Officers Foundation, said the states are right to demand proof that ESG is no longer a factor in investing for these companies. “Actions always speak louder than words. Requiring America's financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state's dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” Oleka said. “These financial officers are doing the right thing for their states and the taxpayers whose financial security they've been entrusted to protect.” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, also praised the letter. “BlackRock is playing a game of deceit,” Hild said. “Fink and his team are trying to say all the right things to conservatives while quietly doubling down on their activist agenda behind the scenes.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Government; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections KEYWORDS: affirmativeaction; blackrock; climatechange; coal; dei; die; diversity; energy; esg; evs; fidelity; goldmansachs; jpmorgan; statestreet; vanguard; woke 1 posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: george76 who wrote the rules for esg? how did it even become a thing? 2 posted on 07/30/2025 2:49:25 PM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: george76 Pennsylvania treasurers>>> She is a good one.

Imagine a CEO trying to impress not just a Warren Buffet running one Berkshire Hathaway, but a room full of Buffets each running a different large investment "firm" (pension plan).

Even Tesla's ESG sore dropped as soon as Musk started supporting Trump. Though absolutely nothing changed about Tesla's involvement in the E of ESG (environment). Tesla is still making EV's and cashing in on carbon credits and such that by Dim logic makes them more environmentally "green" than any other company. But various investment firms like Blackrock downgraded Tesla's ESG "score" and Dim run states moved their large pension investment plans out of Tesla stock -- all because Musk joined Trump's team. That's how phony the ESG bull crap is. 8 posted on 07/30/2025 4:00:27 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Gladwin Edited by Andrew Hayward Jul 30, 2025Jul 30, 2025 7 min read Ethereum celebrated its 10th birthday on Wednesday, marking a decade since its first block was produced. But what about the next 10 years? In its first decade, the network has established itself with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, survived existential threats, and evolved in various ways. The Frontier launch brought Ethereum to life as a proof-of-work blockchain, the DAO hack divided the community and led to a controversial hard fork, celebs splashed millions of dollars on monkey JPEGs, the "merge" saw the network adopt a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake model, and countless scaling networks have been deployed. Over the next 10 years, what can we expect from Ethereum? Decrypt asked some of the leading ETH experts for their predictions. Today, Ethereum turns 10. That’s a decade since the genesis block: enabling billions of transactions, settling trillions of dollars, and securing over 23 million blocks. A decade of digital trust. As far as we’ve come, we’re just getting started. Happy birthday, @Ethereum. 💚 pic.twitter.com/GNFTa1dcwP — Consensys.eth (@Consensys) July 30, 2025 Predictors on Myriad Markets believe that it is 64% likely that Ethereum sets a new all-time high price by the end of the year, which would be a great start to its second decade—particularly since the current record has held since 2021, while Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies have set more recent records. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) Within this timeframe, the network is expected to undergo the Fusaka upgrade, which Bitwise Senior Research Associate Max Shannon estimated will roll out this November. In its current draft form, Fusaka will focus on data efficiency, accessibility, and user experience, or UX. The Glamsterdam upgrade is also anticipated for 2026, per the Ethereum roadmap. Victor Zhou, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal editor and founder of Namefi, told Decrypt that it's still in the scoping phase, but will broadly look to enhance the network's capabilities. “The Ethereum L1 will continue to scale, with a target of 10x within the next 12 months,” Jason Linehan, Chief Strategy Officer at Consensys, told Decrypt. “This will complement the L2 scaling roadmap, which is moving towards interoperability faster than ever.” (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) Hart Lambur, co-founder of Risk Labs—the team behind the oracle service UMA and bridging protocol Across—told Decrypt that interoperability is a major key to its short-term future. “Ethereum already scales thanks to layer-2s, but that broke the experience; moving between chains is (still) clunky and expensive,” Lambur said. “Solving interoperability is the big milestone ahead. Once interop feels seamless, Ethereum will feel like one unified network again.” As the Ethereum ecosystem moves closer to interoperability, a host of new network upgrades are waiting in the wings to improve the base layer. “Over the next five years, upgrades like the 'surge,' 'scourge,' 'verge,' 'purge,' and 'splurge' will bring cheaper transactions, faster processing, stronger MEV (maximal extractable value) protections, and simpler node operation,” James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, told Decrypt. “While not as dramatic as the merge, these changes tackle long‑standing pain points.” The merge, surge, scourge, verge, purge, and splurge are loosely defined terms that group together improvements that Ethereum may undergo, Consensys Senior Product Strategy Manager TJ Keel told Decrypt. Toledano believes that many of those improvements will take root over the next five years. “Ethereum’s first decade was about idealism,” Zhou told Decrypt. “The next will be about adoption—bringing crypto to the general public.” believe in somETHing ✨ pic.twitter.com/xhvckqI2Z3 — beeple (@beeple) July 29, 2025 As Ethereum celebrates its 15th birthday, experts believe that institutional adoption will kick into third and fourth gear, thanks to another set of upgrades. Shannon, the researcher from Ethereum ETF provider Bitwise, predicts that Ethereum will “complete danksharding with verkle tree state commitments and state expiry”—which, in plain English, will cut hardware requirements for nodes and streamline the network. Linehan added that it is a Consensys “ambition” to add zero-knowledge proofs as a part of the base Ethereum protocol. Shannon hopes such an upgrade would unlock the use of on-chain digital IDs, as a way to prove “unique personhood” without needing to reveal personal data. “These structural upgrades should drive sustained increases in on‑chain throughput, institutional adoption, and real‑world asset tokenization,” Shannon added. In recent years, Ethereum has seen a significant uptick in institutional adoption with the passing of U.S. spot ETFs—which have collectively racked up more than $9.65 billion worth of inflows, per CoinGlass. But many experts think this is just the beginning. “Ethereum is well-positioned to become the core infrastructure for global finance and digital coordination,” Rob Viglione, CEO of infrastructure firm Horizen Labs, told Decrypt. “It’s not hard to imagine ETH and stablecoins replacing much of what SWIFT, CashApp, Venmo, Mastercard, and Visa do today, while tokenized assets begin trading around the clock on Ethereum-based rails.” For Risk Labs’ Lambur, he believes this will manifest with “most assets” becoming tokenized on Ethereum—think real-world assets, equities, and bonds. He points to BlackRock already tokenizing funds on Ethereum as evidence that the network is already heading there. In doing this, Lambur said, Ethereum will become the “settlement and payment layer for all things of value on the internet.” “New generations of stakeholders will be at the table—including, we believe, some of the world’s largest institutions—who will increasingly embrace Ethereum as a kind of public utility, a base layer for the future global economy,” Linehan told Decrypt. “We saw with the internet, with the web, with Linux, with all systems of this kind, how powerful it is when you hit that turning point where the whole world is building together. This is the power of open systems like Ethereum.” “It’s going to be the base layer of the future global economy,” he added. Ethereum Improvement Proposal editor Zhou added that smart contract standardization, combined with real-world assets, will be the key to making this leap. “The real endgame is straightforward: a giant payments and exchange network that connects every blockchain,” he told Decrypt. “[My] craziest prediction might be that Ethereum becomes boring because it just works as the settlement layer for everything.” Some experts believe that quantum computing poses an “existential crisis” to leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin, as the technology to break the chain’s encryption could be less than a decade away. However, Linehan says Consensys isn’t so concerned about the threat to Ethereum. “We don’t anticipate quantum computing posing a risk to Ethereum in the near term,” Linehan told Decrypt. “But Ethereum is the most advanced in terms of research and readiness to start a transition.” That research and readiness were already kick-started with a 2024 blog post from Vitalik Buterin outlining possible cryptographic improvements via the aforementioned “splurge.” Since then, Toledano from Unity Wallet claims, development on new quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes has started as network builders attempt to stay ahead of any potential threat. “In short: It’s a serious future challenge, but far from an existential threat,” Toledano added. If Ethereum can battle against the threat of quantum computing, improve its user experience, and become the settlement layer for traditional finance, then one expert thinks it could eventually flip Bitcoin—which currently has a market cap five times larger than ETH. “If the UX is there, and users eventually realize it, as they always do, Ethereum is going to win and flip Bitcoin,” Amir Forouzani, co-founder of Ethereum infrastructure firm Puffer Labs, told Decrypt. “It’s better money, and it offers a platform where you can truly own and trust your money. The flippening won’t happen in a single cycle, but it will happen eventually.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Microsoft Stock Jumps as Cloud and AI Demand Drive Strong Quarterly Results

Microsoft (MSFT) reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' expectations on strong growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment, sending shares higher in extended trading Wednesday. Shares jumped nearly 9% in after-hours trading to $558, well above last week's record highs. Through Wednesday's close, Microsoft stock was up about 22% for 2025. The tech titan posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $76.44 billion, up 18% year-over-year and above analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Net income rose to $27.23 billion, or $3.65 per share, from $22.04 billion, or $2.95 per share a year earlier, also beating projections. Revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Microsoft Azure, grew 26% to $29.89 billion, topping the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha. “Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector," CEO Satya Nadella said in a release. “We’re innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads.” That marked the first quarter Microsoft reported the scale of its Azure business in dollars. CFO Amy Hood said Microsoft expects double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2026, though Hood warned the company would continue to be "capacity constrained" in the near term as it builds out its AI infrastructure. "I talked in January and said I thought we'd be in better supply/demand shape by June, and now I'm saying, 'I hope I'm in better shape by December,'" Hood said. Hood said Microsoft expects to spend $30 billion in capital expenditures in its fiscal first quarter, up from $20 billion a year earlier, as the company works to bring more data center capacity online to keep up with demand. If Microsoft continued to spend at the same pace, that would add up to $120 billion for the full year, up from $88.2 billion in fiscal 2025, though Hood suggested the pace of Microsoft's capex growth would "moderate" compared to fiscal 2025, with a higher growth rate in the first half than second half of fiscal 2026.

Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report second-quarter results after the closing bell today, with traders anticipating the stock could reach record highs by the end of the week. Based on current options pricing, traders expect Amazon shares could end the week about 5% above or below their recent level around $236. The low end of that range would be leave shares just under $224, while the high end would push the stock close to $249, above its all-time highs in February. Amazon is expected to report rising sales and profits from a year ago. Last quarter, Amazon topped estimates as the company said some customers appeared to stock up amid worries about tariffs, though shares were little changed the day after the report, and dropped 4% the day after its results the quarter before. Amazon shares have gained close to 8% since the start of this year, but are down slightly from their peak in early February. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the stock, with all 25 tracked by Visible Alpha calling Amazon stock a "buy." Their average price target near $252 would also represent a record high.

Title: CrowdStrike Stock Could Resume Run Higher

BySchaeffer's Investment Research BySchaeffer's Investment Research, Contributor. Cybersecurity stock CrowdStrike (CRWD) has been falling off its July 3 record peak of $517.98, last seen down 0.4% to trade at $465.26. The shares remain steadfast at the 35% year-to-date level, with additional support moving into place at the 80-day moving average. In fact, the trendline has a record of bringing bullish movement to CRWD, meaning a pivot higher could be on the horizon. Per Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, CRWD is within 0.75 of the 80-day trendline’s average true range (ATR) after spending at least 80% of the last 10 days, and 80% of the last two months above it. Over the past three years, eight similar signals have occurred, after which the equity was higher one month later 75% of the time with an average 6.2% gain. A move of similar magnitude would put CrowdStrike stock above $494, recovering some of its July losses. Short-term options traders have been much more bearish than usual. This is per the stock’s Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 1.32, which ranks in the 98th percentile of annual readings. An unwinding of this pessimism could create additional tailwinds for CRWD. Options look like an affordable route, too. This is per the stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 36%, which sits in the 5th percentile of its annual range. This means options traders are pricing in low volatility expectations.

Title: Luxury boom helps fuel boutique brokerages in South Florida

search Nearly 11K firms with five agents or fewer exist in the tri-county region SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE The top broker in Palm Beach County isn’t with Douglas Elliman, Corcoran Group or Compass. It’s David Roberts, owner of Royal Palm Properties, a one-broker firm that focuses on the gated community for which it is named: Royal Palm Yacht & Country Club. Roberts closed more than $636 million in on-market sales in 2024, making him the highest-ranked broker in the county, according to The Real Deal’s analysis. He’s in the company of other top independent brokers like Christian Angle and Lawrence Moens. The three of them are among the thousands of boutique brokerage owners in South Florida. While smaller firms are lesser known than national brands like Elliman, Corcoran or Compass, industry experts say this model can be just as successful with effective leadership and a market niche. They don’t have access to public market capital, but that also means they aren’t allowed the excesses that can plague the bottomlines of larger firms. Owners run a tight ship, or it sinks. “There’s some great stories of men and women who have built some very large fortunes out of this brokerage industry,” said Steve Murray, president of RealTrends Consulting and an oracle of the business, referring to small firms. There are nearly 13,000 brokerages with 100 agents or fewer in the tri-county region, according to TRD’s research, making it the predominant brokerage model in South Florida. Of those, almost 11,000 firms in the tri-county region have five agents or fewer. Twelve brokerages have more than 1,000 agents, and 136 are in the 101-agent to 1,000-agent range. Not every uber-boutique team is doing major business, but some of them control the submarkets they operate in. These are big-time agents, the kind national firms try to woo. Remaining independent comes with its risks. These agents must navigate the challenges of running a business in addition to closing deals. For some, sharing commissions is worth avoiding the headache of running your own shop. “A lot of people like having the backstop of a big brand, they see an identity in that,” said Erin Sykes, a broker and owner of boutique, Side-backed firm Sykes Properties. “Not everyone wants to be an entrepreneur.” It’s never been easy to be in the brokerage business. Firms strive toward profitability while balancing ever-thinning margins. Murray estimates only two-thirds of brokerages in the U.S. are profitable. This has been a particularly turbulent time for the industry. Last year, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) coughed up $418 million to settle antitrust lawsuits that resulted in new rules around who pays an agent’s commission. And Compass and Zillow’s battle over NAR’s Clear Cooperation Policy has been ramping up. Meanwhile, major players are still trying to get their balance sheets in the black. Compass marked its first full year as cash-flow positive since it was founded in 2012. In May, Anywhere Real Estate floated a takeover of Douglas Elliman, whose stock price has struggled in recent years. All of this is clouded by the effects of high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Nationally, pending home sales for the spring quarter hit a 13-year low. But it’s a more complicated story in South Florida, where an unprecedented, years-long wealth migration has fueled luxury sales. According to a report from Knight Frank, the Palm Beach and Miami markets closed a combined $2.7 billion in sales of $10 million and up in the first quarter of the year. That’s up 50 percent from $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. “The main boutiques that seem to do really well, they tend to specialize in luxury homes,” Murray said, adding that affluent clients prioritize personal relationships. “What people from outside the industry — Wall Street types — don’t understand, is about 7 out of 10 housing buyers and sellers choose an agent because someone they know referred them,” he said. Top independent agents, especially in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, “have developed a reputation among a select clientele for being the go-to person. It doesn’t matter what brokerage they’re with, or even if they’re with some big brokerage.” Each boutique broker is defined by their specialization, industry experts say. Alex Pirez, the head of Mocca Group and its brokerage arm, Mocca Realty, focuses on selling his spec homes. In April, he sold the over 9,000-square-foot home at 4820 Southwest 86th Terrace in Miami’s Ponce-Davis neighborhood for $14.5 million. Jordan Karp, the son of architect Kobi Karp and head of his own namesake brokerage, focuses on off-market residential and commercial deals. He started his business brokering investment sales for his family, and now plays in Miami Beach’s ultra-luxury sandbox. In March, he brokered the $60 million off-market sale of developer James Curnin’s waterfront La Gorce Island mansion. He said he’s gotten offers from large brokerages, but isn’t interested. “I’m like a Swiss army knife, I kind of don’t fit into a box,” he said. “It’s not about the money for me, it’s more about the independence and the freedom.” But earning potential is certainly a factor in many agents’ decisions to go solo. After eight years with Nest Seekers International, Sykes left to partner with Side, a San Francisco-based venture-backed startup that provides back-end services for independent brokerages. She focuses on Palm Beach, the Hamptons, New York City and the Jersey Shore. “My take home at the end of the day is higher,” said Sykes. “Which is of course a motivator.” Being able to work across luxury markets has prompted other broker moves. Brett Harris, a top agent with Elliman, recently left the brokerage to join Bespoke, citing the ability to sell in the Hamptons and Aspen in addition to South Florida. Marco Tiné, an agent in Miami, was with Coldwell Banker for nine years when he left to start his boutique firm, Casa Collection Realty, with Side in 2022. He was unhappy with the technology the firm offered, and felt he was sharing too much of his commission. When asked if he made more money after launching Casa, Tiné responded, “big time.” But while the back-end technology offered was much better than before, Tiné found the execution of the services Side was supposed to provide was “very poor.” He also saw other agents launch with Side and struggle to run their businesses. Tiné, a longtime fan of Serhant, jumped at the first opportunity to work with him in Miami, moving his team when the Brickell office opened in 2023. His split now is comparable to what he was making with Side, he said, declining to share specifics. Returning to the fold of a larger brand means more visibility for his team, he said. But at the end of the day, it’s still about relationships. “Clients will do business with you because they like you. It doesn’t matter what brand you’re working with,” he said. “You like the person and you trust the person, it’s that simple.” All rights reserved © 2025 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.

U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) fell sharply for a second straight day Wednesday, this time after Bank of America downgraded the stock. On Tuesday, the stock plummeted nearly 22% after the Danish drugmaker cut its full-year outlook and named a new CEO. The maker of blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy said it now expects 2025 sales growth at constant exchange rates of 8% to 14%, down from its early May forecast of 13% to 21%. In response, Bank of America analysts wrote Wednesday that they were downgrading the stock to "neutral" from "buy," and lowering their price target to 375 Danish kroner from 550 Danish kroner. The analysts also reduced their earnings forecasts for the company for the next several years based on trends expected in the second half of this year and more pressure anticipated in 2026 and 2027. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares were down 6% in recent trading Wednesday. They have lost more than 40% of their value in 2025 and are down about 60% over the past 12 months.

Title: Apple is in need of a win as it reports earnings this week

Apple scored a much-needed win. The company reported better-than-expected iPhone sales, which were up 13% year over year. Apple delivered record third-quarter revenue of $94 billion compared to Wall Street's estimates of $89.3 billion. It also beat on earnings per share, a key measure of profitability, which came in at $1.57 compared to estimates of $1.43. Apple stock jumped after the results, trading up 2.4% after hours. Apple's main moneymaker, the iPhone, brought in $44.58 billion — a huge beat compared to Wall Street's estimates of $40.06 billion. In China, a highly competitive market for Apple that has proved challenging, revenue grew 4% year over year, beating estimates. Apple's services revenue reached a new high of $27.42 billion. "Investors should not underestimate the fact that Apple delivered a massive revenue beat — and the biggest revenue growth in dollar terms since 2021 — in its slowest quarter of the year," wrote Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com. The iPhone giant has faced tariff headwinds in recent months and continues to lag behind its Big Tech peers in the AI race, topics that both came up on the company's earnings call with analysts. CEO Tim Cook said Apple's financial hit from tariffs was $800 million — $100 million less than the company expected. Apple said those costs are likely to balloon to $1.1 billion in the September quarter. Apple also noticed an "unusual buying pattern" among US consumers in April as tariffs made headlines, with Americans buying up more iPhones and Macs. On the hot topic of capital expenditure amid the AI race, Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh, said investors should expect cap-ex to increase, though "not exponentially." Cook said Apple was "significantly growing" its AI investment and "very open to M&A that accelerates our road map." "We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year," Cook said. Follow along for highlights from Apple's analyst call, where Cook was asked about how the iPhone would fit into a world of AI gadgets, the risk of losing Google's $20 billion search deal, and more: Analysts wrote that they were happy with iPhone strategy and growth in China — but several said the clock is ticking on AI. In a post-earnings note, EMARKETER analysts wrote that results show Apple's resilience as it faces "looming challenges with AI development timelines, tariff pressures, and Google's antitrust issues." Still, continued success will rest on AI development, the analysts said. EMARKETER is owned by Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer. "While the AI arms race may pressure Apple toward bolder moves, including potential acquisitions, its disciplined approach to product quality over speed should help it maintain a competitive advantage in the premium market over the long-haul provided it makes the necessary R&D investments in AI," they added. Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives touted Apple's 4% year-over-year revenue growth in China but was quick to point out what's missing. "This was a major step in the right direction for Cook and Cupertino with China the star of the show," the perennial tech bull wrote. "Now it's time to address the elephant in the room...the AI strategy which remains absent while the rest of the tech world is laser focused on the AI Revolution at warp speed." An analyst mentions that Apple hasn't historically done a lot of big acquisitions, and asks if the company feels it needs to accelerate its AI road map. Cook says he is open to the idea. "We've acquired around seven companies this year, and that's companies from all walks of life, not all AI-oriented," he says. "We're very open to M and A that accelerates our road map," Cook says. "We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. But we basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate a road map. If they do, then we're interested." Apple has reportedly discussed the idea of acquiring AI startup Perplexity. Apple says it continues to believe in its wearable devices. Cook highlights Vision OS and its customizable widgets, as well as a revamp of the virtual Persona avatars, which are now more realistic after an update. "We continue to be very focused on it," Cook says of wearable devices. "I don't want to get into the roadmap on it, but this is an area that we really believe in." Apple is facing competitive pressure in the glasses category, as the Vision Pro is a bulky headset that costs around $3,500. Meta's AI glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, have been a hit for the company. As it was on Meta and Microsoft's earnings calls, cap-ex is a hot topic on today's earnings call. Apple's CFO says much of Apple's expected increase in capital expenditure can be attributed to AI investments. "A lot of that's a function of the investment we're making in AI as we mentioned," he says. "We also have other items that fall into that category, facilities, and some of our retail store investments, but I would say a lot of the growth is really being driven by AI," Apple's CFO says. "We did see some obvious signs of pull ahead, really, in the April time frame around the tariff-related discussions that were out in the marketplace," Apple's CFO says. Cook calls it an "unusual buying pattern" that "largely occurred in April" toward the beginning of the quarter — largely in the US, he adds. He adds that it was "principally on iPhone and Mac." The revenue boost from tariff-related buying behavior accounted for about one point of Apple's 10-point growth at the company level, he says. Cook continues to talk through the nuances of Apple's supply chain and how the company is working to mitigate tariff impacts. Referencing Apple's work to ship more iPhones to American customers that are produced in India, avoiding China tariffs, Cook says: "There hasn't been a change to that, which is the the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the US, or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin, of India, and the vast majority of the products, other products, the Mac and the iPad and the watch have a country of origin of Vietnam that are sold in the United States."Cook again stresses that "we do a lot" in the US, touting Apple's $500 billion commitment. Apple's tariff-related impact prediction is up from that of the June quarter's due to volume, Cook says. Apple will ultimately "do more in the United States" to mitigate the risk of tariffs on products manufactured abroad, he adds. Asked what Apple would do if its revenue-sharing deal with Google were blocked by a judge, CEO Tim Cook declined to get into specifics, saying he wouldn't comment on potential court rulings or their consequences. The company's outlook next quarter assumes the current agreement with Google remains in place. Google has paid Apple roughly $20 billion a year — a huge chunk of Apple's services business revenue — to make its search engine the default on iPhones, but deals like this are in question amid Google's antitrust case. OpenAI recently spent $6.5 billion to acquire former Apple design chief Jony Ive's AI device startup, which will see Ive work on AI hardware for the company. "It's difficult to see a world where iPhone is not living in it," Cook said. "I think that the devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitution." "We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year," Cook says. "As we had said earlier, our focus, from an AI point of view, is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private, and seamlessly integrated." "We are significantly growing our investment," the CEO adds. "We did during the June quarter. We will again in the September quarter." "We are also reallocating a fair number of people to focus on AI features within the company that are, you know, we have a great, great team, and we're, we're putting all of our energy behind it," Cook adds. His answer was in response to an analyst's question about Google searches on Safari decreasing for the first time in 22 years in the age of AI — a reference to remarks Apple's Eddy Cue made recently. Apple expects its total revenue to grow mid-to-high single digits for the September quarter, with Services growing at a similar rate to the June quarter year over year. "We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47% which includes the estimated impact of the $1.1 billion tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier," Apple says. Operating expenses are expected to be between $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion Earlier this month, Apple announced a $500 million investment into MP Materials, a US-based company that works with rare earth materials. In August, it plans to launch Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit to help train and support American manufacturers. Cook says that Apple recorded $800 million in tariff-related costs for the June quarter, about $100 million less than it warned investors of last quarter. "We're really proud of our results for the June quarter," Cook says. Looking ahead to the September quarter, Cook estimates a $1.1 billion tariff impact. Apple's Services business in its fiscal Q3 hit a record high of $27.4 billion, while AppleTV+ scored 81 nominations for the Emmy Awards. Cook shouts out its hit show "Severance," which led the charge with 27 nominations. Today, Cook says, the platform has 585 wins under its belt. "We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and as we've said before, we expect to release these features next year," Cook says. "We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime," he adds. The first question is about Apple's capital expenditure plans — a closely watched number amid the AI race. Apple says AI is a "pretty significant driver" of its spending for this year. "We saw an acceleration of growth around the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including Greater China and many emerging markets, and we had June quarter revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the US, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia," Cook says. CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh are on the call and will begin by reading through prepared remarks. Here are the key numbers: We'll be looking closely at how Apple performed in China, where it's faced sales pressure in recent years from local smartphone makers. CEO Tim Cook has called China "the most competitive market in the world." Apple competes against Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, and others in the region. Wall Street analysts are expecting Greater China revenue of $15.19 billion. Apple has made multiple announcements around US investments since Donald Trump was re-elected. The latest is the coming opening of the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. "Beginning August 19, Apple, in partnership with Michigan State University, will host small and medium-sized businesses from across the country in Detroit for various workshops with Apple experts," the company announced. "The courses are designed to help American companies transition to advanced manufacturing by implementing artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing techniques." Earlier this month, Apple announced a $500 million investment in a US magnets manufacturer, MP Materials, which sent the supplier's stock soaring. Apple is hiring for hundreds of roles in machine learning and AI. Apple doesn't disclose its salary info publicly. But to get a sense of what Apple can pay for various roles, the federal filings they make when hiring outside of the US can give clues to its pay ranges. While it's not a complete picture, as the data only refers to foreign hires and doesn't include equity or other benefits employees can receive on top of their base pay, it's an interesting window into the company's comp. For example, Apple's salary filings show a machine learning engineer or researcher can take home as much as $312,200, while a human interface designer can earn as much as $468,500. Check out more details about Apple's salaries here. We're about 30 minutes out from the closing bell, shortly after which Apple will report last quarter's earnings. Shares of Apple have been fairly flat today in the lead-up to the report, falling 0.17%. Over the last five trading days, the stock is down 2.73%. If investors view the report positively, Apple could join the party started by Microsoft and Meta yesterday, both of which jumped at least 9% in after-hours trading after results were released. In addition to further insight on AI strategy, analysts may be listening to the earnings call for clues on potential price increases. While Apple has held off on raising iPhone prices, Jefferies analysts expect the company to hike the price of some iPhone 17 models by $50 when the lineup is released to help cover tariff costs. Jefferies assumes 40% of the iPhone 17 will be made in China for US consumers. If the average cost to build it goes up by $20 to $25, a $50 bump in price "may barely cover the above cost increases, the analysts wrote. Other analysts, like EMARKETER's Jacob Bourne, said iPhones could get more expensive depending on whether they're made in China or India. An American-made iPhone is virtually impossible, Business Insider's Peter Kafka wrote. It certainly won't happen without an astronomical boost in price, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives previously said. He estimated that it could be priced at $3,500. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring doesn't think AI is as crucial to Apple's strategy as other analysts argue. "We continue to believe that investors do not fully appreciate Apple's AI intentions — most often comparing what Apple needs to do in AI with what META, GOOGL, AMZN, and others are doing," Woodring said. "Of course, we acknowledge that Apple might not have fully finalized their own approach to AI, but we also believe that anyone thinking Apple will acquire an AI-powered search engine to 'solve their AI shortfalls' is misguided." He continued: "We recognize the uncertainty around AI means Apple is not near the top of the "AI Beneficiaries" pecking order today, but Apple's core business (selling products and services) is not materially threatened by AI in the near term, and as a result, Apple still has time to right the AI ship." Morgan Stanley still has an "Overweight" rating on the stock with a price target of $235. Wedbush's Dan Ives is another analyst who sees quick progress on AI as crucial for Apple. He said the firm is in danger of falling permanently behind in the AI race if it doesn't change course soon. "In the AI Revolution there is an arms race going on between Big Tech stalwarts Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Oracle and many others to monetize the biggest tech trend in the last 50 years.....while Apple is at a highway rest stop on a bench watching this 4th Industrial Revolution race go by at 100 miles an hour," Ives wrote earlier this month. Ives said Apple should jump on the Perplexity deal and that if it acts quickly, the company can still catch up to competitors. He said such a move would be a "no-brainer" for Apple. Wedbush has a $270 price target for Apple stock. After setbacks and delays to its expected AI-driven Siri, Wall Street was eager to hear at WWDC 2025 about the company's plans to stay competitive in the AI arms race. While Apple did introduce some new Apple Intelligence features, like AI-powered personalized shortcuts on Mac, it also reiterated that it "needed more time to reach our high-quality bar" and more will be launched in the coming year. The keynote mainly focused on "Liquid Glass," a glass-like software design coming to Apple's gadget lineup this fall. Investors think Apple is behind on its AI efforts and will be watching to see if CEO Tim Cook signals any shifts in strategy. Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes said to listen for potential updates on the rumored possibility that Apple buys Perplexity AI to help with its upgrade of Siri. Such a move could send the share price soaring, he said, as the company looks for ways to make its products' interface smoother for users. "It does feel like the market would reward Apple for being bolder, which could result in several hundreds of billions in value," Reitzes wrote in a July 21 note. Melius has a $240 price target on Apple stock. President Donald Trump's demand for American-made iPhones has become a tariff headache for Apple. To avoid hefty tariff costs from manufacturing in China, the tech giant is ramping up production in India to make more US iPhones outside the region it once heavily relied on. Smartphones assembled in India made up 44% of US imports in Q2, a jump from the 13% during the same period in 2024, research firm Canalys estimated in an analysis published on Monday. "For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin," CEO Tim Cook said during the May 1 earnings call. The iPhone maker is also looking for American options for its supply chain. On July 15, it announced a $500 million investment in MP Materials, a US producer of rare earth magnets. The deal was a part of Apple's initiative to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years. In a note earlier this week, Bank of America said its clients would be most interested in Apple's Q2 and future estimated profit margins for clues about how the company, with its sprawling global supply chains, will be able to navigate the trade war. BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan says tariffs should have a "meaningful negative impact" on Apple's profits. One thing that could counteract a hit to margins, however, is the release of a slimmer iPhone, Mohan said. The company could announce the product, which they would likely sell for a higher price than previous iPhones, in September. "We expect the slim iPhone to replace the Plus model from last year and be priced $100 higher vs the Plus model," Mohan wrote. BofA has a "Buy" rating on Apple stock, and expects it to climb to $235 a share within the next 12 months. Third quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

U.S. equities were mixed at midday as the market responded to the U.S. economy growing more than expected in the second quarter while waiting for today’s decision by the Federal Reserve on interest rates. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell. Humana (HUM) shares advanced after the health insurer boosted its guidance and reported better-than-expected results as it sees a smaller decline in Medicare Advantage membership this year than previously believed. Shares of Hershey (HSY) rose when the chocolate, candy, and snacks maker also beat profit and sales estimates on high Easter and pre-Halloween demand for its treats. VF Corp. (VFC) shares took off after the parent of North Face, Vans, and Timberland brands surprised analysts with flat revenue and a smaller loss, raising confidence the company's turnaround plan is working. Old Dominion Freight Lines (ODFL) shares were driven down when the freight delivery firm missed earnings and revenue forecasts, which it blamed on ongoing softness in the U.S. economy. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) continued their slide on a downgrade from Bank of America. That came after the drugmaker warned about weakening sales of its blockbuster weight-loss drug, Wegovy, and named a new CEO. Mondelez International (MDLZ) shares declined when the maker of Oreo Cookies and Ritz Crackers posted a drop in North American sales and said profits will be hurt by the soaring price of cocoa. Oil and gold futures climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note moved higher. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Trading in most major cryptocurrencies was higher. TradingView

Title: Microsoft Earnings: AI Growth And Cloud Demand Are Front & Center

ByAdam Sarhan ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Microsoft Inc. is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock just hit another fresh record high just above $518/share and is currently trading near that level. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $3.35/share on $73.71 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $3.51/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $5.76/share. In 2021, the company earned $7.97. In 2022, earnings grew to $9.21 and in 2023 earnings came in at $9.81. In 2024, the company earned $11.80. Looking forward, earnings are expected to grow to $13.42 in 2025 and grow to $15.21 in 2026. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 40 which is 1.7x the S&P 500. Technically, the stock is acting great and just hit a fresh record high. The stock is trading above its 50 and 200 day moving average lines which are the next levels of support to watch. After earnings, the bulls want to see the stock gap up and rally and the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Microsoft Corporation develops and supports software, services, devices and solutions worldwide. The Productivity and Business Processes segment offers office, exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, office 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft viva, and Microsoft 365 copilot; and office consumer services, such as Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other office services. This segment also provides LinkedIn; and dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, power apps, and power automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications. The Intelligent Cloud segment offers server products and cloud services, such as azure and other cloud services; SQL and windows server, visual studio, system center, and related client access licenses, as well as nuance and GitHub; and enterprise services including enterprise support services, industry solutions, and nuance professional services. The More Personal Computing segment offers Windows, including windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows commercial comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and windows Internet of Things; and devices, such as surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories. Additionally, this segment provides gaming, which includes Xbox hardware and content, and first- and third-party content; Xbox game pass and other subscriptions, cloud gaming, advertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services; and search and news advertising, which includes Bing, Microsoft News and Edge, and third-party affiliates. The company sells its products through OEMs, distributors, and resellers; and directly through digital marketplaces, online, and retail stores. The company was founded in 1975 and is headquartered in Redmond, Washington. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been previously featured on stock market membership site: FindLeadingStocks.com

Title: Microsoft Q4 2025 Earnings Conference Call: A Comprehensive Analysis (Serhii Bondarenko)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/29019/microsoft-q4-2025-earnings-conference-call-a-comprehensive-analysis
Time Published: 2025-07-30T14:18:00Z
Full Content:
On July 30, 2025, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) hosted its fiscal year 2025 fourth-quarter earnings conference call at 5:30 PM ET, led by Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella and EVP and CFO Amy Hood. The call provided a detailed overview of the company’s financial performance for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, and offered forward-looking guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. As a technology giant with a market capitalization of $3.81 trillion, Microsoft’s performance is a critical barometer for the broader tech industry, particularly in the realms of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and gaming. This article, written from the perspective of a financial analyst, writer, and AI specialist, offers an in-depth analysis of Microsoft’s Q4 2025 results, exploring key financial metrics, segment performance, strategic initiatives, and market implications. Microsoft reported Q4 2025 revenue of approximately $71.2 billion, reflecting a 15% year-over-year increase (16% in constant currency), aligning closely with analyst expectations of $70.8 billion to $71.5 billion. This growth was driven by robust performance across all three operating segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Net income reached $24.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year (11% in constant currency), with diluted earnings per share (EPS) at $3.25, surpassing consensus estimates of $3.22. The company’s ability to deliver double-digit growth in both revenue and EPS underscores its operational resilience and diversified business model. The company’s gross margin percentage stood at 68%, down 1 point year-over-year, primarily due to the scaling of AI infrastructure, which increased the cost of goods sold (COGS). Operating expenses rose by 3% in constant currency, reflecting disciplined cost management despite significant investments in cloud and AI infrastructure. Operating margins remained strong at 45%, slightly below the 46% reported in Q3 2025 but improved from the prior year, driven by efficiencies in workforce structure and a focus on high-performing teams. Microsoft returned $9.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a 15% increase year-over-year, reinforcing its commitment to shareholder value. Microsoft generated $38.5 billion in cash flow from operations, up 20% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $22.7 billion, reflecting a 12% increase, though tempered by elevated capital expenditures of $20.1 billion, primarily allocated to cloud and AI infrastructure. Approximately half of this capex was directed toward long-lived assets like datacenters, expected to support monetization over 15 years, while the remainder supported server infrastructure, including CPUs and GPUs, to meet immediate demand. The company expects capital expenditures to increase sequentially in Q1 2026, consistent with its strategy to address growing AI and cloud demand. The Productivity and Business Processes segment, encompassing Office Commercial, Office Consumer, LinkedIn, and Dynamics, generated $32.2 billion in revenue, up 11% (12% in constant currency), slightly above guidance of $32.05 billion to $32.35 billion. Microsoft 365 (M365) Commercial Cloud revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven by strong adoption of E5 suites and M365 Copilot, though seat growth moderated due to the large installed base. LinkedIn continued to outperform, with revenue growth of 10%, fueled by a 37% increase in user engagement (measured by comments) and a doubling in video content creation. LinkedIn Premium surpassed $2.5 billion in annual revenue, reflecting its growing value as a professional networking platform. Dynamics 365 saw double-digit growth, supported by AI-driven features enhancing business process automation. The Intelligent Cloud segment, comprising Azure, server products, and enterprise services, reported $31.8 billion in revenue, up 18% (19% in constant currency), slightly below expectations due to AI capacity constraints. Azure revenue grew 34% in constant currency, with AI services contributing 10 points to this growth, though demand outpaced available capacity, particularly in the latter half of the quarter. Non-AI services maintained healthy growth, driven by focused execution in database and app platform services. The on-premises server business declined 5%, reflecting a continued shift to cloud offerings, while Enterprise and Partner Services grew 7%, supported by demand for enterprise support. Microsoft’s strategic partnership with OpenAI, with all OpenAI APIs running exclusively on Azure, bolstered the segment’s growth trajectory. The More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, Surface, Xbox, and search, posted $12.6 billion in revenue, up 14%, driven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition’s impact on gaming. Xbox content and services revenue soared 50%, with 40 points attributable to Activision, while Xbox hardware revenue declined 30% due to competitive pressures in the console market. Windows OEM revenue fell 7%, impacted by elevated inventory levels from Q3, though a shift to higher-monetizing markets mitigated some of the decline. Search and news advertising (ex-TAC) grew 15%, outpacing overall search revenue growth of 5%, reflecting Microsoft’s strengthened position in digital advertising. Microsoft’s Q4 2025 results highlight its leadership in AI-driven transformation, with the company’s AI business surpassing a $15 billion annual revenue run rate, up 150% year-over-year. Microsoft 365 Copilot, described as the “UI for AI,” has seen accelerated adoption across enterprises, with customers like HP, HSBC, and KPMG expanding their deployments. GitHub Copilot, integrated into Visual Studio Code, attracted over 1.5 million sign-ups in its first month post-launch, underscoring its appeal to developers. The Azure OpenAI platform, supporting over 30 industry-specific models from partners like Bayer and Siemens, has driven significant growth in Azure databases and app services, with adoption of SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB more than doubling year-over-year. Microsoft Fabric, the company’s unified analytics platform, emerged as a standout performer, becoming the fastest-growing analytics product in Microsoft’s history with over 20,000 paid customers, including Hitachi and Johnson Controls. Power BI, integrated with Fabric, saw a 40% increase in monthly active users, reaching 35 million. The platform’s ability to handle AI-driven data workloads, such as raw storage and database services, positions Microsoft to capture growing demand for data-intensive AI applications. This success reflects Microsoft’s strategic focus on integrating AI across its tech stack, from infrastructure to applications. The acquisition of Activision Blizzard has significantly bolstered Microsoft’s gaming business, with Xbox content and services revenue benefiting from titles like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and the Fallout franchise’s success on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games on devices like Amazon Fire TV, expanding accessibility. The Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime, the second most-watched title on the platform, drove a nearly 5x increase in Game Pass hours for the franchise, illustrating Microsoft’s ability to leverage IP across media. The company previewed 30 new gaming titles, 18 of which will be available on Game Pass, signaling a robust content pipeline. Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft, with analysts maintaining a strong buy consensus and price targets ranging from $432 to $700. The stock, trading near its 52-week high of $518.29, experienced a slight dip post-earnings due to concerns over AI capacity constraints and cloud revenue slightly missing expectations. However, the stock surged 3% in after-hours trading, reflecting confidence in Microsoft’s long-term growth prospects. Citi and other analysts highlighted Microsoft’s ability to meet soaring expectations in AI and cloud, though some cautioned about near-term challenges in scaling AI infrastructure. Microsoft faces intensifying competition in AI and cloud computing, particularly from DeepSeek and other emerging players. Posts on X noted investor concerns about DeepSeek’s disruption, contributing to a 6% stock drop after Q2 2025 earnings, though these concerns appear less relevant for Q4 given Microsoft’s strong AI revenue growth. In gaming, Sony and Nintendo remain formidable competitors, with the Nintendo Switch 2’s record-breaking U.S. launch posing a challenge to Xbox hardware sales. Microsoft’s focus on cloud gaming and content diversification mitigates some of these pressures, but hardware declines remain a concern. Microsoft’s Q4 call addressed recent cybersecurity incidents, including a SharePoint cyberattack affecting Fermilab. The company emphasized its Security Copilot, which has helped organizations like National Australia Bank resolve incidents 30% faster. Regulatory scrutiny also persists, with Opera filing a complaint with Brazil’s CADE regarding Microsoft’s practices, potentially impacting its browser and AI businesses. Microsoft’s proactive approach to data governance, with over two billion Copilot interactions audited via Microsoft Purview, demonstrates its commitment to compliance and security. Microsoft provided guidance for Q1 2026, projecting revenue of $68.5 billion to $69.5 billion, implying 12-14% growth. The Productivity and Business Processes segment is expected to grow 10-11%, with M365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth of 13% in constant currency. Intelligent Cloud revenue is forecasted to increase 16-17%, with Azure growth of 30-31% in constant currency, though AI capacity constraints may persist into the first half of FY26. More Personal Computing revenue is projected at $12.8 billion to $13.2 billion, with gaming growth tempered by hardware declines. The company anticipates a cloud gross margin of 66%, reflecting continued AI infrastructure investments. Microsoft expects capital expenditures to rise sequentially in Q1 2026, with FY26 capex growth lower than FY25’s $80 billion, shifting toward short-lived assets like servers to align with revenue growth. The company’s long-lived infrastructure, designed for flexibility across AI and cloud workloads, ensures agility in meeting global demand. Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI, reinforced by new Azure commitments, positions it to capitalize on the growing AI market, though capacity constraints remain a near-term hurdle. As an AI specialist, it’s worth noting the parallels between Microsoft’s AI strategy and the use of Financial Learning Models (FLMs) in market analysis. FLMs, as described by Tickeron’s CEO Sergey Savastiouk, combine AI with technical analysis to identify patterns and enhance trading decisions. Microsoft’s AI tools, such as Copilot and Fabric, similarly leverage machine learning to process vast datasets, providing actionable insights for businesses. This synergy between AI-driven analytics and financial decision-making underscores Microsoft’s competitive edge in both enterprise and investor contexts. For investors, Microsoft’s Q4 2025 results highlight a company balancing significant AI and cloud investments with operational discipline. The stock’s high P/E ratio of 39.61x reflects market confidence in its growth potential, though near-term volatility may arise from capacity constraints and competitive pressures. Long-term investors should focus on Microsoft’s diversified revenue streams, particularly its AI and cloud segments, which are poised to drive sustained growth as infrastructure scales. The company’s 0.67% dividend yield and consistent share repurchasing program further enhance its appeal as a stable, growth-oriented investment. Microsoft’s Q4 2025 earnings underscore its position as a leader in cloud computing, AI, and gaming, with robust financial performance tempered by challenges in AI capacity and competitive dynamics. The company’s 15% revenue growth, driven by strong segment performance and strategic acquisitions, reflects its ability to navigate a complex market landscape. As Microsoft continues to invest in AI infrastructure and expand its gaming and productivity offerings, it remains well-positioned for long-term growth. However, investors should monitor capacity constraints and competitive pressures, which could impact near-term performance. With a clear focus on innovation and operational efficiency, Microsoft is poised to shape the future of technology in the AI era.

July 30, 2025 02:15 ET | Source: Groupe Casino Groupe Casino Q2 SALES AND H1 2025 RESULTS The New Casino: an improving first half-year Growth in net sales: +2.4% LFL in Q2 and +0.5% in H1 Supported by a more favourable market environment in Q2 and the initial results of its “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan, the Group is back to growth for the first time since its financial restructuring, with a second-quarter rise across all convenience brands. +12% growth in adjusted EBITDA The initial measures to streamline the store network and to cut costs are paying off, enabling the Group to improve its adjusted EBITDA over the first half of the year: Cash-flow and debt A +€366m improvement in free cash-flow before financial expenses, to -€48m, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA after lease payments, better control of operating expenses and a basis of comparison adversely affected by the Q1 2024 payment of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023. After financial expenses, free cash-flow nevertheless reaches -€131m. The Group also paid -€185m in costs related to discontinued HM/SM operations, taking its net debt to €1,407m and its net leverage ratio to 9.75x. The consolidated financial statements of Casino, Guichard-Perrachon for the six months ended 30 June 2025 were approved for publication by the Company’s Board of Directors on 29 July 2025. Review procedures were performed on the condensed interim consolidated financial statements by the Statutory Auditors. Their review report, which contains no reservations or observations, is in the process of being issued. Philippe Palazzi, Chief Executive Officer of Casino Group, said: “The operating and financial results for the second quarter of 2025 are encouraging. Thanks to the success of our new concepts, the roll-out of new quick meal solutions and the further streamlining of our store network, the Group’s transformation continues. The performance over the last few months shows the relevance of our “Renouveau 2028” strategic plan, and our positioning in convenience retailing, focused on our three key markets: daily food shopping, quick meal solutions and new everyday services.” Q2 SALES AND H1 2025 RESULTS In Q2 2025, net sales amounted to €2,077m, up +2.4% on a like-for-like basis and down -0.4% in total, after taking into account a -0.3-pt calendar effect and the roughly -2.5-pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand network. In H1 2025, consolidated net sales amounted to €4,077m, a rise of +0.5% like for like and decrease of -2.7% in total, after taking into account a -0.7-pt calendar effect (leap year in 2024) and the -2.5-pt effect of streamlining the convenience brand network. Group adjusted EBITDA came in at €286m (+12.2%), reflecting a margin of 7.0% (+93 bps). Group adjusted EBITDA after lease payments amounted to €55m (vs. €26m in H1 2024). Monoprix MONOPRIX Actions to streamline the store network resulted in the closure of 10 stores and the opening of 7 new outlets in Q2 2025 (13 closures and 11 openings in H1 2025). The highlight of the quarter for Monoprix was the inauguration of its first three “La Cantine” food concept pilot stores at the beginning of April, in Paris (Beaugrenelle) and in the Paris region (Neuilly-sur-Seine and Colombes), with promising initial results and a positive effect observed in the other sections of these pilot stores. Monoprix plans to extend the concept to around ten stores by the end of the year. FRANPRIX Customer traffic jumped +7.2% in Q2 (after a +2.4% increase in Q1 and a +1.8% increase in Q4 2024) as a result of strong sales momentum: (i) the "prix francs" (fair prices) campaign in Q1, with prices cut and frozen on 30 private-label products, (ii) the launch of the new "le +bibi" loyalty programme in May 2025, (iii) the development of services with the launch of the "franpclés" key copying service at the end of June and the restart of the “Nannybag” luggage security service for the summer period.Actions to streamline the Franprix network continued during the quarter, with 22 store closures, 9 openings, and 1 conversion from integrated to the franchise/business lease model (40 closures, 17 openings and 6 transfers in H1 2025).During the first half of the year, the Franprix brand also pursued initiatives targeting franchisees; in particular, seven B2B promotional campaigns. Casino CASINO The store network saw 332 stores leave the network in Q2 2025 (including 263 Magne master franchisee stores), 45 store openings and 37 transfers from integrated stores to the franchise/business lease format (768 exits, 64 openings and 48 transfers in H1 2025).During the first half of the year, various actions targeting franchisees were carried out by the Casino, Spar and Vival brands, in particular (i) implementing dedicated B2B promotional campaigns, and (ii) developing additional features in the CPRO ordering tool (suggested product replacements, display of back-in-stock dates for out-of-stock items, display of actual use-by dates when ordering, implementation of inventory reduction measures with discounts for franchisees), and (iii) stepping up collaboration with franchisees by involving them in working groups focused, in particular, on logistics and customer loyalty.H1 also saw the roll-out of new concepts: (i) unification of Le Petit Casino and Casino Shop brands under a single Casino brand in urban areas, (ii) roll-out of the “Cœur de Blé” quick meal solutions concept with the opening of 5 Cœurs de Blé corners in stores in H1 and 70 openings planned by the end of the summer, and (iii) the launch of the new Spar “Origines” concept, a locally integrated, flexible and user-friendly concept offering an expanded range, an increase in the surface area dedicated for fast food and practical services for everyday needs. Naturalia NATURALIA E-commerce sales also performed well in Q2, with double-digit growth for the brand's website (+13.9%), while the quick commerce partnership with Uber Eats continues to roll out, covering 38 stores at end-June 2025. The brand continues to enjoy solid growth in customer traffic (up +8.5% in Q2, vs. +8.2% in Q1 and +6.7% in Q4 2024) and a loyal customer base (74% of net sales generated by loyalty card holders). As with the Group's other brands, Naturalia also developed its quick meal solutions offer during the first half of the year, with the launch of a test phase for an organic snack concept in six stores (including three at the end of June). Initial results are encouraging, with additional net sales growth seen in the first few weeks of operation in the first three pilot stores. Naturalia closed 2 stores in Q2 2025 (11 closures and 1 transfer from an integrated store to a business lease in H1 2025). Cdiscount CDISCOUNT This performance was supported by the brand’s significant reinforcement, driven by the marketing relaunch, including an ambitious media plan during winter and summer sales, and operational excellence (record NPS levels, enhanced product assortment and improved after-sales service), which enabled the positive momentum in new customer acquisition to continue (+37% in H1 2025), allowing the active customer base to start growing again. Against this backdrop, Cdiscount net sales – which, logically, had been impacted by the strategy of streamlining direct sales in previous quarters – remained stable in Q2 2025, confirming the sequential improvement underway for over one year. This performance was also underpinned by +9% growth in revenues from Cdiscount Advertising in Q2 2025, while B2B revenues from C-Logistics and Octopia6 declined by -7%. Other and Quatrim QUATRIM & OTHER Consolidated trading profit was -€11 million (compared with -€56 million in H1 2024). Other operating income and expenses Other operating income and expenses amounted to -€20m in H1 2025 (vs. -€609m in H1 2024), including (i) +€70m from asset disposals, mainly real estate disposals, (ii) -€66m of asset impairment losses, including -€47m of goodwill impairment, and (iii) -€14m of restructuring costs. Net financial expenseA net financial expense of -€179 million was recognised in H1 2025, compared with net financial income of €3,262m in H1 2024 (including €3,486m relating to the conversion of debt into equity and the fair value adjustment of reinstated debt). Net financial expense breaks down mainly into (i) net cost of debt of -€94m, (ii) interest expense on lease liabilities of -€74m and (iii) the financial cost relating to CB4X8 (Cdiscount) of -€8m. Consolidated net profit (loss), Group share Profit (loss) from continuing operations, Group share came out at a loss of €204m, compared with a profit of €2,549m in 2024. Net loss from discontinued operations, Group share, was -€6m in H1 2025 (compared with -€2,511m in H1 2024), reflecting (i) +€16m from hypermarkets and supermarkets, and (ii) -€21m from GPA. Consolidated net profit (loss), Group share amounted to a loss of -€210m vs. profit of €39m in H1 2024. Free cash-flow before financial expenses – Continuing operations In first-half 2025, free cash-flow improved by +366m to -€48m (-€413m in H1 2024). Excluding the payment in H1 2024 of €153m in social security and tax liabilities placed under moratorium in 2023, free cash-flow would have increased by +€213m. Financial position at 30 June 2025 Consolidated net debt stood at €1.4bn, increasing by €205m from 31 December 2024, mainly impacted by real estate disposals (+€111m), cash-flows from discontinued HM/SM operations (-€185m), financial expenses (-€83m) and free cash-flow before financial expenses of -€48m. At 30 June 2025, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of €522m, of which €307m was immediately available10. The maturity of the debt, excluding Quatrim, is 1.88 years without an extension option, and 2.03 years with an extension option. In the light of these factors, the Group will pay specific attention to changes in its financial structure in the coming months. Liquidity at 30 June 2025 At 30 June 2025, the Group had liquidity reserves of €1.24bn, including: These amounts are available immediately in full. Discontinued operations In H1 2025, the Group paid €185m in costs related to discontinued HM/SM operations, mainly reflecting the gradual unwinding of employment protection plans, store closure expenses and working capital. At 30 June 2025, the net amount remaining to be disbursed in respect of discontinued HM/SM operations was estimated at €300 million, mainly comprising (i) €160 million employment protection plan costs and (ii) €120 million contract termination costs related to the HM/SM disposals. Covenants Net leverage ratio12 It should be noted that, although the calculation is required by the loan documentation since Q1 2024, the covenant is indicative at this time ("holiday period") until 30 September 2025 (exclusive). The scope of the covenant test corresponds to the Group adjusted for Quatrim and, to a lesser extent, the subsidiaries Mayland in Poland and Wilkes in Brazil. The Covenant net debt/Covenant adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 9.75x at 30 June 2025; EBITDA forecasts for Q3 2025 are to ensure compliance with the minimum ratio requirement of 8.34x to be met at 30 September 2025.

Title: No drama in Stockholm; Rare Earths and Trump's China shift; Beijing floods; Ok to say overcapacity, New Shaolin Temple Abbot

Time Published: 2025-07-30T00:19:53Z
Full Content:
The US-China Stockholm talks have concluded. Both sides said they went well, without giving details. The Chinese side said they agreed on an extension, the US side said President Trump has to approve it when they brief him Wednesday. USTR head Jamieson Greer in comments after the meeting reiterated the importance of rare earths: We were there in the first purpose to confirm the implementation of what was agreed in London in terms of accelerating the flow of rare earth magnets from China to US companies and then were able to discuss further how to make sure that the entire US supply chain including those that go through third countries could be accelerated. Earlier Tuesday President Trump in a post to Truth Social expressed his frustration at recent media reports that he has softened on China: The bigger reason for the Trump Administration shift on China may be rare earth magnets, and this quote from the Financial Times’ Trump blocks Taiwan’s President Lai from New York stopover highlights the massive leverage Xi has created with rare earths: In addition to concerns about derailing a summit, some officials say the US needs to “hide and bide” with respect to China. The phrase — which was used by China’s former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping — is being invoked to explain that the rare earths leverage China has created over the US limits Washington’s ability to take tough actions against Beijing. Some Trump defenders are using this quote to argue Trump has no choice but to soften the US stance towards China. But if that is the case then he was really poorly served by Treasury Secretary Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnick et al because they should not have been surprised that China had built up this leverage. Instead they went full bore ahead with bad information (remember Bessent saying China is playing with a pair of twos?) and a less robust hand than they realized and ended up making Trump look weak, while giving Xi a win he can tout domestically and to the rest of the world, as the leader who stood up to Trump and the US. Summary of today’s top items: 1. US-China Stockholm talks 2. At least 30 dead in Beijing flooding - The worst of the flooding around Beijing may be over, and so far the offial death toll is 30, with a number of people still missing. A retirement home in Miyun, Beijing was inundated. Officially everyone was rescued but there are rumors going around that not all residents with mobility issues got out. I hope those rumors are wrong. 3. New abbot for Shaolin Temple - Shi Yinle, abbot of the White Horse Temple in Luoyang, is the new abbot of Shaolin Temple, replacing the fallen Shi Yongxin. In May during his Henan inspection tour Xi visited the White Horse Temple and was shown with Shi Yinle. Was that visit also an “interview” for this new post? 4. Two Bank of China overseas executives in trouble - Jiang Xu, president of BOC’s Peru subsidiary, is an expert in factoring, Caixin noted in its exclusive article on the cases. I am speculating here, but given his expertise and experience in factoring, and the recent exit ban of the American Wells Fargo executive who built their international factoring business, is there possibly some large factoring mess we have not yet heard about? 5. It is OK to say “overcapacity” again - Caixin has a brutal article on the state of the PRC auto industry: For over a decade, Beijing nurtured its nascent NEV industry with generous subsidies, creating a gold rush. Many local governments, eager for investment and jobs, offered lavish incentives to attract automakers.“In many cases, carmakers didn’t have to pay a cent to build new production capacity,” said a person familiar with China’s auto policy planning. “Once production targets were agreed — say, an annual capacity of 200,000 units — the local government would fund the factory through its affiliated investment platforms.”After years of rapid expansion, most automakers are now mired in overcapacity. By May 2022, China’s passenger car inventory had already surpassed 3 million units, and it has remained above that level since, hitting a five-year high of 3.45 million units in May 2025. With too many factories chasing too few buyers, a price war was almost inevitable.Some local governments went even further, directing state capital to set up joint ventures or prop up underperforming companies, which has in some cases hampered the market’s ability to weed out the chaff and hindered consolidation. People paying attention knew this was the case, but media being this blunt about it feels like a bit of a shift, one that fits with the intensifying campaign talking up addressing “involution” and overcapacity. Thanks for reading. U.S. and China Fail to Reach Immediate Deal to Prolong Trade Truce - The New York Times Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, said that he would discuss the situation with his top advisers on Wednesday and “either approve it or not.” He appeared to indicate at one point that the talks between the United States and China had hit some unspecified roadblocks. “I said, ‘Oh, here we go again,’” Mr. Trump said, before adding, “Today it worked out.”..When pressed to name concessions the U.S. side achieved from the Chinese side, Mr. Greer cited China’s decision to grant U.S. companies licenses to rare earths.“They blocked all of their rare earth magnets, and now they are getting them,” Mr. Greer said.Mr. Greer also said tariff levels on some Chinese imports could snap back to above 80 percent if a truce was not extended by Aug. 12. But Mr. Bessent downplayed that possibility. Trump Tariffs: US, China Agree to Continue Talks on a Truce Extension - Bloomberg At issue in the ongoing dialog is how the two countries seek to maintain a stable trading relationship while applying barriers like tariffs and export controls to limit each other’s progress in critical sectors ranging from battery technology and defense to semiconductors.Greer said the US wants assurances that critical materials like magnets keep flowing so the two sides can focus on other priorities. “We don’t ever want to talk about magnets again,” he said.Greer said the resumption of China’s rare earths exports is Beijing’s biggest concession so far. Asked if the US made any commitments to China on its pending 232 investigations, Greer said China asked for status updates on them, but stressed that the eventual duties would be applied globally and not have any exemptions for particular countries. China, US trade talks in-depth, candid, constructive: China intl trade representative - Global Times The trade and economic teams of China and the United States held in-depth, candid and constructive exchanges over important topics of mutual interest, a senior Chinese official said in Sweden on Tuesday, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Li Chenggang, China international trade representative with the Ministry of Commerce and vice minister of commerce, made the remarks when briefing the press following the new round of economic and trade talks in Stockholm, per Xinhua.The two sides will continue pushing for the continued extension of the pause on 24 percent of reciprocal tariffs of the U.S. side, as well as counter measures of the Chinese side, said Li. Upholding sincerity, principles to advance China-U.S. economic, trade relations - People's Daily Zhong Sheng Differences between countries are inevitable; the key lies in how they are addressed. Dialogue and consultation provide not only a more efficient path forward, but also serve to forestall unnecessary costs. China's development interests must not be compromised. The two sides should explore possible solutions through dialogue based on mutual respect. Upholding the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation in economic and trade consultations aligns with the expectations of both peoples and the wider international community.Sincerity, however, does not imply compromising on principles. Consultations have bottom lines, and cooperation must be grounded in clear principles. Any dialogue must be conducted based on mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit.What China seeks to safeguard is not only its own legitimate rights and interests, but also international fairness and justice. China's development achievements are the result of the hard work of the Chinese people, not bestowed by others, nor achieved at the expense of other countries. These achievements must not be undermined, and China's right to development cannot be denied.In the face of U.S. tariff blackmail, investment restrictions, and technological blockades, China's determination to defend its legitimate rights and interests remains unwavering, and its capabilities are evident to all.

[As I noted in the Monday newsletter] Those meetings were abruptly canceled by the U.S. after Xi urged Trump to limit U.S. engagement with Taiwan during a phone call earlier in June, the two people said. Trump may not replace Biden-era AI rule | Semafor The Trump administration is easing off its tough-on-China approach to technology export controls as it searches for leverage in trade talks and looks to propel US dominance on artificial intelligence. The administration is debating whether to scrap its plans to replace a Biden-era rule that set up a global framework for export controls designed to prevent US-designed AI technology like chips from flowing to China or Russia, two industry sources told Semafor. That’s not the only sign of a less hawkish approach to AI policy; the administration’s new AI plan called for more open-source and open-weight models despite concerns that they could benefit Beijing. And US officials recently approved the sale of certain semiconductors produced by Nvidia to China, drawing bipartisan scrutiny on Capitol Hill. “I think it’s a mistake,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told Semafor of the administration’s approval of selling those chips. “Because all they’re doing is helping China. I just think it’s a huge mistake. And I’m not sure, I think some CEOs talked the president into it. I hope he turns out to be right, but I wouldn’t have done it.” In an era of global crises and polarization, journalism has a crucial role in bridging divides.

Abbot of Luoyang’s White House Temple appointed as new abbot of Shaolin - Global Times Shi Yinle, abbot of the White Horse Temple in Luoyang, Central China's Henan Province, has reportedly assumed the position of abbot of the Shaolin Temple, according to a statement from the Shaolin Temple following the launch of an investigation into its former abbot.According to a release from the Shaolin Temple on Tuesday, in accordance with the regulations on the appointment of abbots in Chinese Buddhist Temples, and upon the democratic deliberation and approval by the monastic community of Shaolin Temple, Venerable Yinle has been ceremoniously invited to assume the position of abbot of Shaolin Temple following due procedures...Shi Yinle previously served as a delegate to the seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and held the position of deputy secretary-general of the Buddhist Association of Henan Province. 习近平在河南考察时强调：坚定信心推动高质量发展高效能治理 奋力谱写中原大地推进中国式现代化新篇章__中国政府网 Subsequently, Xi Jinping visited the White Horse Temple, which was first built during the Eastern Han Dynasty, to conduct an inspection. He gained a detailed understanding of the Sinicization of Buddhism and the protection of temple cultural relics. He pointed out that the White Horse Temple has witnessed the introduction, development, and continuous Sinicization of Buddhism. History has proven that adhering to the direction of the Sinicization of religion in China is entirely correct. It is necessary to actively guide religions to integrate with the outstanding traditional Chinese culture and adapt to socialist society.随后，习近平来到始建于东汉年间的白马寺考察，详细了解佛教中国化和寺院文物保护情况。他指出，白马寺见证了佛教传入、发展并不断中国化的进程。历史证明，坚持我国宗教中国化方向是完全正确的，要积极引导宗教同中华优秀传统文化相融合、与社会主义社会相适应。 Here he is with the new abbot of Shaolin Temple: China’s Shaolin Temple gets a new abbot after money, sex scandals fell Shi Yongxin | South China Morning Post The abbot of White Horse Temple, Shi Yinle, will replace him, according to a brief statement from the Shaolin Temple on Tuesday.“In accordance with the regulations on the appointment of abbots of Chinese Buddhist Temples, after democratic evaluation and approval by the Shaolin Temple and following the relevant procedures, Venerable Yinle was invited to be the abbot of the Shaolin Temple,” the one-paragraph statement said...On Tuesday, the heart of the complex – the fangzhang yuan – was found sealed off by green barriers on all sides. A sign posted outside the area, which serves as abbot’s reception courtyard, stated that this was for “cultural relic preservation”.A nearby stone stele, erected in 1999 to commemorate Shi’s leadership, had its inscription covered, its celebratory message obscured from view. Faith, Greed, and Power: The Unraveling of the Shaolin Kingdom - Caixin Before he formally took the reins in the mid-1990s, Shi’s strategy was clear: take the Shaolin brand to the world. Acknowledging the power of The Shaolin Temple movie, he saw that the temple’s connection to the outside world was its unique blend of Zen and martial arts. He founded the Shaolin Warrior Monk Troupe, which debuted to acclaim in 1989 and soon embarked on international tours, including a historic 1993 visit to Taiwan that marked the first cross-strait religious exchange in over four decades.His masterstroke came in 1995. Seizing on the temple’s 1,500th anniversary, the 30-year-old Shi organized a lavish, five-day celebration against the wishes of skeptical officials. In his memoir, he recounts his audacious lobbying campaign, which included tracking down the Henan provincial party secretary on an overnight train to Beijing to personally make his case during a two-hour pitch. The gamble worked. The festival drew thousands of guests from over 17 countries and was covered by hundreds of journalists. As a newly installed bell tolled for the first time in 60 years, Shi cemented his position as the temple’s undisputed leader.His political star rose in tandem. He became a delegate to the National People’s Congress and president of the Henan Buddhist Association. In August 1999, at the age of 34, Shi Yongxin was formally installed as the 30th abbot of the Shaolin Temple in a ceremony attended by top religious leaders and dozens of government officials. The boy who came to learn kung fu was now the master of China’s most famous monastery. He was ready to take it into the 21st century. Caixin Exclusive: Two Heads of Bank of China’s Overseas Arms Unreachable Two presidents at Bank of China Ltd.’s (BOC) overseas arms have become unreachable, with one detained by Chinese graft-busters, Caixin learned from sources with knowledge of the matter.While the exact reasons remain unclear, Jia Tianbing and Jiang Xu — presidents of BOC’s Macao branch and Peru subsidiary, respectively — are likely to have been ensnared in the country’s long-running crackdown on corruption in finance.The campaign has involved senior officials at the overseas offices of China’s “Big Four” state-owned commercial banks, including BOC and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (ICBC)...Industry insiders told Caixin that Jiang Xu is highly experienced in factoring, a type of financial service that can help businesses get cash quickly by selling their unpaid invoices to a bank. His track record in this vein included a stint at the Amsterdam-based Factors Chain International, a global association for the receivables finance industry. 中行境外机构地震 多名现任“一把手”失联_金融我闻_财新网 ‘Pervasive sense of fear’: China steps up exit bans as US tensions flare - Financial Times One person, who learned of their exit ban at airport customs, recalled that a “light turned red and a weird siren rang out”. An officer informed them of the ban and handed over a telephone number to call for more information. No one ever picked up, they said.An investor who was also stopped at the airport said his heart began to pound. “I desperately searched my memory for anything I could possibly have done wrong,” he said. “I was consumed with dread.

Caixin In Depth: China’s Surging Auto Sales Mask an Industry in Crisis Over the past two and a half years, China’s auto industry has been gripped by a relentless price war amid a cycle of self-destructive hyper competition, termed “involution.” While price wars are a common feature of commercial competition, in China’s case, the price war has failed to achieve one of its supposed outcomes — accelerating industry consolidation. In fact, the market share of the 15 biggest automakers by sales shrank by 1.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 92.2%, according to CAAM...For over a decade, Beijing nurtured its nascent NEV industry with generous subsidies, creating a gold rush. Many local governments, eager for investment and jobs, offered lavish incentives to attract automakers.“In many cases, carmakers didn’t have to pay a cent to build new production capacity,” said a person familiar with China’s auto policy planning. “Once production targets were agreed — say, an annual capacity of 200,000 units — the local government would fund the factory through its affiliated investment platforms.”After years of rapid expansion, most automakers are now mired in overcapacity. By May 2022, China’s passenger car inventory had already surpassed 3 million units, and it has remained above that level since, hitting a five-year high of 3.45 million units in May 2025. With too many factories chasing too few buyers, a price war was almost inevitable.Some local governments went even further, directing state capital to set up joint ventures or prop up underperforming companies, which has in some cases hampered the market’s ability to weed out the chaff and hindered consolidation.

Analysts say that the expansion of domestic demand will still need to be supported by fiscal and monetary policy, including the use of ultra-long state bonds toward consumer trade-in programs. Others say efforts to revitalize urban development will also be another important tool to increase domestic demand. On “involution,” analysts say the focus will be the orderly phasing out of “backward industrial capacity,” and some called the anti involution efforts China’s “supply-side reform 2.0.” On housing, some experts predict that more measures — like further relaxation of restrictive rules in first-tier cities — will likely be rolled out in the latter half of the year. China Social Spending Hits Highest Level in Nearly Two Decades - Bloomberg While Beijing is channeling less on-budget investment into infrastructure, expenditure that covers outlays ranging from education to employment and social security climbed to nearly 5.7 trillion yuan ($795 billion) in the first half — the highest for the period since the data series began in 2007.

According to the data, economic expectations are heating up, with a notable shift in household consumption intentions.One key finding: around 30% of surveyed residents indicated plans to increase their spending on travel—reflecting growing consumer confidence and a potential rebound in the services and tourism sectors.In the survey on residents’ intentions regarding consumption, saving, and investment, in the second quarter, 63.8% of residents preferred “more saving,” 23.3% preferred “more consumption,” and 12.9% preferred “more investment.” The top five investment methods favored by residents were, in order: “non-principal-guaranteed wealth management products from banks,” “fund and trust products,” “stocks,” “bonds,” and “non-consumption insurance.” The proportion of residents choosing these five types of investments were 34.8%, 24.7%, 16.3%, 15.3%, and 9.8%, respectively. China is also Fighting a Trade War with Europe (and Winning) | Council on Foreign Relations Europe is clearly getting hit hard by China’s industrial policy successes—and now by a weak yuan. Its response has been inadequate. Time for Europe to step up with a counter industrial policy of its own and start to take the issues around China’s macroeconomic imbalances seriously. China struggles to break its addiction to manufacturing - Financial Times After previously denying the existence of overcapacity — Xi during a trip to France last year said there was no such thing — Qiushi, the Communist party magazine, last month not only used the term but also laid out a forensic analysis of its causes. A swath of measures to try to shore up prices have followed. But with China’s investment in manufacturing still rising at a blistering pace — up 7.5 per cent this year after a 9.5 per cent rise in 2024 — there is no end in sight. Yan Se, assistant professor in the department of applied economics at the Guanghua School of Management in Peking University, said at a recent seminar that China’s share of global manufacturing value-added could rise to 40 per cent in the next five years, from about 27 per cent now. “深学笃行阐释习近平经济思想2025年会”在京举办-新华网 In this pivotal year marking the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the strategic planning of the 15th Five-Year Plan, the “2025 Annual Conference on In-Depth Study and Interpretation of Xi Jinping Economic Thought” was held in Beijing on July 29.

Marcos said that the promotion of modernizing the Philippine military is a direct response to the changing situation in the South China Sea, and that the United States deploying mid-range missiles and the two countries jointly building arsenal bases are conducive to preparations for possible future situations. Other sources said that Japan has exported six Abukuma-class destroyer escorts to the Philippines.In response, Guo said that China has always opposed attempts to increase military alliance and engage in military deployment and operation targeting others under the pretext of the South China Sea issue. Xi sends message to World Youth Conference for Peace-Xinhua Noting that this year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, Xi said in the message that the Chinese people, together with people around the world, completely defeated fascism and secured a hard-won peace through bloody battles 80 years ago.Xi stressed that the future of peace lies with the youth, voicing the hope that young friends from all countries will take this event as an opportunity to exchange ideas, enhance mutual understanding and build friendships.Xi encouraged them to champion the vision of peace, and contribute to peaceful development and the building of a community with a shared future for humanity.With the theme of "Together for Peace," the conference was co-hosted by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the All-China Youth Federation 李鸿忠出席世界青年和平大会开幕式 宣读习近平主席致信并致辞-新华网 Li Hongzhong, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, attended the opening ceremony of the World Youth Peace Conference in Beijing on the 29th, where he read a congratulatory letter from President Xi Jinping and delivered a speech...中共中央政治局委员、全国人大常委会副委员长李鸿忠29日在京出席世界青年和平大会开幕式，宣读习近平主席致信并致辞。Li emphasized that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government will, as always, create favorable conditions for the growth and development of young people, and will encourage and support young people from China and abroad to strengthen exchanges, deepen friendship, and enhance cooperation, working together to build a bright future for a community with a shared future for mankind.李鸿忠强调，中国共产党和中国政府将一如既往为青年成长和发展创造良好条件，鼓励并支持中外青年加强交流、增进友谊、深化协作，携手共创构建人类命运共同体的美好未来。The theme of the World Youth Peace Conference is “Together for Peace.” More than 3,000 participants, including youth representatives from over 130 countries across five continents, international students in China, and young representatives from various sectors of Chinese society, attended the event.世界青年和平大会主题为“一起为和平”，全球五大洲130多个国家的青年代表、各国在华留学生和我国各界青年代表等3000多人参会。 China embraces US YouTubers in push to enhance soft power - Nikkei Asia MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has amassed over 416 million subscribers on YouTube, where he is known for extravagant videos often featuring lavish prizes for participants. On Saturday, he made his livestream debut on a Chinese video platform, broadcasting on the Kuaishou short-video app."I've never been live in China before, so I'm excited to say hi," MrBeast said at the beginning of the livestream, which quickly gained 150,000 viewers. Initially scheduled to last an hour, the livestream ended after just 11 minutes, as MrBeast appeared frustrated that he couldn't read the Chinese comments. He said he would try again after figuring out how to translate them.Apart from Kuaishou, he has also launched accounts on the Bilibili video-streaming platform and the Weibo microblogging app, quickly gaining millions of followers. China urged to control narrative and engage Asia to counteract the West: ‘own the story’ | South China Morning Post Zheng Yongnian, a prominent political scientist, said China must take a leading role in shaping the “Asian narrative” with an open and inclusive mind, invite more Asian scholars to engage, seek common ground and promote dialogue to push back against an entrenched dominance of Western discourse.Asian values were rooted in the principle of “harmony and diversity” and the region should return to its tradition of consensus-based politics, he said in an interview published on July 17 by China International Communications Group (CICG) Asia-Pacific, a state-owned organisation operated by the Communist Party’s Central Propaganda Department.“For a long time, Western discourse held absolute dominance, and most Chinese scholars were educated within that framework. As a result, China had struggled to project its voice internationally. Today, that is beginning to change – but it will take time,” he said. China's police chief meets Interpol secretary general-Xinhua State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong met with Valdecy Urquiza, secretary general of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) here on Tuesday, calling for deepening cooperation in fields such as combating transnational crime.China firmly supports Interpol's leading role in the multilateral law enforcement frameworks, said Wang, adding that the Chinese side stands ready to work with the organization to implement the Global Security Initiative and ensure the success of the 94th Interpol General Assembly.Wang called on both sides to strengthen cooperation in areas such as cracking down on transnational crime and enhancing law enforcement capacity, in order to jointly build a community with a shared future for humanity that features universal security. U.S. military expands in Palau amid China's growing influence - The Washington Post The U.S. military will next year upgrade Palau’s main harbor, usually frequented by dive boats full of tourists heading to emerald lagoons, so that American warships can enter the Pacific island nation’s narrow channels and dock here...Complicating that plan, however, is a Chinese-owned hotel overlooking Malakal Harbor that U.S. and Palauan officials worry could be used for surveillance.Across Palau, Chinese businesses and developers have leased land near a half-dozen strategic locations where the United States is beefing up efforts to detect and deter China’s growing reach into the region, according to intelligence and security documents and interviews with 20 American, Palauan and Taiwanese officials. Beijing bolsters its position in the Indo-Pacific with little US pushback | Brookings While the Trump administration has been preoccupied with its trade war with Beijing, Beijing has adopted a two-pronged approach to bolster its own position in the Indo-Pacific region: pushing harder against those in the region that challenge China’s sovereignty claims, while pulling its stalwart partners and so-called swing states closer into its orbit. China has been steadily advancing its territorial claims along its periphery without eliciting much discernible pushback from the Trump administration. As Brookings scholar Lynn Kuok has noted, China in April “made its first on-the-ground, formal assertion of sovereignty over a previously unoccupied land feature in the South China Sea in more than a decade.” Meanwhile, Beijing has continued to ramp up pressure on Taiwan—most notably during its Strait Thunder-2025A exercise in April. These activities are likely designed to establish a “new normal” for Beijing’s coercive activities during the Trump administration. Simultaneously, China has pursued a “charm offensive” with friendly countries and so-called swing states in Southeast Asia.From Beijing’s perspective, there are a number of compelling reasons to pursue this two-pronged strategy. President Donald Trump and his top foreign policy officials are utterly distracted by their multifront trade war, strikes on Iran, and their quixotic efforts to resolve the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The dearth of bandwidth at the top is compounded by the lack of staffing to address Beijing’s subtle salami slicing. Moreover, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his European Union counterpart in July that Beijing was worried that the United States would turn its full attention to China and the Indo-Pacific after the end of the Ukraine war, an assessment that would only give additional impetus to Beijing to consolidate its position in the region sooner rather than later.Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s punitive and erratic tariff policy provides an opening for China to make headway with countries in the region at very little cost. Three terrorists who masterminded attack on Chinese engineers in Karachi in Nov killed in Pakistan counterterrorism operation: media - Global Times Three terrorists, including the mastermind behind the November 2024 attack on Chinese engineers, were killed during a counterterrorism operation in Karachi city in Pakistan, said Pakistan officials as reported by the Dawn. “A terrorist who masterminded an attack on Chinese engineers in November last year has been killed during an operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area,” said Additional Inspector-General of Police, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Azad Khan, per the Dawn. Khan said the slain terrorist was identified as Zafran, while two of his accomplices were also killed in the operation, according to the report. China’s J-20 stealth aircraft flew through the Tsushima Strait. Did anybody else notice? | South China Morning Post The Chinese air force’s most advanced J-20 stealth fighter has flown through the strategic Tsushima Strait near Japan, an apparent first not reported by any other armed forces with a presence in the region.In a series aired on Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV reported that the elite air force unit, the First Fighter Brigade, now “flies missions over the Bashi Channel and Tsushima Strait, and conducts patrols around Taiwan”. The unit was among the first to receive the new-generation aircraft and while the report did not refer to the J-20 directly, footage of the stealth fighter was shown throughout the segment, leaving little doubt about the aircraft involved. China says new Mazu weather warning AI will help developing nations prepare for disaster | South China Morning Post Mazu is one of the most revered Chinese deities in Southeast Asia, sometimes conflated with the Virgin Mary. The Multi-hazard Alert Zero-gap and Universal (Mazu) system was purpose-built for global reach, according to China’s national weather service. The initiative, which was unveiled at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on Saturday, is expected to support partner countries under China’s Belt and Road Initiative by introducing critical early warning capabilities. Battle to uphold correct view of history continues after long-ended WWII - China Military The distortion of WWII history is no longer a purely academic debate or a so-called difference in memory, but has become a deliberate manipulation serving today's geopolitical struggles. For example, certain forces in the US and Europe are trying to erase the Soviet Union's significant contribution and immense sacrifices in defeating Nazi Germany, even going so far as to rewrite WWII history and whitewash Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators. The West's selective memory of WWII has become a tool for geopolitical rivalry, amounting to an act of arrogance and betrayal against historical truth.For some time now, mainstream Western discourse has fallen into a Normandy-centered narrative trap when commemorating the WWII. Certain voices highlight the D-Day landings as the decisive turning point of the anti-fascist war, while deliberately downplaying or ignoring the decisive contributions made on other fronts. The ironclad fact that the Soviet Union sacrificed 27 million lives and countless wounded on the Eastern Front is now marginalized as a mere "footnote" under today's Western "political correctness."In the East, right-wing forces in Japan still refuse to face up to their history of aggression, repeatedly attempting to whitewash the militarist invasions of the past, which continues to raise alarm among neighbouring Asian countries and their people. If, in the case of the European theatre, the West's historical manipulation often takes the form of distortion and "reinvention", then when it comes to the Eastern, they tend to simply look the other way, or even tolerate Japan's flawed historical perception out of the pragmatic need to win it over politically. The Chinese people, through the bloody war of resistance, pinned down and destroyed the vast majority of the Japanese militarist army's main forces. At the cost of more than 35 million lives lost and wounded, China made a decisive contribution to the final victory on the Eastern battlefield of the World Anti-Fascist War. Without the Chinese people's determined resistance, the history of Asia, and even the world, could well have been rewritten. Taiwan foreign ministry denies Financial Times report on Lai's trip - Focus Taiwan President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) currently has no plans to travel overseas, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesperson Hsiao Kuangwei (蕭光偉) said Tuesday, denying media reports that Lai's planned trip to Paraguay through New York was blocked by the United States. At a routine MOFA press briefing, Hsiao denied a Financial Times report that said Lai's planned visits to diplomatic allies Paraguay, Guatemala, and Belize were delayed or cancelled due to U.S. President Donald Trump blocking a stopover in New York following protests from China. China firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between US and Taiwan island: FM responds to Trump administration’s reported block of Lai’s stopover - Global Times In response to a question that whether Chinese government has contacted the US government over Bloomberg's report that Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te appeared to call off South America trip after the Trump administration didn't greenlight his stopover in the US, Chinese FM spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Tuesday that "First of all, Taiwan is a province of China, and there is no such thing as a president."China has taken note of the relevant reports. I would like to emphasize that the Chinese government firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between the US and the island of Taiwan, and resolutely opposes the leader of the Taiwan region recklessly visiting the US under any name or pretext. This position is consistent, clear, and firm, said Guo. Blocking anti-Japanese war veterans from visiting mainland exposes Lai’s betrayal of the nation: Global Times editorial - Global Times What is both shocking and infuriating is that the DPP authorities not only refuse to hold commemorative events for the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, but also smear the participation of veteran soldiers from Taiwan in mainland's commemorations as "united front tactics" and "cognitive warfare." They have even gone so far as to threaten these veterans with the revocation of their pensions, which has completely torn off Lai's hypocritical mask and laid bare the DPP's true nature as a "green terror" regime rooted in authoritarianism.On the issue of wartime history, the DPP authorities have long pushed for "de-Sinicization," deliberately obscuring and distorting Taiwan's historical role in the war, and forcibly severing the deep-rooted blood ties between the residents of Taiwan and the Chinese nation. They seek to make the younger generation forget the bloody sacrifices of their forebears and to detach Taiwan society from its historical identity as part of the Chinese nation. Such shameless manipulation is not only a grave betrayal of historical truth but also a disgraceful insult to the martyrs who gave their lives in the war. Taiwan mulls chip restrictions amid South Africa name change row - Focus Taiwan Taiwan is considering restricting semiconductor exports to South Africa in response to what it described as a "crude" downgrade of its diplomatic presence in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday. To "safeguard national sovereignty and dignity, we are discussing countermeasures with relevant government agencies, including restricting chip exports to South Africa," Philippe Yen (顏嘉良), director-general for MOFA's Department of West Asian and African Affairs, said at a news briefing. Exclusive: Nvidia orders 300,000 H20 chips from TSMC due to robust China demand, sources say | Reuters The new orders with Taiwan's TMSC would add to existing inventory of 600,000 to 700,000 H20 chips, according to the sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.For comparison purposes, Nvidia sold around 1 million H20 chips in 2024, according to U.S. research firm SemiAnalysis...Nvidia needs to obtain export licenses from the U.S. government to ship the H20 chips. It said in mid-July it had been assured by authorities that it would get them soon.The U.S. Department of Commerce has yet to approve those licenses, one of the sources and a third source said. China's latest AI model claims to be even cheaper to use than DeepSeek Startup Z.ai, formerly known as Zhipu, announced Monday that its new GLM-4.5 AI model would cost less than DeepSeek to use. Like DeepSeek, the new model is also open source and can be downloaded for free. At about half the size of DeepSeek’s model, GLM-4.5 only needs eight Nvidia H20 chips to operate, Z.ai CEO Zhang Peng told CNBC on Monday. China’s tech hub Shenzhen mandates leniency for innovators whose state-funded projects fail | South China Morning Post Authorities in China’s southern tech hub of Shenzhen have called for leniency towards innovators whose government-funded projects fail or do not pass evaluation. The first policy statement of its kind from the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission comes as China aims to cement the city’s status as a hi-tech powerhouse and reduce reliance on foreign technology amid a sustained strategic rivalry with the United States. The new rules applied to all universities, hospitals and companies that undertake technical innovation with government financial aid, the commission said in a statement on its website last Monday. How Cursor’s Global Success Is Lifted by China — The Information When a powerful typhoon battered Guangzhou earlier this month, hundreds of programmers in the southern Chinese city braved torrential rain and gusting wind to show up to an event they’d been waiting for: Cursor’s first meetup in the city. More than 300 people turned out to watch a pre-recorded video of Eric Zakariasson, a San Francisco–based employee of Cursor’s parent, Anysphere, responding to questions submitted by participants. Later, attendees discussed how to use Cursor for development of artificial intelligent agents, academic research and retail sector applications. The four-hour gathering, part of a global Cursor program designed to foster use of the AI coding tool, illustrated Cursor’s quietly growing popularity in China, which has helped fuel the company’s global success.

Title: GraniteShares Announces Reverse Split of CONI

Full Content:
July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged.

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates.

Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate.

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

Title: The Fed is expected to hold rates steady as Trump pushes for a cut

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The Federal Reserve has so far resisted President Donald Trump's aggressive pressure campaign to throw inflation concerns out and attempt to boost the U.S. economy with lower interest rates. That's expected to continue Wednesday, as the central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged. If so, that’s likely to annoy Trump, who is already reshaping the global economy with his tariffs. The Fed’s rate setting committee began its two-day meeting Tuesday. Market projections and analysts expect it won't cut its key rate. “We expect Chair Powell to reiterate his view that the Fed can afford to remain on hold to assess the tariff impact as long as the U.S. economy and labor market remain strong,” analysts with financial group Nomura said in a note published Friday. “Data released lately have pointed to nascent signs of tariff-induced price pressures. Additionally, growth data have remained robust.” The central bank, which is tasked with using its influential interest rates to balance inflation and unemployment, is weighing whether the time is right to loosen the flow of cash into the economy at the risk of rising prices. Most data indicates the economy is in solid shape. At 4.1%, the unemployment rate is relatively low — though the median time it takes an unemployed person to find a job has surged to more than 10 weeks. Stocks are at all-time highs, in large part thanks to bets on the potential for artificial intelligence to transform companies' bottom lines. The biggest wild card is inflation. For the first five months of Trump's second term, inflation readings were relatively subdued. But in June, the economy began to show the first signs of increased price pressures as a result of the tariffs, with price growth for goods such as apparel, appliances and toys accelerating. Economic forecasters and business surveys suggest tariffs are likely to continue to feed into higher consumer prices. That has complicated the picture for the Fed. An ironic twist: Jerome Powell has said the Fed might have cut already were it not for Trump initiating his sprawling and volatile tariff policy as inflation continued to cool. Trump has been especially hard on Powell, raising fears in Washington and Wall Street that he may try to fire the Fed chair. For now, Trump has seemingly backed off the idea, though some experts say it is unclear whether he has the legal authority to do so anyway. Still, Trump and administration officials have continued to put the squeeze on Powell and the Fed — raising concerns about the central bank’s long-standing independence and immunity to political interference. Trump has said cutting rates would boost the economy by making it cheaper to borrow money and also reduce the amount that the U.S. government has to pay on its debts. Powell has showed no signs he would budge to political pressure. The Fed’s key rate is set by a group called the Federal Open Market Committee. Powell is head of the panel, but it includes 11 other members — two of whom, like Powell, were appointed by Trump during his first term. Those two, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, have openly called for lowering rates. They argue that the pace of price growth has been largely contained, that any bump in costs from tariffs will be short lived and that there are signs of accelerated weakening in the job market. The committee meets eight times a year to discuss monetary policy, including whether to raise, lower or hold rates steady. The Fed chair serves as the public face of that committee and leads those meetings, so the central bank's head can have some influence over the debate and direction of the discussion. It only takes a simple majority of the committee to vote in favor of a rate change. Forecasters have said Bowman and Waller may dissent from this week's likely decision to hold pat. The FOMC has not registered more than one dissent in more than three decades, something that may reflect ongoing uncertainty about the current state of the economy, but could also suggest political concerns have entered the discussion. If the FOMC does not lower rates this month, it is likely to before the end of the year. As of Tuesday, markets pegged the chances of a cut in September above 60%. A cut in the Fed's key rate may not immediately translate into reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, cars or credit cards. The reason: The Fed targets short-term interest rates, not borrowing costs spread out over multiple years. In other words, a decline in the Fed’s target interest rate does not immediately lead to a comparable decline in consumer-facing interest rates — even if lenders use the Fed as a benchmark. Home loans are especially disconnected from the Fed’s short-term borrowing targets. Instead, banks and other lenders set mortgage rates using a range of factors, with a major one being the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds. Since the onset of the Covid pandemic, the 10-year rate has steadily climbed to about 4.5%, helping lift mortgage rates to about 6.5%. The greatest driver of interest rates is inflation expectations. If investors expect price growth to erode purchasing power, they will start asking for higher interest rates. Right now, the Federal Reserve believes inflation expectations are mostly in check, although Trump’s tariffs have introduced a persistent level of uncertainty. The FOMC's decision to hold its key rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% this year has helped keep a lid on inflation, by curbing overall demand in the economy. If Powell were to be removed, analysts say, it is likely that inflation expectations would become “unanchored” if it suddenly becomes easier for businesses to raise prices assuming demand increases. That would lead to faster inflation, and thus higher interest rates in the economy — even if the FOMC were to vote for a cut. That includes the cost of borrowing for the federal government. Anything that creates major uncertainty among investors about the stability of the U.S. economy can cause Treasury yields to rise. Less demand for Treasury bonds means the federal government has to pay a higher yield to convince investors to buy them. If Trump were to fire Powell, investors have warned that 10-year Treasury yields would increase. That would help push home mortgage rates higher. There’s also concern that firing Powell would trigger stock market volatility. It already ramped up earlier this month, as speculation about the future of Powell’s job reached a fever pitch. “Long story short, it’s not a pretty picture,” analysts with Capital Economics said in a recent note to clients on how the market would respond if Trump tried to remove Powell. Still, even if Powell were sidelined, the next central banker up — Vice Chairman Philip Jefferson, who was appointed by then-President Joe Biden — hasn’t exactly embraced rate cuts recently. In May, he said the Fed’s policy was in “a very good place” and that the central bank could afford to be patient. Shannon Pettypiece is senior policy reporter for NBC News.

Title: AI Fears Become Reality In The Tech Industry

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Fears of artificial intelligence costing people their jobs are already proving to be true. Or at the very least, CEOs are now admitting to the technology’s impact as AI-related layoffs ramp up, especially in the tech industry, reports Forbes’ Richard Nieva. Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman is just the latest to say out loud that AI is already a threat to all kinds of jobs—including his. In an April memo to his 1,200 employees, he wrote: “AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it’s coming for my job too.” “I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, ‘Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?’” Kaufman tells Forbes now. “I felt like this needed validation from me—that they aren’t imagining stuff.” He joins the likes of Andy Jassy at Amazon, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and Shopify’s Tobi Lutke in admitting that AI will replace humans in white-collar jobs, some going as far as predicting a “white-collar bloodbath.” The impacts are already being felt, particularly for young coders and entry-level workers. The total number of employed entry-level developers from ages 18 to 25 has dropped “slightly” since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT, said Ruyu Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI. But not everything can, or should, be automated just yet. Take the buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, for example, which last year slashed its workforce by 40% in part to the company’s investments in AI. A year later, it launched a massive recruiting push for human customer service agents. “We have noticed that in a world where everything is automated,” Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom told Forbes, “people put a premium on the human experience.” Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter. Why mastering “systems-thinking” skills could protect your job from AI. What to do when someone is hired above you. Amid all the hype, here’s why you may not need an AI agent. News from the world of work. Looking for lower costs, different lifestyles and less toxic politics, more Americans are considering retiring abroad. In its annual Best Places To Retire Abroad, list, Forbes ranked the 24 countries and 96 spots that could make the most sense for retirees looking outside the U.S. Beloved office snacks might soon be a thing of the past, thanks to Congress. Despite luring workers back into the office with the promise of free food, employers will no longer be able to deduct the cost of the food they provide for their employees as part of President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The only exceptions: restaurants and the Alaskan fishing industry. One seemingly innocuous kiss cam at a Boston Coldplay concert has caused quite the workplace drama at tech startup Astronomer, pushing the company into the internet’s spotlight. Former CEO Andy Byron stepped down after being caught embracing chief people officer Kristin Cabot at the concert, while the company’s cofounder and chief product officer Pete DeJoy has stepped up as interim chief executive. More than half of U.S. companies are looking to pare back on health benefits as weight loss spending soars, according to Reuters. Increased cost sharing means employers could raise deductibles or maximum out-of-pocket costs, or even look beyond traditional pharmacy benefit managers, which act as middlemen between patients and insurers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2DYvvBPRx4 Could Tesla’s Board Oust Elon Musk?

Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell today, with traders anticipating its stock could climb to all-time highs. Current options pricing suggests traders expect Microsoft stock could move nearly 4% in either direction from recent levels by the end of Friday’s trading session. A move of that scale would lift shares to a fresh record near $531 or drop them to about $494, about where they were at the start of July. The shares hovered around $512 in recent trading, just below Friday's closing high after setting multiple records earlier this month. Microsoft's stock has registered an average post-earnings move of 5% over the past four quarters, falling in three of those instances. April was the exception, when shares jumped 8% the day after earnings as cloud and AI growth drove better-than-expected results. Ahead of Wednesday's earnings report, all 20 brokers covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have "buy" ratings for the stock. Their average price target around $580 represents a 13% premium over Tuesday's closing price just above $512. Wall Street analysts expect Microsoft’s quarterly revenue and profits to have surged year-over-year amid growing AI demand. Wedbush analysts, who recently raised their price target to $600, said the company "is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front," thanks to the adoption of Copilot, its chatbot, and its cloud-computing platform Azure. UPDATE—July 30, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent price values.

Title: Equities March Higher While Fed Asserts Its Independence

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Once again, equities rose for the week (ended July 25th) with the S&P 500 up nearly 1.5%, the Nasdaq just over 1.0%, the Dow just under 1.3%, and even small cap stocks participated (Russell 2000 +0.9%).1 The month to date numbers are positive for each index in the +1.4% to +4.0% range. 2025 year to date appears to be favoring the tech heavy indexes (S&P 500 and Nasdaq) but not so much the old-time industrials (DJIA) or small caps (Russell 2000). Six of the Magnificent 7 rose on the week with Tesla (TSLA -4.1%) the only laggard.2 Microsoft (MSFT) closed on Friday at a new record high and Nvidia posted a new high on Thursday (July 24th). It’s been quite a run for stocks since the April lows. Two stocks that don’t seem to be participating are Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA). Apple is off its high by more than -17% and Tesla twice that (-34%).2 And both are off double digits year to date. The table shows that three of the seven (NVDA, MSFT, and META) are up more than 20% this year. Amazon and Google are also up, but in the single digit range.2 Meanwhile, the White House has reached an agreement with Japan, setting tariffs on Japanese imports at 15%.1 Markets reacted positively to that news and now await word on negotiations with the European Union (EU), the results of which appear to be coming shortly. The economies in the EU are softening and the European Central Bank (ECB) has moved their policy rate to 2%, the mid-point of their neutral range. Unlike the ECB, the Fed’s current reference rate (the Fed Funds Rate), at 4.25% to 4.50%, is significantly above the Fed’s stated 2% neutral rate.3 The Fed appears to have some catching-up to do. We don’t have to review the political theater that has been playing out between President Trump and Fed Chair Powell as it’s been all over the news. The independence of the Fed from a sitting Administration was written into the 1913 law establishing the Fed.4 [Imagine the economic damage and resulting inflation if sitting U.S. Presidents controlled the Fed!] The Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) whose next meeting is in the last week of July, is composed of 12 members. They are the seven members of the Board of Governors (nominated by the sitting President and confirmed by the Senate), the President of the NY Fed, and four of the eleven remaining Regional Federal Reserve Bank Presidents (on a rotating basis).5 Powell, while Chair and with a great deal of influence, is only one of the 12 votes on the FOMC. So even if Powell wanted to lower, it isn’t a slam dunk. The Fed knows that it takes several months for its policy changes to have a significant economic impact. A good example is mortgage rates. A lower Fed Funds Rate would likely push mortgage rates down, but the impact on the economy is slow (mortgage by mortgage). As noted below, housing has become slow, so, it would behoove the Fed to lower rates. Thus, as emerging data show a slowing economy, it is only fitting that they lower the Fed Funds Rate. But the Fed knows that its independence is of utmost importance. As a result, we expect the Fed to maintain the Fed Funds Rate where it is (4.25%-4.50%) at its late July meeting if for no other reason than to reassert its independence from the Administration. Markets agree. The Market’s odds of a rate decrease at the July meeting are a scant 2.6%.3 It is also clear that the President now realizes that he can’t force the Fed, that the Fed values its independence and will fight for it, and that if he wants lower interest rates, he will have to wait until the Fed’s September meeting (market odds of a September rate cut are 62%, as the market sees a softening economy making headline news at that time).3 Thus, it behooves the President to stop discussing monetary policy and lay off criticizing the Chairman. If that were to occur, and the Fed lowers in September, the economy would benefit. New home sales rose +0.6% in June to a 627K annual rate.6 But that’s where the good news ends. The consensus expectation was 650K, and the small rise in June barely dented the huge -11.6% falloff in May. The combined May/June performance was the worst two-month performance since late 2022. Inventory levels of those new, unsold, homes were at 9.8 months’ supply at existing sales rates, up from 8.5 months in April and 9.7 in May. As a result, the average price for new homes fell by -2.1% in June from May levels while the median price was off -4.9% from May and down -3.0% from a year ago. Things were no better in the existing home space. Home prices fell -2.7% in June from May levels and existing home sales are now below the levels that occurred at the beginning of the last three Recessions. So, this is a Big Deal! The months’ supply, at current sales rates, has risen from 3.5 months in February to 4.7 months currently, and Zillow reports that 25% of its listings reduced their asking price in June, the highest level for a June month since 2018. It is hard to not conclude that deflation is in the immediate future for residential real estate. Of greater concern here is that the value of that personal residence is the major asset for the vast majority of U.S. households, and lower values will impact future consumption via the “wealth effect,” i.e., consumers spend more/less when their net worth rises/falls. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators (LEI) fell again in June (-0.3%), are down -4% from a year ago, and have been constantly negative for the past three years.7 While some may say these measures are obsolete, we still believe that they impart value to the overall economic picture. Currently, this index is at a ten-year low. It peaked in December 2021 and is down -17.8% since. The Philadelphia Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index came in at -10.3 for July (somewhat better than June’s -25.0, but still negative).8 It has been negative for nine months in a row, and its expectations index for six months hence, at -3.9, has also been negative for six months in a row. The Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index fell to -20 in July from -8 in June. Market expectations were for a -2 reading.9 And the Chicago Fed’s National Activity index (a model with 85 variables) showed up at -0.1 in June, negative now for three months in a row. Companies employing 100 or more must notify workers 60 days prior to layoffs. This is called Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN). Such notifications are up +23% over the past year. This means that weakness will be showing up in the employment data as the year progresses. Equity markets continue to march higher despite growing evidence of a slowing economy. Housing sales, both from new construction and from existing units have slowed precipitously and clearly need lower mortgage rates. Such rates are tied to the 10 Year Treasury yield. Other indicators show slippage in the economy. The Conference Board’s LEI, the Philly Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index, the Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index, and the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index have all been negative for several months. And higher layoffs appear to be just around the corner. Under normal circumstances, the Fed would be moving smoothly toward ease. But these aren’t “normal” times. Recent pressure by the White House on Chairman Powell has put the Fed’s independence in question and at risk. And, while the President has recently backed off, to put an exclamation point on the Fed’s independence, even at the risk of raising the odds of a Recession, it is highly likely that the Fed will not move rates lower at their late July meeting. The market’s odds of a July rate decrease recently fell to 2.6%!3 The next Fed meeting is in September. If the economy really deteriorates, there could be an inter-meeting move lower for the Fed Funds Rate, but that’s highly unlikely. So, as things now stand, the Fed’s next rate reduction will likely occur in September. Stay tuned. Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

The Conference Board’s LEI, the Philly Fed’s Non-Manufacturing Index, the Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Index, and the Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index have all been negative for several months. And higher layoffs appear to be just around the corner. Under normal circumstances, the Fed would be moving smoothly toward ease. But these aren’t “normal” times. Recent pressure by the White House on Chairman Powell has put the Fed’s independence in question and at risk. And, while the President has recently backed off, to put an exclamation point on the Fed’s independence, even at the risk of raising the odds of a Recession, it is highly likely that the Fed will not move rates lower at their late July meeting. The market’s odds of a July rate decrease recently fell to 2.6%!3 The next Fed meeting is in September. If the economy really deteriorates, there could be an inter-meeting move lower for the Fed Funds Rate, but that’s highly unlikely. So, as things now stand, the Fed’s next rate reduction will likely occur in September. Stay tuned. Robert Barone, Ph.D. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: Trump’s tariffs could squeeze U.S. factories and raise costs by up to 4.5%, a new analysis finds

Stand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on! Josh Boak, Associated Press Josh Boak, Associated Press Paul Wiseman, Associated Press Paul Wiseman, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. READ MORE: Big 3 automakers say Trump’s tariff deal with Japan puts them at a disadvantage “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there’s the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. READ MORE: Trump is getting the world economy he wants — but the risk to growth could spoil his victory lap Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn’t say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,” said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices” under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,” Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,”’ he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.” Stand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on!

Title: Future Of Warner Bros. International TV Production Revealed
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/07/warner-bros-international-tv-production-future-revealed-1236472938/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T14:44:21Z
Full Content:
By Jesse Whittock, Max Goldbart EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday unveiled its post-split leadership plan, but absent from the detail was any mention of the Warner Bros International Television Production studio. Although WBD’s American studios and production divisions are being folded into David Zaslav’s new Warner Bros. business, we can reveal that the London-based WBITVP will, in fact, fall under the Discovery Global biz, which will be led by current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels. The separation is expected to close in mid-2026. We understand Warner Bros and Discovery are moving towards post-split agreements on Warner formats that WBITVP already sells on the international market. Watch on Deadline Several sources alerted Deadline to WBITVP’s post-split shift upon yesterday’s announcement, and a rep for WBD confirmed the decision. It may seem surprising that the international studio will now be separate from the likes of Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group and DC Studios, but insiders noted that the move is a logical one given that Discovery Global is international-facing. “One positive is it will have to be Euro-centric,” said one source in the continent. Furthermore, WBITVP already has a strong relationship with current WBD International President Gerhard Zeiler, who has become Discovery Global’s Chief Content Officer plus President in the U.S., UK and Germany. WBITVP President Ronald Goes is close with Zeiler, and the move allows the pair to continue working in lockstep, while continuing to work alongside Andy Zein, who is EVP Creative, Format Development and Sales. Sources said they expect more information on WBITVP’s post-split future in the coming days but downplayed the idea that there will be layoffs or mergers from within. One speculated that there may have been a tussle between Warner Bros. and Discovery Global over where WBITVP would sit. “It’s flattering that we aren’t just being shipped off, but it does seem right to be in this [Discovery Global] part of the business,” said the insider. WBITVP represents the rights to numerous Warner-created shows on the international market and makes the likes of The Bachelor, FBoy Island and Impractical Jokers via production hubs across Europe and in Australia and New Zealand. In the UK, it owns First Dates producer Twenty Twenty, Who Do You Think You Are? maker Wall to Wall and The Repair Shop indie Ricochet. Also among WBITVP’s catalog are 25 scripted formats, with several coming from the U.S., such as Gossip Girl, The O.C. and The Mentalist. WBITVP’s central team, which is primarily based in Old Street, London but also has staff in the U.S., has more than 50 employees on the books, according to its website. We understand WBITVP will be staying put at its current base, where it and CNN Worldwide, which is also moving to Discovery, are housed. Zeiler appeared a big winner out of yesterday’s post-split announcement. The WBD veteran has taken on the U.S. President role at Discovery Global, working closely with Wiedenfels at the top table on strategy. WBD LatAm and U.S. Hispanic boss Fernando Medin steps into his President of International shoes, and we understand his post will focus on territories elsewhere and finding new revenue streams for Discovery’s local businesses. The likes of U.S. Ad Sales President Ryan Gould, distribution boss Scott Miller and content strategy EVP Fulvia Nicoli will all report into Zeiler. Other notable international names moving to Discovery include Kasia Kieli, who has retained her role as President and MD, Poland and CEO of Polish network TVN. Following a period of intense speculation, the WBD split was revealed last month. The seismic move separates the company along similar lines to rival Comcast’s spinning out of its cable networks from NBCUniversal. Lionsgate’s split from Starz was confirmed in May. Broadly, the separation of studios and broadcast networks from cable business is seen by most leaders and analysts as part of future-proofing against an increasingly dominant set of digital-first rivals such as YouTube, Netflix and Amazon. Streaming’s rise and the continued decline of linear television have left investors confused and stock prices floundering, even with cable networks still posting very healthy profits. “By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape,” Zaslav said at the time. Warner Bros’ former parent, WarnerMedia, and Discovery first united under the latter’s long-serving chief, Zaslav, in April 2022. This formed the WBD business, which is now set to break apart again.

What a waste of potentially combining worldwide production operations to support a worldwide expanding SVOD service. I always thought WBITVP did not fit Warner Bros. and this is a good move How did you come to that conclusion? So a SVOD rolling out internationally only cares about US productions on the service and not making local versions for their international audiences? ridiculous. Fat cats ruining a legacy studio all over again. and keep chasing the streamers, you will never catch Youtube nor Netflix. never. They should be reinventing their business model not constantly copying someone elses, poorly. These legacy studios deserve to crumble into dust. We workers abhor the hand that feeds us.

Title: Tariffs are already raising prices — here’s what to buy before another round of hikes

Skin Care Hair Care Oral Care Health Fitness Sleep Kitchen Appliances & Tools Small Home Appliances Bedding & Bath Office Outdoor Electronics Headphones Smart Gadgets Computers Dogs Cats Pet Care Luggage Accessories Packing & Organization Follow Select Zoe Malin Reporter It’s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don’t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1. Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don’t be surprised if you’re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there’s still time to save — tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren’t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year. Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money. Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter. We don’t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn’t mean you should panic buy — it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you’ve been saving up for. It’s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty. A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren’t shooting up. But it’s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We’re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again. Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too. Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They’re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties. During a recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble’s CEO said shoppers will start seeing price hikes from its brands this summer, including Tide, which has manufacturing plants in the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide. Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines. Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor. Apple makes most of its hardware in China and produces devices like iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods in India and Vietnam. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who tested Apple’s AirPods 4 for two months, says they’re a small, comfortable pair you can rely on daily. “These are the best earbuds for anyone who hates the feeling of rubber eartips clogging their eardrums,” he says. “They also have new features like dust and water resistance, and adaptive audio, which automatically switches between noise cancellation modes.” The JBL Clip 5, which is made in China, is our team’s go-to Bluetooth speaker — the audio quality is impressive for the device’s size, and its built-in carabiner clip lets you attach it to bags, bikes, beach umbrellas, bathroom towel rods and more. You can use the speaker for up to 12 hours before needing to recharge it, according to the brand. The Clip 5 is also dust- and water-resistant. While Nintendo didn’t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.” The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it’s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon — its price could increase at any point, and it’s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It’s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games. Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it’s Google’s best smartwatch yet, although it’s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon). It has fitness tracking features, including the ability to automatically log workouts and build custom runs. The water-resistant watch has a 24-hour battery life, according to the brand, and collects data about your sleep. I buy basics from Gap every time they’re on sale, including this 100% cotton T-shirt, which is made in India. The shirt has a soft, loose feel, short sleeves and a crewneck. It runs true-to-size, in my experience. I typically wear it tucked into a pair of jeans, and in the colder months, I throw a cardigan over it. These Levi’s jeans, available in men’s and women’s sizes, are produced in China, but the brand makes and sources apparel from across the world. “I’ve been wearing a pair of Levi’s 501’s for over 6 years now,” says NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman. “I love the classic, straight fit because it works for almost every outfit, and the cut is honestly timeless. There’s a reason these are one of most iconic pairs of denim of all time.” Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer. According to an earnings call, the hikes were “modest” and “strategic.” The brand didn’t specify exactly what products increased in price, or whether customers should expect additional increases in the future. Lululemon’s Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings are my all-time favorite pair for high-intensity workouts like running, as well as strength training. They have two side pockets, a hidden pocket in the waistband and a waistband drawcord. Adidas, which primarily makes its shoes in Asia and Germany, will eventually raise prices on its U.S. products, according to the brand, which did not disclose how much increases will be or what items will be affected. These are some of Adidas’ most classic sneakers for men and women. The Samba has a leather upper, synthetic fabric lining and grippy rubber outsole. Birkenstock, which makes products at its factories in Germany, plans to raise prices globally to offset tariffs at some point before September. The brand’s Arizona slip-on sandal for men and women has two adjustable straps and a cork footbed. There’s also a deep heel cup to keep your foot secure, as well as a raised toe bar to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, according to the brand. During a recent earnings call, Under Armour, which sources products from countries like Vietnam, Jordan and Indonesia, shared that it’s increasing prices on its apparel, shoes and accessories. We’ve tested lots of Under Armour’s activewear and sneakers over the years. The Charged Surge 4, available in men’s and women’s sizes, is a basic shoe that’s great for walkers, runners and gym goers. It has a cushioned midsole to support feet and a grippy rubber outsole to stabilize you on various surfaces. The sneaker is also made with mesh to keep feet cool. SharkNinja already raised prices on a handful of products in response to tariffs, and will continue to, according to a statement from the company’s CEO during a recent earnings call. Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja’s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it’s big enough to feed a few people, yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand. We recommend Dyson’s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy — Dyson’s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool. In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We’re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven’t seen yet — that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand’s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions. Ikea’s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they’re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz’s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. “This storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City — it’s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,” he says. “It’s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.” Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas — that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper’s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. “I bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,” she says. “It’s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I’m really picky about my mattresses because I’m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn’t trap heat, in my experience.” The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you’re in the market for one of the brand’s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand’s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand’s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you’re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent. Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited “global economic factors and rising material costs” as the reason for the hike. Rabinowitz started buying the brand’s diapers when his baby was born last year. “Using Coterie’s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don’t have ingredients that I’m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,” says Rabinowitz. “The subscription is easy to use and very flexible — if I’m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.” Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn’t specify which ones — if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo’s compact travel stroller. “The Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,” she says. “It’s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it’s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.” Yes, in addition to individual brands, some retailers plan to start pricing their merchandise higher due to tariffs. Here are a few we know about right now: The companies below already raised prices due to tariffs, and they may do so again depending on how policies change over the next few weeks. I’ll continue updating this list as more companies announce hikes. Tariffs are causing many people to reevaluate their spending habits. In fact, 49% of U.S. consumers plan to buy less frequently if/when tariffs raise prices, according to Smarty. Here are a few expert tips from Porwal to help you save. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. If a company brings foreign goods into the U.S., it must pay the U.S. government a percentage of those goods. Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China and Mexico are also in ongoing talks with the U.S. about tariffs — China's pause on duties expires on Aug. 12 and Mexico's pause expires at the end of October. Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven’t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April — that won’t be the case forever though. “Companies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that’s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,” says Ales. “But eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they’ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.” Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. “The tariff needs to be absorbed by someone — is it the business or the consumer?,” says Steinman. “We don’t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.” “In terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it’s going to be almost universal,” says Steinman. “Right now, it seems like it’s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.” That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal. There’s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by. Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. “So far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There’s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they’re accepting the volatility around tariffs,” she says. “It’s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don’t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.” Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now. At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also ensure that all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and with no undisclosed financial conflicts of interest. I’m a reporter at NBC Select who has been covering tariffs since they were imposed earlier this year. To write this article, I interviewed four experts about what you should buy as brands raise prices due to tariffs, and rounded up a handful of related foreign-made goods the NBC Select staff recommends. I also put together a list of brands that have raised prices due to tariffs already.

Nvidia (NVDA) ordered 300,000 chipsets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), as the chipmaker prepares to resume sales in China amid strong demand in the country, a Reuters report said. The order is for Nvidia’s H20 chips, a less-powerful AI chip tailored to meet U.S. export restrictions. Sales of the H20 in China were effectively banned earlier this year when the Trump administration instituted licensing requirements, but President Donald Trump seemed to reverse course following a recent meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “The U.S. government has assured NVIDIA that licenses will be granted, and NVIDIA hopes to start deliveries soon,” the chipmaker said on July 14. Nvidia’s significant TSMC order adds to the company’s existing H20 stockpile of 600,000 to 700,000 chips, the report said. Sources familiar with the matter reportedly said strong Chinese demand for the chips led Nvidia to make the additional order. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment to Investopedia. TSMC did not immediately respond. Shares of Nvidia were little changed shortly after the opening bell Tuesday but have increased in value by nearly a third in 2025.

Title: Hubert Horan: Can Airlines Get Passengers to Accept AI-Driven Personalized/Surveillance Pricing?

Yves here. The individualized price gouging that Delta plans to implement seems to be coming soon. But as Hubert Horan explains, this case of “AI is coming to eat your lunch” does not look as easy to pull off as Delta might think. Even so, Congresscritters are already saddling up to head Delta off at the pass. The proposed bill below is in addition to objections raised by three Senators that Hubert mentions below. You shouldn’t be charged more or paid less because of your ZIP code or search history. I just introduced a bill to ban “surveillance pricing” — when corporations use your data to hike up prices or cut your wages. It’s invasive. It’s exploitative. And it needs to end. pic.twitter.com/4vOn6AFPF2 — Congressman Greg Casar (@RepCasar) July 27, 2025 The Economist just reported on another ruse that some US airlines tried implementing. It falls short of the individual pricing threat, but still got travelers’ dander up: In recent years airlines have grown ever more sophisticated in their pricing techniques. American carriers’ latest method of singling out business passengers, though, is strikingly simple—and has sparked outrage in the travel blogosphere. In May Thrifty Traveler, a website about travel bargains, reported that America’s three big legacy airlines—American, Delta and United—had started charging higher per-person fares for single-passenger bookings than for identical itineraries with two people. Kyle Potter, the author, grumbled that the practice amounted to carriers “weaponis[ing] their fares” against solo travellers who “can’t clone themselves”. Brian Kelly of The Points Guy, another travel site, called it “greed getting out of control” and said that airlines were “asking for government intervention”. Although no airline has yet commented on the subject, Delta and United reportedly scrapped the practice amid the criticism. To investigate further, The Economist turned to Serpapi, an automated interface to Google Flights, a fare database. For all direct domestic journeys on America’s three big legacy carriers, we downloaded one-way main-economy fares as of July 20th for one and two passengers to travel on Monday July 28th, choosing whichever flight had an airline’s cheapest single-passenger price for that route that day. We also pulled return fares—one the following Friday and the other on Saturday—for both one and two passengers. In total, we amassed 19,000 prices across 3,200 routes. Delta has indeed abandoned the technique: its two-passenger price is always at least twice the fare for one. But American and United have persisted. Solo flyers who travel with them within the work week can end up paying more than everyone else, including solo travellers whose journey involves a weekend stay and those who travel with others, regardless of whether their trip stretches into a weekend. In other words, airlines are exposed to consumer backlash, and even, as regulated entities, political pressure. So individualized pricing were to get traction, some airlines could tout their abstention. I could see Middle Eastern carriers, like Qatar Air and Emirates, which cater to a high end clientele, advertising that they don’t nickel and dime customers this way. By Hubert Horan, who has 40 years of experience in the management and regulation of transportation companies (primarily airlines) and has been publishing analysis of Uber since 2016 Delta’s President Glen Hauenstein told investors that it sees AI-driven personalized (or surveillance) pricing as “a full re-engineering of how we price, and how we will be pricing in the future”. He said “we’re really excited about partnering with Fetchrr” (Delta’s Israel-based AI consultant) whose tools were helping Delta “get inside the mind of our consumer” so that eventually, “we will have a price that’s available on that flight, on that time, to you, the individual.” He said that AI tools were now setting prices on 3% of Delta flights but he expected 20% of flights would be AI priced by the end of 2025.[1] The definition of personalized/surveillance pricing is well understood and represents a radical departure from other forms of algorithmic pricing. [2] Algorithmic pricing simply means that many of the rules (algorithms) governing when prices should be adjusted in response to new information about consumer demand or competitor actions have been automated. Airlines pioneered pricing automation in the 1980s, which incorporated second degree price discrimination, so different fares can be offered on flights with higher or lower demand, and different fares can be offered with different conditions (advance purchase requirements, different checked baggage or seat assignment surcharges). But under second degree price discrimination every consumer sees the exact same price offering at any given time. Every consumer has the identical opportunity to pay less if they buy in advance and can only sit in the very back of the plane or pay more at the last minute and sit closer to the front. Delta is reengineering its pricing around using first degree price discrimination. Personalized/surveillance data is used to estimate the maximum price each individual would be willing to pay. Individuals would no longer see the same prices that all others are seeing. Any claims that first degree price discrimination would improve overall efficiency or benefit consumers are false. The original use of second degree price discrimination in the 80s did improve efficiency and consumer welfare. Price sensitive customers who were willing to buy tickets on lower demand in advance got much lower fares than previously available, and more time-sensitive customers willing to pay more got greater access to higher demand flights at the last minute. Airlines achieved much higher capacity utilization (load factors), earned much more revenue on flights that had previously been half empty, and avoided the huge expense of adding aircraft that were only needed at peak periods. But the efficiency gains from price discrimination were exhausted long ago. Increased price discrimination would only be a wealth transfer from consumers to airline shareholders. To use simplistic Economics 101 terminology, when everyone sees a standard market price, a consumer surplus is created because some consumers would have been willing to pay more. First degree price discrimination using personalized/surveillance pricing attempts to eliminate as much of that consumer surplus as possible by charging each customer the most they would be willing to pay. Passengers pay more without getting anything of value in return. Lots of companies have tried to introduce personalized/surveillance pricing but corporate announcements including Delta’s usually generate consumer backlash. Three Democratic Senators complained that this could support predatory pricing and demanded that Delta disclose what information about individual consumers it would be using to set prices. [3] Airline passengers understand that airlines don’t have their best interests in mind, can quickly see through attempts to claim first degree price discrimination is the same thing as traditional second-degree discrimination and readily dismiss ludicrous attempts to claim personalized/surveillance pricing will actually lead to lower prices. [4] The shift from second degree to AI-driven first-degree price discrimination would be one of the biggest aviation changes in decades. So I went to the Fetcherr website and found surprisingly that it said that its airline AI offerings don’t actually do any of the things Hauenstein was claiming. [5] They don’t collect data about individual customers or analyze the price elasticities or other characteristics of individual customers or fine-tuned customer segments. Fletchrr emphasizes that its AI/data tools are designed to be easily integrated into existing pricing practices and there is absolutely no suggestion they were designed to help an airline to completely reengineer its pricing function. Something is seriously wrong here, but what? Are Delta and/or Fletchrr being less than honest about what they are doing? Major investments in AI tools are only appropriate in cases where a company needs to process massively greater amounts of external data than before and wants to divine correlations that human analysts using PC based software could never find. Large Language Models identify text patterns that can help automate preparation of article summaries and documents. Activity specific models find correlations between millions of historical inputs and outputs that can support the automation of basic tasks like coding or accounting. Two major AI applications are especially relevant here. The primary “get inside the mind of the consumer” case is advertising, where large companies like Google and Facebook used their access to massive amounts of data about individual users to program real-time ads more effectively than traditional human marketing analysts. The primary “use Big Data to totally re-engineer previously human+PC software analytical functions” came in the 1990s when hedge funds used hitherto unprecedented amounts of computing power to find factors correlated with asset price changes that drove more higher average returns and incorporate them into high-speed computerized trading strategies. [6] One possible explanation for these apparent contradictions is that Fletchrr doesn’t understand airline pricing very well. Its founders come from the hedge fund world where AI tools are critical because there are millions of traders, billions of transactions, individual markets are highly volatile, can be influenced by an unpredictable range of external factors, and major traders are constantly changing their strategies. Fletchrr never explains why this experience would apply to airlines where supply and demand are highly stable in the short/medium term, the number of airline competitors is limited and while their pricing approaches can evolve over time they haven’t changed dramatically or unexpectedly in decades. Why did Fletchrr see airlines as a prime target for its AI sales efforts? Because they thought airlines were “outdated” “undisrupted” and had seen few recent technological advances. In fact, airlines were perhaps the non-military industry quickest to drive innovation in operations research, IT technology, and modern pricing/distribution tools, and of course saw business models totally transformed in the last quarter of the 20th Century. They may not seem highly dynamic to someone whose experience is limited to the recent development of hedge fund quant models, but very few industries anywhere experience that rate of technological change. Fletchrr says airlines need AI tools to handle today’s faster rate of change, but the only examples of hard to handle change it offered were nonsensical–the impact of Covid on demand and the challenge of previously unscheduled flights into Doha for the FIFA World Cup. Fletchrr doesn’t provide any concrete examples of major problems it can solve that current pricing systems can’t deal with. The input data for Fletchrr’s AI market model is the exact same input data airline revenue management systems have been using for decades. There might be value in a tool that can quickly process greater volumes of input data; every corporate function could be improved at the margin, and perhaps these gains would justify the IT investment. But these would be marginal improvements, would not represent the complete reengineering of pricing that Delta claimed, or anything that could produce the major revenue/profit impacts that would justify major announcements to investors. Another possible explanation is that Delta executives never thought through the requirements, potential gains and implementation risks of re-engineering its existing systems into personalized/surveillancepricing. Perhaps Delta never bothered to figure out that Fletchrr’s software was only offering marginally greater automation of traditional pricing tasks and never considered that Fletchrr’s software wasn’t designed to drive the dramatic changes it thought its investors would value. Delta hasn’t made any attempt to define the shortcomings in its existing pricing systems that it is hoping to address or explain how a future reengineered system would differ from today’s. Maybe Delta executives had drunk the Kool-aid of the AI hype machine, assumed anything labelled “AI” would have magical, powerful impacts anywhere and never stopped to consider whether the conditions that allowed AI tools to create value in other industries applied here. Perhaps Delta executives more cynically thought that splashy announcements of big AI projects would juice the stock price, would reinforce Delta’s image of having more progressive management than United or Delta, and assumed that investors would never hold management accountable if there wasn’t a big revenue/profit boost. Even if it is I possible that Fletchrr’s hedge fund trained AI experts overestimated the applicability of its tools to airlines and that Delta management accepted too much AI hype it seems rather improbable that both these two sophisticated companies would announce a major effort where the goals were badly misaligned. One more plausible explanation is that Fletchrr fully understands that Delta is determined to achieve first degree price discrimination, and both parties wanted to obscure this. It could be that Fletchrr knew its AI-driven Market Model was well suited for personalized/surveillance pricing but deliberately excluded any mention of this from its promotional material to help shield airline clients from external criticism in cases like this. Fletchrr’s website gives Delta a way to plausibly deny outside critics (“that’s not what these AI tools do!”) without having to formally disavow their pursuit of personalized/surveillance pricing. It could be that Fletchrr’s models were never designed to process huge volumes of personal information but Delta believe they can be adopted to support first degree price discrimination. It remains possible that Delta’s effort to use AI-driven personalized/surveillance pricing will fail to materially boost profitability. The articles reporting Hauenstein’s claim mentioned a range of potential obstacles to personalized/surveillance pricing including the ready availability of data on market (non-personalized) prices that would allow flyers to see if Delta was trying to get them to pay above-market fares. While it is widely understood how Google and Facebook can use terabytes of personal data to tailor ad displays, no one has publicly explained how personal data would allow an airline to calculate price elasticities for each customer and reliably predict that this individual shopping for this specific flight would be willing to pay more than it was asking other customers to pay. It is not even clear that the price elasticities of individual customers can be measured, or that a system could identify how an individual’s elasticity varied from trip to trip (e.g. critical last minute sales meeting, attending a conference that may or may not have value, taking the kids to visit grandma). Many observers assume that first degree price discrimination would require forcing most passengers to not only grant Delta access to much more personal information than they have now, but to force them use Delta-controlled sales channels. A recent American attempt to force corporate agents serving higher yielding passengers to use a captive channel actually reduced revenue by over a billion dollars and was withdrawn. [7] Delta’s best customers might similarly resist any attempt to force them to use a channel that prevented them from seeing what true market rates were. Uber provides a case example of a company where shifting to first degree price discrimination did produce a very large profit boost. Uber previously offered the same fare to any customer and offered the same payment to any driver (based on factors such as distance and time of day) with a system that estimated the highest fare/lowest payments they would accept.[8] But if Delta was attracted to personalized/surveillance pricing by the big profit boost Uber achieved it may be badly disappointed because Delta has none of the structural advantages that allow Uber to maximize exploitive discrimination. Uber rides are last minute purchases and riders have no ability to compare prices. There are no independent Google/Kayak/Expedia-type sources of true market taxi pricing information. Delta frequent flyers understand airline pricing and would quickly figure out if changes were unfavorable. Uber users have no real idea how Uber pricing works, and Uber (and Lyft) have achieved quasi-monopoly pricing power after using billions in predatory subsidies to drive independent competition out of the market. It should be emphasized that the central issue, should Delta have any success pursuing first degree price discrimination is not “AI technology” or “pricing algorithms” but the ability to exploit anti-competitive market power. Simplistic Economics 101 models say producers can’t achieve the capture of consumer surplus that Delta hopes to achieve using first degree price discrimination because consumers would be protected by market competition and the availability of perfect information about market prices. First degree price competition works for Uber because they tightly control all marketplace information, have eliminated all meaningful competition and any ability of elected officials to enforce consumer and labor law protections. Even Uber investors have no ability to see how pricing and driver compensation changes affect profitability. Thus any attempt to implement first degree price discrimination requires subverting the proper workings of competitive markets. Without significant artificial market power Delta would have no ability to force its best customers to use Delta controlled distribution channels, or to limit their ability to see if Delta is only showing them fares higher than other customers can get. Without significant artificial market power Delta would have no ability to blow off customer backlash, negative publicity and complaints from Congress. The ability to impose first degree price discrimination should perhaps be seen as prima facie evidence that a company has artificial anti-competitive market power. While normal companies that achieved a multi-billion profit recovery would aggressively publicize the brilliance of its management moves, Uber management has gone to great lengths to keep the public from becoming aware that it made a major shift to first order price discrimination and that that shift was the major reason Uber finally became profitable. Uber understands that a greater awareness of passenger/driver exploitation could not only drive serious customer/political backlash but create awareness that its profitability had nothing to do with management brilliance but was driven entirely by the subversion of market competition. Delta might rationally believe that it already has the artificial market power to pursue personalized/surveillance pricing while ignoring the objections of its best customers but Uber management might warn them to take these risks more seriously. American’s CEO has already called Delta’s proposed pricing shift a “bait and switch” plan.

I could very easily see this happening. I travel a lot on Delta, and I believe I have been targeted in this way in recent months. The increase in business class fare offerings has been amazing and I believe that once you’ve shown a willingness to pay $2k for a cross-country seat or $10k for an overseas flight, for a business trip where your dates are not flexible [and you’re being reimbursed], that’s what they’re going to show you for all travel from now on. But I don’t believe they can fill the cabin that way. Many users are sucked into the loyalty program or (like me) limited to certain airlines based on a smaller home airport, but if they’re going to price gouge, and other airlines refrain, I’m going elsewhere. Hopefully the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can save me . . . oh, wait. But if you really think about it, they are mostly targeting the PMC here, so maybe there will be some legislative pushback after all. I don’t know if it’s the result of AI, but something changed with Delta’s domestic pricing recently. I fly the same route regularly, and within the past few weeks the price of the particular ticket I usually buy increased substantially in comparison to other options. The result is (1) for the first time in quite a while I checked Expedia to see what my other options are, and (2) I will buy the cheapest ticket instead of the one I usually buy. I also noticed on my last few flights that the relative number of people boarding in the last (cheapest ticket) group has increased substantially, and the flights are not as full. Maybe that benefits Delta somehow, but I don’t really understand how. Unclear whether what you saw is related to the recently announced software program, which is still in early testing. But it could have been the result of a previous cruder non-AI algorithm Delta was using. As I mentioned it is well understood that frequent travelers fly for a wide variety of reasons over time with widely divergent price elasticities and no one has ever explained how any “personalized” system could afjust prices for each different situation My recommendation to anyone who thinks they have been a victim of first degree price discrimination is to quickly look up fares on an internet travel agency (Kayak, Expedia, etc) or signin to Delta with the ID of a spouse/friend who doesn’t have a similar usage of full-fare/premium tickets. Take screen shots. If its clear you’ve been offered a higher-than-market fare, complain to Delta with a “why are you trying to gouge me?” email After I wrote the comment I had my wife look up the same itinerary on her phone. The particular ticket I usually buy was significantly less than was offered to me, while the other fares were the same. I went back to double check and I was still being offered the higher rate. They will now have some solid information about my elasticity. The airlines are presumably not the only ones who can play this high tech arbitrage game, and they could wind up hoisted on their own petards. What is to stop some enterprising young nerdbox from developing a bot with the profile that would cause it to be offered the lowest price, and then buy up all the tickets for a given flight and sell them on the secondary market? If it can be done with tickets to concerts and sporting events, why not plane tickets too? When you buy a plane ticket you have to enter your passport or some form of ID. The ticket is not transferable. At least this is my experience. Nice thought though! Turning the tides on them and all Huh? Not in the US or when I buy international tix to Southeast Asia. I provide the passport # only at check in time. Expat2uruguay, I haven’t traveled much since 9-11, so my memory of buying tickets for travel and procedures at the airport when one is checking in is quite rusty. I did a cursory search on transferability of tickets and found that most airlines don’t allow it, and the few that do generally charge fees to do a name change. Sometimes the fee itself can be so expensive that it makes more sense to purchase a new ticket for the person who will actually be flying. Regardless, the person showing up for the flight has to produce an acceptable-to-TSA I.D. which matches the name on the ticket. That alone would preclude the idea that lyman alpha blob proposed. Hope this helps. I booked a flight to the UK for October and have to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization, which I did not have to do when I flew there last year. https://www.gov.uk/eta They want photos of my passport and of my face. Not surprised. Last time I renewed my UK passport they demanded to see my other passports. Rather than send sensitive data electronically (which I don’t think is their business anyway) I paid to travel by train to their UK hub office and simply showed them my Aussie passport making sure they couldn’t take pics of complete info. Yes. The EU is doing the same thing; they were trying to roll it out for this summer but they couldn’t get it done in time. Next year you’ll need another EVisa for the EU countries. While maybe the AI will make it worse but fare manipulation has been know about for years if not decades. What day of the week you look or buy, did you look recently, and location etc all of which means you’re presented with higher prices. I know I’ve seen this happen to me before. And definitely not for biz/first class. > It is not even clear that the price elasticities of individual customers can be measured, or that a system could identify how an individual’s elasticity varied from trip to trip (e.g. critical last minute sales meeting, attending a conference that may or may not have value, taking the kids to visit grandma). Patently false. My former mentor (Louviere) made his name originally by doing PRECISELY this for Qantas in the early 1980s using (what were at that point pretty primitive) discrete choice experiments (DCEs) and often used the very bad “conjoint analysis” techniques which he later freely disavowed calling most of his early 1980s research “crap and not worth reading”. But DCEs have been used to map demand functions for years, and these days with the rise of the web and online panels, map them under all those different types of contexts mentioned. The most successful applications are not ones you’ll find referenced….I’ve mentioned before the one that flew under even our radar (macquarie bank’s use of them which I discovered by accident). It’s such cases that should really worry people. My point that individual elasticities cannot be measured was in the context of an airline booking system that has to deal with millions and millions of booking/fare inquiries and needs to decide instantaneously what to show to each specific individual. My dubiousness reflects some familiarity with attempts in the past (perhaps including the QF example you cited) that were totally useless plus some other issues. What I’d seen in the past wasn’t based on individuals but on market segment categories, e.g. investment bankers, salespeople, government employees, people who attended a given trade fair every year) with the aggregate elasticity estimate applied to anyone placed in that category. Also useless in real world airline pricing. But if you have any studies that purport to estimate individual elasticities in a large scale operational setting that you think might be somewhat legitimate, please let me know Thanks for engaging. I’ll clarify as much as I can. As you might have guessed, a load of Louviere’s work with Qantas was not published as it was commercially sensitive. The stuff that WAS published (like the “conjoint” stuff using rating scales) was garbage (as subsequently said by the man himself). Thus if you want a good well known empirical example there is one which won the “Nobel” in Economics: Dan McFadden’s construction of the demand curve for the (not even yet built) BART in SF Bay Area, based on a synthesis of revealed preference data (what choices people ACTUALLY made in real life) PLUS stated preference data (what they’d do when given hypothetical but realistic scenarios). McFadden’s results were proven correct once BART was built. It is the ultimate example of how we can map out the demand function pretty easily, if you put in the work. Online panels make it trivially easy. My worry here was the siloisation of academia: nobody looking into other fields to see if something had been solved there. DCEs are sometimes criticised because the respondents aren’t sufficiently familiar with the options on offer. Most passengers on flights know exactly what everything entails and I designed surveys to give real time results on people’s trade-offs. The “what to show an individual” is trivial and I have zero doubt that big airlines have been using DCE data to do this for YEARS. We’ve gone WAY beyond the market segment objection you made. I can model individuals. I don’t need to use ANY inter-individual data or inferences. I describe this in my book. We were doing this over 10 years ago with no AI. PS AI is actually not the “big bad wolf” here. By its very nature it scrapes existing data (flight characteristics) already out there. In other words, it uses data from what traditional economists would recognise as the production possibility frontier and the points that actually got “activated” by intersections with the demand curve. Points that are currently not implemented (think of the iPhone just before its launch) cannot be modeled using AI data. People don’t yet know enough about the product characteristics and if you scrape existing data on characteristics of existing phones (think those stylus Windows phones up to 2009ish) then you’ll get horridly confounded estimates. The “artificial but realistic” data from a DCE is essential (and I stress again, following proper education of the respondents about what it could potentially do) in estimating demand surfaces (since we’re in multi dimensional space). The issue of price discrimination should’ve been addressed 15 years ago when my old industry learnt how to do it brilliantly and way before AI. Indeed AI should be criticised for loads of reasons but this is not a valid one. We shot ourselves in the foot years ago. I think they will because people really want to travel and have proven themselves to put up with any kind of humiliation from airlines and ”security checks”. Somewhat related, airlines make their money on their loyalty programs and credit cards. The high transaction fees make this work. Using points for tickets has become more challenging as airlines mostly use dynamic pricing for award tickets. Some now require login to display award pricing, so surveillance pricing is likely active for some. Data: US Airlines Operate As Loss Leaders For Their Loyalty Programs OMAAT Delta had a 10.5% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -2.5% margin United had an 8.9% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -1.9% margin American had a 4.8% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -8.3% margin Alaska had a 4.9% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -11.4% margin Southwest had a 1.2% operating margin, but without loyalty revenue, would’ve had a -19.9% margin The US carriers are all terrible now. They should take lessons from the big Asian or the ME3 airlines. I’m so old I remember fares printed in ink in schedules. And economy was a pleasant experience. Thank you Jimmy Carter for neoliberal crapification! Generally I agree but Ryanair was different. I don’t actually think it deserves the bad rap it gets. Not ACROSS THE BOARD anyway. I used it quite a bit 2009-2015 when I was living down under but attending Euro conferences (with trips to family tagged on). On the “non-bucket-holiday routes” I never had problems. You got what you paid for and expected. It was only the routes (often UK to certain popular holiday destinations) frequented by drunken idiots from my own home country of UK that made the flight awful. Ryanair has, IIRC remained profitable or at least not get hit anything like as bad as other carriers even in bad years like 2020. Of course I do wonder if an increasing amount of their profit comes from the abominable scratch cards etc they push on you….. It has been six years since I last flew commercial. Don’t miss it at all! The last airfare I paid was for vacation with son’s family, Granpa needed to be with Grandkids. Otherwise, too much business travel makes me rather drive 30 hours Thanks for this post. Thank Hubert! Whether prices are set by humans or AI, consumers will only purchase tickets if they consider the price to be reasonable. Regarding Uber and Lyft some anecdotal experience. I have found checking prices between them that Lyft is usually cheaper and when speaking to the drivers they get a higher percentage of the fare. In a recent situation my daughter used Uber and at the end of her ride the driver asked her what the fare was (as the driver couldn’t see it) and offered a $10 discount for a direct payment which my daughter did and the driver canceled the ride which resulted in no charge through the app. In major city airports there are taxi stands that often are significantly cheaper than using uber and readily available. I expect these work arounds will expand in time. In addition Waymo etc… is much cheaper and will also start cutting into Uber and Lyft’s profits. (No pesky driver to pay). As far as surveillance pricing for airlines and grocery stores I expect a great deal of on the ground resistance. Just as a reference point on AI… this is NOT intelligence or even ARTIFICIAL intelligence. As I and others keep pointing out this is not “intelligence” as people general think. This is just MASSIVE computing power. Companies have been doing this type of pricing, marketing and targeting for years! However, connecting a customer and his personal data (customer provided at the POS and ACQUIRED from other 3rd party sources) and computing a pricing target at the POS has only been a dream until recently. This is not “intelligence” this is massive computing power of data in a real-time fashion against a developed statistical model. Yes, the outputs may make senses for maximizing profits, but the pricing points do not come from any computer intelligence as we would recognize. That said, it doesn’t mean we’re screwed, but the elite have always been dreaming of that, how else are they to pay for their lifestyle. Maybe Delta executives had drunk the Kool-aid of the AI hype machine, assumed anything labelled “AI” would have magical, powerful impacts anywhere… Almost certainly this is the explanation. Horan, bless his heart, assumes that decisions about AI are made on the basis of hard-headed technical analyses. What we have been seeing in fact is that companies are adopting AI strictly out of a fear of missing out or being last to the party regarding the technology they don’t understand. This process is accelerated by the two or three companies that are pushing AI for all its worth. Fetchrr is clearly looking for ways to sell its snake oil to large businesses before the whole AI bubble collapses. Well, one advantage of government travel was GSA had contracted rates for just about anywhere you would need to go. Sometimes you could finesse this — flying from Oxnard CA to DC the contract was with United, but an option was a one-way car rental to LAX and American had the LAX-DCA contract. Way back when I was stationed in Crystal City in VA (how the Navy got kicked out of Main Navy on Constitution Ave and ended up in leased space in Arlington is a question for another day) I was a member of a locker room facility we used for jogging at lunch. There were some guys from US Air who were usually there (at the time they had some sort of offices at National) and they would always be discussing among themselves how airline X had changed its pricing on a certain route and how US Air should react. I guess from the days before software took it all over. Back then Piedmont had a monopoly on DC to Norfolk or Newport News flights, and it was always a question if it was better to drive it than fly. Google flights has served me well as it tracks price fluctuations anonymously. Price wars are quite evident there. I buy separate one-way tickets to fly round-trip US coast-to-coast every few months domestically. My “status” usually gets me front-economy seats on AA with some leg room and one free checked bag. Good enough even with AA’s ongoing deterioration to not bother with competition. Thankfully I no longer must fly to SA and Oz occasionally for work, and I can plan domestic trips several months in advance. it’s long been rumoured (long before “a/i” was a thing) that surfing with a mac usually results in higher prices than with a windows or linux machine. with my main browser, i used to spoof my user agent string. never proved a thing. cuz the user agent isn’t the only data used? who knows? Do Insurance next. Can of worms, I imagine. It’s always a good day when Hubert Horan has a new post. I just started reading the Vox article on this when I wandered to NC and here we are. I’ve read that some grocery stores are beginning to move this way. Unless they are immunized from civil rights laws, I can see many lawsuits for racial discrimination. It would be very easy to get a test group of people ‘of color’ with poor credit scores versus a control group of wealthy whites. Perversely, the algorithms will offer lower prices to the wealthier consumer with better credit. I’ve already wondered about Amazon’s exposure to this as I am sure they tailor their prices to the data they have on your purchasing history. Anyway, cheers to Hubert.

Title: Trump voter and Montana Knife Co. founder feels tariff pain: His $515,000 sharpener from Germany is set to cost another $77,250

As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there’s the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn’t say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’” he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people.

Download your cheat sheet and checklist to start building content that works harder. Your Competitors Have Already Started. You’ll learn why traditional SEO tactics still matter, how query fanout shapes which documents are selected, and what makes content truly quotable. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Your Competitors Have Already Started. Exclusive interview about the publisher lawsuit, exclusive data on the confidence of AI trackers, AI Overviews, AI Mode, and how to upskill. It’s halftime. The first half of 2025 brought major shakeups in SEO, AI, and organic growth – and it’s time for a reality check. Traffic is down, revenue is … complicated, and large language models (LLMs) are no longer fringe. Publishers are panicking, and SEO teams are reevaluating how they measure success. And it’s not just the tech shifting; it’s the economy around it. The DOJ’s antitrust case against Google could reshape the playing field before Q4 even begins. In today’s Memo, I’m unpacking the state of organic growth at the midpoint of 2025: Plus, premium subscribers will receive my scorecard that will help evaluate whether the team is adapting effectively to the AI landscape. Let’s take stock of where we are, and what comes next. Boost your skills with Growth Memo’s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free! AI Overviews (AIOs) looked “interesting” to marketers in 2024 and “devastating” in 2025. The traffic loss impact ranges from 15% to 45% declines, from my own observations. Bottom-line metrics across the industry range from “traffic down, revenue up” to “traffic down, revenue down.” In February, I wrote in The Impact of AI Overviews that mostly the top of the funnel (TOFU) queries were impacted: Every study I looked at confirmed that the majority of AI Overviews show up for informational-intent keywords like questions. Shortly after, in March 2025, Google nullified that theory by dialing up the number of AIOs way beyond the top of the funnel. Ever since, U.S. companies have experienced a strong (negative) impact, and I’m hearing the phrase “SEO is dead” more often from leaders. Between 13 and 19% of keywords show AI Overviews, according to Semrush and seoClarity, but I assume the actual number is much higher because searchers use much longer prompts. (Prompts that most tools don’t track.) [1, 2] I expect organic traffic to keep dropping as the year moves forward. In theAIO Usability study I published in May, only a small fraction of clicks still came through to websites. It wouldn’t surprise me if 70% of the organic traffic that sites earned in 2024 is gone by 2026, leaving just 30% of that organic traffic behind. Scary? Yes. But traffic is just a means. The same study also shows that 80% of searchers still lean on organic results to complete their search journeys. So, I still feel optimistic about the value of organic search in the long term. There are two questions top of mind for me at the moment: In my view, either: With one exception. The whole internet is trying to figure out whether the value of showing up in LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, AI Mode, AI Overviews, etc.) is worth more than the loss in traffic. But without a doubt, publishers and affiliates are the group that gets hit the hardest due to their reliance on ad impressions and link clicks. No one needs traffic as much as publishers. The consequence? Leading publishers and news sites will conduct layoffs and assume that Google traffic will go to zero at some point. At a companywide meeting earlier this year, Nicholas Thompson, chief executive of the Atlantic, said the publication should assume traffic from Google would drop toward zero and the company needed to evolve its business model. [3] Publishers in the EU have banded together and filed an antitrust complaint against Google for its launch and the impact of AI Overviews with the European Commission. [4] Publishers using Google Search do not have the option to opt out from their material being ingested for Google’s AI large language model training and/or from being crawled for summaries, without losing their ability to appear in Google’s general search results page. I caught up with Chris Dicker, who leads one of the co-signatories in the DMA complaint against Google, the Independent Publishers Alliance: Kevin: What’s your role in the lawsuit against Google? Chris: The Independent Publishers Alliance is one of the co-signatories on the complaint. I am helping lead this from the Alliance side. Kevin: What would be an outcome, i.e., an action by Google, that would be satisfactory? Chris: We are only asking for what we deem to be fair, which is for a sustainable ecosystem. Whether that is payment for use of content or for Google to start to substantially reduce the zero-click searches, which have gotten significantly worse since the launch of AIOs. Kevin: Can LLMs (ChatGPT & Co) provide some remedy against the traffic drop from Google? Chris: Not for publishers at the moment, no. They don’t have scale or the want to send traffic anywhere else. The current CTR’s we are seeing and that are being reported from publishers are tiny. OpenAI’s scrape to human visit is 179:1, compared with Perplexity’s 369:1 and Anthropic’s 8692:1 (stats from Tollbit’s State of bots Q1 2025). For perspective, Bing’s is 11:1. I know there are reports that the traffic from LLMs is “better quality,” but not on the metrics that would help publishers or content creators. It is very much the opposite: Bounce rate is higher; pages per session and per visit are also both considerably down for AI search traffic compared to organic search. Kevin: What are the consequences of Google’s AI Overviews on independent publishers so far? Can you quantify the impact? Chris: It’s significant and something that has been extrapolated even since April this year. There are sites that are seeing traffic drops of up to 70% since April. Publishers have no choice but to cut costs and, unfortunately, that also means job losses. In the last year, we have had numerous members who, unfortunately, haven’t been able to weather the storm and have ceased publishing altogether, and these are respected sites that were well established over the last 10 years, if not longer. Kevin: Do you know of publishers that are able to dampen the negative impact from AI Overviews in some ways? If so, what are they doing? Chris: Nearly every publisher I speak to is actively diversifying away from Google. It feels inevitable that we’ll see a mass blocking of Googlebot at some point, something that would have been inconceivable just 12 months ago. If your business model still relies on search traffic, whether from traditional search or AI-powered results, it’s time to rethink – and fast. More publishers are now focusing on direct audience relationships through newsletters, forums, podcasts, and similar channels. Platforms like Substack offer an interesting model, though I’m not convinced their approach fully suits publishers just yet. Beyond monetizing websites and content, many publishers are also developing in-house creative, social, or AI agencies. After all, these businesses have spent years engaging and inspiring audiences. Helping advertisers tap into that expertise feels like a natural next step. Besides the fact that the open web and critical societal instances are fading away, from a purely practical standpoint, there are also fewer publishers to amplify content for other businesses. And yet, I believe we haven’t seen the full extent to which Google Search will change from sending traffic to answering questions directly. At a recent event I attended, a Google representative mentioned that Sundar Pichai sees AI Mode as the default search experience in the next two to three years, with searchers being able to switch to classic search results if they want to – assuming users like AI Mode. And that seems to be the case: According to a (small) survey done by Oppenheimer & Co., 82% of searchers find AI Mode more helpful than Google Search, while 75% find it more helpful than ChatGPT (I wonder why). [5] Nothing shows fear more than copying a challenger’s user interface and abandoning the cash machine that worked for 20 years. AI Mode is basically ChatGPT with a Google logo. Google follows the Meta playbook, which fenced in Snapchat’s and TikTok’s growth by copying their core features. And most alarmingly for search marketers, AI Mode eats clicks for breakfast. Research by iPullrank found that “4.5% of AI Mode Sessions result in a click.”[6] A click. As in one! But Google cannot afford to lose the investor narrative. I personally believe that AI Mode won’t launch before Google has figured out the monetization model. And I predict that searchers will see way fewer ads but much better ones, and displayed at a better time. Due to the conversational interface and longer prompts, Google should not only have more context about what users really want, but they would also be able to better estimate when is the best time to show an ad during the chat conversation. As a result, I expect CPCs will skyrocket, but CPAs will become more efficient. Between AI Mode, AI Overviews, and ChatGPT stands this important question: How much can we influence answers, and how different is that job from what we’ve done in SEO over the last two decades? It’s simple. The tactics are mostly the same, but the ecosystem changes: 1. Longer prompts: The average prompt is 23 words long compared to 4.2 for classic Google Search. [7] The rich detail users provide about their intent hits a content gap that’s tuned for shorthead keywords on the other side of the marketplace. As a result, I see hyper-specialized content that’s fine-tuned for specific personas (see How to Optimize for Topics) in our present and future. 2. SEO winners are not AI winners: If SEO was enough and there was nothing else we needed to do “for AI,” then why aren’t the sites that are most visible in Search the same ones that are visible in LLMs? In Is GEO/AEO the same as SEO?, I found that the lists differ greatly in most verticals. Only highly consolidated spaces with a few winners, like CRM software, have identical winners across both modalities. 3. New intent: Generative: Semrush and Profound came to the conclusion that ~30-70% of intent on LLMs is “generative,” meaning users want to accomplish tasks right then and there. [8] What’s often missed is that while performing an action, e.g., generating an image, the intent can quickly flip to informational or transactional, e.g., learn more about the topic you want to generate the image about or buy icon license. Since experiences are conversational and more continuous, we need to update our model of intent. It doesn’t happen in isolation (think: one session), but several intents can occur during the same session (informational → generative → transactional → informational → etc.). My opinion: It’s too soon to coin a term. Will we switch from Answer Engine Optimization to Agentic Engine Optimization when we enter the Agentic AI age? AI has evolved at a rocket pace over the last 2.5 years, and I don’t expect it will slow down soon. In 2025, LLMs reached the mainstream. We’re not talking about a fringe platform anymore: ChatGPT supposedly receives 2.5 billion prompts a day. With Google seeing over 5 trillion searches per year, you could say ChatGPT has reached about 17.8% of Google’s volume. Keep in mind that a lot of prompts are not searches on ChatGPT, and then the comparison becomes weaker (until Google rolls AI Mode out broadly). [9] Important to note is that LLMs rely on different citation sources to varying degrees. [10] Profound saw in 30 million citations that ChatGPT, AIOs, and Perplexity rely on different citation sources: We know that investing time and resources into non-Google platforms is critical to building trust and visibility across all platforms. But now we know that the mix of platform investment depends on where you want to build visibility. Reddit seems to provide universal impact, which makes sense given their licensing deals with OpenAI and Google, but YouTube, Quora, and review platforms don’t show the same potential for gaining citations on all LLMs. Time also matters. AirOps found that 95% of pages cited in ChatGPT are less than 10 months old. [11] A big reason for this is the training data cutoff for LLMs. New models are still trained on large corpi of data (remember the Google Dance?). Anything newer than the time of training needs to come from the web. As a result, keeping content fresh and continuously iterating seems like a path to AI visibility to me. Even adding the current year to the URL (and meta-title) seems like a good idea. [12] A study by Apple, which I covered in the Growth Intelligence Brief, raises a question we might all have at the tip of our tongue: Are LLMs overhyped? [13] The answer: It depends … on the complexity of the task: LLMs are smart but still struggle with complex tasks. Good news for tech workers … right? And here’s another thing: With the increase of LLM use and adoption, how will we measure success for our optimization efforts? I ran a survey of Growth Memo in June, and it’s clear our industry hasn’t really nailed how we measure the LLM visibility of our brands. Out of those who responded, about 30% are using traditional SEO tools to measure LLM visibility, 26% are using Google Analytics 4 traffic signals, and a whopping 21% aren’t measuring yet and need help determining how. And the biggest surprise is this: Overwhelmingly, we don’t trust our LLM visibility measurements. Close to 80% of survey respondents don’t believe the way they are measuring LLM visibility is accurate. A big topic in the whole LLM conversation is, of course, whether AI replaces white collar workers or not. I’m including this discussion in my halftime report because I’m seeing a growing number of in-house experts who are afraid to be replaced. Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, wrote a public memo, saying the company would need fewer people because of AI (bolded text is mine): “As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” [14] Amazon has cut +27,000 jobs between 2022 and 2023, but has never had more employees at the end of 2024, except for at the end of 2021 by a small margin. [15] Other tech companies pulled even: But is AI really replacing white collar workers, or is it used for good PR? Layoff tracker, layoffs.fyi, shows that the number of companies and employees laid off is not growing since the pandemic. A jobs report by CompTIA shows that while tech employment is slightly down between June 2023 and June 2025…[18] …the number of job openings with AI skills far outpaces the number of listings for all roles. In other words, “AI layoffs” seem more PR play or justification for job cuts. But upskilling with AI is critical. The landmark lawsuit against Google for being an online search monopoly concludes by Labor Day (September 1). The DoJ asks for: Google, on the other hand, agrees to end exclusive agreements, so we know Google and Apple will divorce, but opposes a Chrome divestiture and data sharing mandates. The remedy ruling could have significant implications on the AI race, and where marketers should place their money. For example, a Chrome divestiture could significantly set Google back, as OpenAI and Perplexity launch their own browsers. It would also mean a material loss in user behavior data and agentic AI capabilities. Losing the exclusive agreement with Apple could also mean that more users set other browsers than Chrome as default, if they can provide a strong benefit. However, I personally think the most realistic outcome is a forced end to exclusive agreements and would be shocked to see a Chrome divestiture. For context: The second half of 2025 will likely be defined by adaptation rather than resistance. Companies that succeed will be those that foster trust beyond Google, build direct audience relationships, and upskill teams in AI. Here’s what I expect for the second half of the year: Accelerating Traffic Decline AI Mode Launch Publisher Adaptation Measurement Evolution Market Restructuring Featured Image: Paulo Bobita/Search Engine Journal Kevin Indig is a Growth advisor who helps the world’s market leaders define and evolve their Organic Growth strategy.

Title: Could AI Kill Off Hollywood’s Talent Pipeline?

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Many top-tier directors and producers came into the business by doing the grunt work that AI may soon handle As writer Van Robichaux puts it, he only has an agent because an assistant read one of his scripts, liked it and flagged the right person. That assistant went on to become a producer on the Oscar-nominated “The Brutalist.” He got his start, like many executives in Hollywood, reviewing scripts and passing them to higher-level decision makers, according to Robichaux, who declined to name the person. But as the presence of artificial intelligence expands throughout the industry, low-level jobs like a script reader will be among the first to disappear. “Would his job even exist if they didn’t need assistants reading all the screenplays coming over the transom?” Robichaux said in an AI roundtable hosted by WrapPRO last week. “If his job doesn’t exist, does he not become a producer and does ‘The Brutalist’ not get made? “Worst of all, would I have a career?” The hypothetical question posed by Robichaux, who has written episodes of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and is writing the “Wedding Crashers” sequel, has a firm basis in reality, with AI promising to handle a lot of the lower-level grunt work for everyone. It’s happening faster than you think, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei telling Axios that he expects the technology to wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs over the next one to five years (although he wouldn’t be the first tech executive to make overly aggressive predictions). But what’s less discussed is the consequence of losing some or even all of those entry-level jobs, whose real value lies in bringing in young talent and educating them about the business from the ground up. That kind of institutional knowledge is invaluable in a field as complicated and politically fraught as entertainment, and the industry risks losing what is essentially a training ground for the next-generation of decision makers. “It does create a pipeline problem,” Robichaux said. “Every single major Hollywood producer started with a low-level industry job that is going away.” In India, thousands of people grow up aspiring to work for consumer goods giant Unilever. Once hired, the company sends that new hire to a rural community to sell soap, according to Arun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at research firm Gartner. That’s because the company wants the employee to understand how consumers buy their products and how price sensitivity actually works in the real world. It’s a practical example of the kind of institutional knowledge a person gains when doing entry-level work as they work their way up the ranks of their field, and isn’t different from the kind of skills, hacks and short-hand communication you pick up on the set of a film or show. But what happens to that experience when AI starts to replace these positions? There’s the risk that short-term gain in reduced costs may come at the expense of talent with the necessary critical thinking skills to lead down the line. “We would lose some of that lower-level tacit knowledge, which is important for higher-level decisions,” Chandrasekaran said. Talent agencies, for instance, start trainees in the mailroom, having them progress as assistants handling administrative tasks before eventually getting the chance to become an agent. Likewise, script readers and assistants get a chance to absorb nuances of the entertainment business, learning what works and what doesn’t work with audiences as they end up being the producers or writers of the next generation. Losing those positions means one of the more realistic entrances into entertainment is shut off. Getting into Hollywood is already difficult, oftentimes reliant more on who you know vs. what you can do. With fewer opportunities up for grabs, it could just get worse. “AI could accelerate the existing dynamics,” said Brian Justie, a senior research analyst at the UCLA Labor Center. Hollywood has been relatively conservative when it comes to adopting AI, so you can look to the more aggressive tech industry as a bellwether for the impact of the technology. It’s nothing short of brutal. The total tally of layoffs in the tech industry has exceeded 100,000 this year, according to a count conducted by The Bridge Chronicle. That’s been led by big cuts from Microsoft, Meta, Intel and others. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in April said up to 30% of his company’s code is now written by AI; over the next three months, his company laid off 15,000 employees. Google was willing to spend $2.4 billion to hire a CEO and a few engineers because their AI expertise was specifically focused on programming to replace coders. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees, “In the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” While the entertainment industry may not follow tech’s playbook to a tee, it’s not a stretch to see the allure of cutting costs inspiring similar moves. Advancements in AI capabilities around VFX could potentially see layoffs in that area alone. Not everyone thinks the end of grunt work for a new hire spells doom for the industry. Scott Mann, founder and co-CEO of Flawless AI, a post-production visual effects company, said AI could potentially change what an entry-level position looks like. Traditionally, it’s incredibly difficult to jump into a position where you’re directing or writing a film. But AI tools will eventually make it easier to craft films from the get go, said Mann, who was also on the WrapPRO AI roundtable. You’re already seeing it with creators, with tools provided by the likes of YouTube and TikTok enabling more polished videos. “It’s scary because it’s not what we know,” he said. “But it changes what ‘entry-level’ could look like.” Hannah Elsakr, vice president of global GenAI new business ventures at Adobe, echoed the sentiment, noting that new hires may enter at a different level without the grunt work. She added that it’s happening with coders, and that the more sophisticated work required, whether it’s creative or coding, may help companies identify the “real gems” earlier, allowing them to advance faster. It’s also unclear if AI will actually replace all of these tasks. While the technology has made huge leaps over the last three years, there remain limitations, particularly on the creative side. Justie warned that AI won’t have the same impact across all jobs. It’s clear there’s a shift happening with increasing comfort in relying on AI and bots to handle tasks for us. But what happens if that institutional knowledge built up over experience and grunt work goes away? “The risk is we become so dependent on AI, when we have a catastrophic element that AI doesn’t foresee, we can’t make decisions,” Chandrasekaran said. And if Hollywood is anything, it’s unpredictable and, at times, even catastrophic.

Title: Trump’s tariffs could squeeze US factories and boost costs by up to 4.5%, a new analysis finds
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/29/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing-impact/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T12:52:41Z

By JOSH BOAK and PAUL WISEMAN, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants” if the costs are untenable. The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump’s policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation,” Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there’s the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow” show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn’t say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn’t blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’” he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.”

U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) sank roughly 20% in premarket trading after the Danish drugmaker cut its full-year outlook and named a new CEO. Novo Nordisk, which makes blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, now expects 2025 sales growth at constant exchange rates of 8% to 14%, down from its early May forecast of 13% to 21%. It attributed the cut to lower growth expectations for Wegovy and Ozempic in the U.S. obesity and diabetes markets, respectively, and "lower-than-expected penetration" in some international markets. Novo Nordisk named Maziar Mike Doustdar as its next CEO, effective Aug. 7, when he will replace Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen. In May, the company announced Jørgensen would be stepping down once a new chief executive was selected. Novo Nordisk said that the sales outlook for Wegovy in the U.S. "reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition," indicating that it belives some competing products are being sold illegally. The company sees 2025 operating profit growth, or EBIT, of 10% to 16%, down from its prior projection of 16% to 24%. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk entered Tuesday down about 20% this year and more than 45% over the past 12 months amid slowing sales growth and studies that showed the active ingredient in rival Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro and Zepbound caused greater weight loss than that of Ozempic and Wegovy.

UPS said it is not providing a revenue or profit forecast "given the current macro-economic uncertainty.” UPS shares entered Tuesday down about 20% this year

Table of contents Email marketing automation is the best way to win all the benefits of personalized campaigns without incurring the expenses of running these campaigns manually at scale. Check this out. Forrester conducted a Total Economic Impact study on GetResponse Max customers. GetResponse Max provides an automation platform that allows businesses to conduct advanced audience segmentation for personalized marketing campaigns. The report showed users of the automation platform saw a return on investment of 305% and net present value of $302,000. Campaign assembly effort was also reduced by 73% while the payback period was just under 3 months. That’s the potential impact of deploying an effective email marketing automation strategy for your eCommerce business. But what does an effective automation strategy look like? This article will share the vital ecommerce email marketing automations every online store needs. We’ll also provide a roundup of the best automation platforms you can use for the job. Discover how email marketing automation can increase ROI and reduce campaign effort by 73%. Learn the essential workflows every online store needs to increase sales and customer lifetime value. Email marketing automation is the process of creating triggers and conditions that ensure your pre-set emails are sent to specific customers when the triggers are activated and the necessary conditions are met. For example, you can set a trigger for an email with a welcome discount to be sent to a user who signs up for your newsletter for the first time. This email will be deployed automatically every time a new email enters your email list. Ecommerce email marketing automation is powered by automation platforms. These automations deliver several benefits, including: The average email marketing ROI is $36 for every $1 spent. As you can imagine, this ROI can drop or go higher depending on your strategy. Email automation optimizes your ROI. This is achieved in various ways. One, automation allows you to deliver the most important messages when it matters most. This is critical because timing can be the difference between a user choosing to take advantage of their welcome discount or not. An effective strategy ensures that the welcome discount is delivered at the right time, when the potential customer is most engaged. Perfect timing is achieved with all email automation workflows, not just welcome discounts. Email marketing automation also optimizes your ROI by reducing the effort you put into campaigns. As the Forrester study above pointed out, users of the GetResponse Max automation platform saw their campaign assembly efforts drop by 73%. This means less time and salaries invested in running email campaigns. You can also expect a high ROI for your email marketing efforts because campaigns will be personalized to resonate with each recipient. Automation platforms can track the product pages users interact with and use that data to send personalized product recommendations, for example. They can also track a user’s purchase history and use the data to cross-sell and upsell relevant products. Email automation eliminates repetitive tasks like segmenting audiences, sending follow-ups, optimizing send times, inserting dynamic content, and even monitoring deliverability. These are incredibly vital marketing tasks, but they’re extremely time-consuming to do manually. Automation allows you to set the segmentation rules, and these will be executed on autopilot until the day you decide to change the rules. It also helps with monitoring when each user opens emails and uses that data to optimize send time. The best automation platforms also support the insertion of dynamic content. This essentially means that email items like the product recommendations can be changed automatically to align with the preferences or interests of each recipient. Basically, automation frees up your time, allowing you to focus on more strategic tasks like brainstorming new campaign ideas, coming up with fresh creatives, and ideating A/B tests. Effective email automation makes your customers feel seen and valued. It also eliminates friction by ensuring that critical communications like order confirmation, as well as shipping and delivery alerts, are delivered on time. Automation supports personalization, which means your customers will only receive messages they’re interested in. This makes customers feel they’re having a one-to-one interaction with your brand. Not only does it boost customer satisfaction and conversion rates, but it can also increase repeat purchases, which boosts your customer lifetime value. Speaking of which…. Ecommerce automation boosts customer lifetime value and average order value through several strategic automations. Consider an automation workflow like customer re-engagement. This workflow targets past customers who have been inactive for an extended period. It brings them back to your store where they can rediscover products they loved and explore new items. Automated upselling and cross-selling email campaigns are also critical for boosting the average order value. Some brands even include these upsells and cross-sells within automated emails, like transactional emails. Here are nine critical automated email campaigns you must create for your online store. A welcome email is deployed when a new user submits their email address to join your subscriber list. This workflow can be customized to have either a one-off email or a series of emails. Welcome emails see extremely high engagement rates. According to the 2024 email marketing benchmarks, these campaigns had an open rate of 83.63% and a click-through rate of 16.60%. For context, the average email open rate is 39.64% That’s why you must automate welcome emails to ensure they’re delivered when your customers are most engaged and expecting them. You can further enhance the effectiveness of these campaigns by adding a time-limited welcome discount. This encourages the user to become a paid customer immediately. Here is what a simple welcome automation workflow looks like. The following template uses a split logic to send different types of welcome emails. A welcome email is your opportunity to introduce your brand, explain what makes you unique, and set expectations with new subscribers. You can also share key links, such as links to your best-selling products and customer support page. Check out this welcome email example from Local Revival. The email includes a decent welcome discount, a brief explanation of what makes the brand unique, and links to best sellers. Abandoned cart recovery emails are sent to customers who add items to the cart but leave your site before completing their purchase. Cart abandonment is a big problem for eCommerce stores. Data shows that up to 70% of online carts are abandoned. An effective cart abandonment email workflow can help you recover a good portion of these sales. For example, iParts, an online store selling auto parts, used the GetResponse Max automation platform to address the cart abandonment issue. The brand deployed one cart abandonment email campaign, which saw an open rate of 30%. More importantly, 20% of the recipients made a purchase. Like a welcome email, cart abandonment email campaigns can be either a single email or a series of emails. A series of cart abandonment emails can produce better results because it allows you to follow up with prospects. Top automation platforms also let you create automation splits where you can target different cart abandoners with different messages to optimize conversions. For example, you can create a split based on the cart value. For instance, users whose cart value is above $150 can receive a cart abandonment email offering an incentive like free shipping or a discount. Here’s an example of a cart abandonment workflow template. An effective cart abandonment email includes an image of the product and a link going directly to the cart. This reduces friction and makes it easier for buyers to complete their orders. You can also include social proof like customer testimonials and product reviews to build trust and help hesitant shoppers feel confident checking out. Finally, compelling discounts can often work the magic to make hesitant customers feel that the deal is too good to pass up. Take a look at this abandoned cart email example by Casper. Casper stays on brand with the comical header that’s bound to grab attention. They’ve also included social proof through a customer testimonial. Which email automation workflow has been most effective for your ecommerce business – welcome series, cart abandonment, or customer reengagement? Customers can lose touch with your business for different reasons. Maybe they made an impulse purchase when they ran into your paid ads on social media and never thought about your brand again. It’s also possible that they got lured away by a competitor’s offer, and they’ve never visited your store again. Whatever the case may be, customer reengagement campaigns are good at reigniting the interest of inactive customers. Automation platforms offer workflow templates to target customers who have not made a purchase from your store within the last 60 days. You can also customize the template to include a custom number of days. Here’s what a winback automation template looks like. Use personalization to make your customer win-back email campaigns more compelling. You can reference the last thing the customer ordered. Tell them how your store now has the same item in different colors, for example. You can also mention related products, what’s new about your brand, and include a welcome-back discount. Here’s one of our favorite customer winback emails to inspire you. Transactional emails are sent in response to specific customer actions on your website. For example, the email can be deployed when a customer creates an account in your store. These emails are extremely important because they confirm critical actions and build trust with the customers. Transactional emails can also be considered as post-purchase emails since most of them are sent after a customer has placed their order. Here are some examples of these emails. You will need different workflows for each of these emails. Automation software integrates with your eCommerce platform to track when a customer makes a purchase to complete their order. This action triggers the order confirmation email. Once your systems show that the order has been fulfilled, the email platform deploys the order delivery confirmation email. Take a look at this example of a GDPR-compliant confirmation email workflow. Customers who have consented to receive marketing emails can get an order confirmation email with upsells and cross-sells using this workflow. Meanwhile, those who have shared their consent will only get a standard confirmation email. Check out this order confirmation email. Crate & Barrel confirms the order briefly and then takes advantage of the high engagement rates of confirmation emails to cross-sell other products. Sometimes, prospective customers arrive at your store and discover the products they were interested in are out of stock. One way to make sure that you don’t lose these prospects forever is to ask them to submit their email address, so you can notify them when the items are back in stock. Therefore, back-in-stock email notifications are sent to customers when the items they showed interest in have been restocked. These emails can help you recover some of the lost sales. Effective back-in-stock emails can have high conversion rates since you’re targeting leads that have already shown interest and buying intent. Here’s an example of a back-in-stock email. Product replenishment reminders are one of the most effective ways to increase repeat customers and boost the customer lifetime value. These emails are designed to be sent after a specific duration to remind customers that they need to restock their consumable goods. Skincare products, vitamins, supplements, shaving razors, baby diapers, and pet foods are all examples of consumable products that could be the subject of product replenishment reminders. Timing and cadence are critical for the success of these automated email campaigns. You don’t want to send the reminders too soon, and you also don’t want to wait too long. Analyze your customer purchase data to determine the average time it takes for your customers to reorder their supplies. You’ll also need to use dynamic triggers here. Some customers may buy supplies to last them a week. Others shop on a monthly basis. That means a one-size-fits-all automation workflow won’t work. You’ll need to track the purchase behavior and history of each customer to determine when each reminder should be deployed. Personalization is essential for the success of these campaigns. Reference the customer’s past orders in your email subject line and body. Use a one-click reorder CTA that automatically adds all the items. This saves the customer time, meaning they won’t need to look for and add the items to the cart from scratch. Here’s an example of a replenishment reminder. You can also offer incentives, such as loyalty bonuses, to customers who choose to reorder their items. Product replenishment reminders also present opportunities for upselling. You can upsell the customer to an auto-ship program, for example. This generates predictable cash flow for you while keeping your customers engaged. It can also boost revenue by encouraging repeat purchases. Plus, it ensures your loyal customers never run out of their favorite essentials. Create sophisticated email automation workflows that drive sales and increase customer lifetime value. Our drag-and-drop editor and pre-built templates make it easy to set up professional campaigns in minutes. Browse abandonment emails target customers who went through one or several product pages in your online store but left without making a purchase. These automated emails work just like cart abandonment emails but with a different trigger. The condition used for these workflows is “visited page,” as shown below. You must also create a filter to exclude folks who may have visited and exited that page but bought something else from another page. These automated emails would typically share images of the products that potential customers had viewed and might include incentives such as discounts and free shipping to encourage conversions. The best browse abandonment emails also highlight related products. This section can help bring customers back to your site in case they didn’t make a purchase because they didn’t like the products they were viewing. It informs the customer of other options they might find more appealing. It can be items in different styles or the same item they looked at, but in a different color or price point. The email copy does a great job creating a sense of urgency and FOMO. Celebrating your customers with heartwarming messages and exclusive discounts during their key milestones is an effective way to strengthen customer relationships and build loyalty. Birthday and anniversary emails do precisely that by tracking your customer’s key dates and sending celebratory messages. Here’s the workflow for these emails. Anniversary and birthday emails can include exclusive discounts to help your customers celebrate their special day in style. You can also use dynamic content to highlight the customer’s favorite products based on their purchase history. The email has a playful tone and includes a bold CTA going directly to the featured product in the hero section. You can automate customer feedback collection in various ways. One is to include the feedback collection link in a transactional email. You can add the link in the order delivery email, for example. Another way to collect customer feedback is by creating a dedicated email workflow for feedback requests. The best part about this workflow is that you can use a time delay to ensure the email is sent a few days after the customer has received their order. This allows them to provide objective product reviews and overall customer experience feedback based on their experience using the product and buying from your store. Customer feedback, like product reviews, gives you social proof you can use to promote your products. The feedback also helps you improve the customer experience by highlighting friction points you need to address. Therefore, you do want to create a compelling copy that encourages customers to share their feedback. J.Crew sends a separate feedback request email to collect product reviews from its customers. The email is straightforward and makes the process painless for customers by including links to where customers can leave a review for each product. What’s your biggest challenge with ecommerce email automation – setting up workflows, personalizing content, or measuring ROI? Here are seven of the best marketing automation software solutions you can use to automate various aspects of your email marketing strategy. GetResponse offers advanced email marketing automation tools to help you reach your audience at the right time with the right message. Our platform lets you build personalized automation workflows so each customer can feel seen and valued. These workflows have helped brands like Poko Lorente and Eveline Cosmetics drive incredible online sales. Poko Lorente witnessed a $49,000 monthly value of AI product recommendations added to cart, while Eveline Cosmetics saw $13,000 in monthly sales from a single campaign, $ 7,000 of which came from product recommendations. The GetResponse automation platform is also user-friendly. For starters, we provide plenty of pre-built templates to simplify and speed up the workflow creation process. We have templates for workflows like cart abandonment, customer re-engagement, and birthday and anniversary emails. These templates are also customizable, so you can adjust the conditions and split the workflows to create more targeted automation campaigns. For marketers who prefer to build their workflows from scratch, we provide a visual drag-and-drop editor to help with just that. The platform integrates with popular eCommerce solutions, such as Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento, and WooCommerce. This integration allows you to track user behavior on your site. It can track the URL or product pages they visit, for example. This triggers personalized product recommendations. Our platform also supports advanced customer segmentation. You can create customer profiles with an unlimited number of tags. Data, like the emails your customers open, can also be used to generate engagement scores. These insights allow you to create precise customer segments for personalized automated email campaigns. GetResponse’s automation features are available from the Marketer plan, which costs $48.38/mo. This plan supports contact tagging, contact scoring, visited URL automation, event-based automation, ecommerce tracking, and purchase automation. You’ll also have access to unlimited automation templates and can build unlimited workflows from scratch. For enterprises, the GetResponse Max plan provides the best tools to help you meet the needs and expectations of your vast customer base while staying compliant. The plan includes assisted IP warmup, dedicated sending domain, single sign-on, SMTP connection, and API access. G2 rating: 4.3 out of 5 Klaviyo comes with an in-built customer data platform (CDP). This platform can host all the rich data from the different tools and platforms your eCommerce store uses. It pulls data from your eCommerce platform and payment processing systems, for example. The data is then used to power marketing automation workflows. You can use this data to create precise customer segments and send super personalized email campaigns. However, access to the Advanced Klaviyo Data Platform is available as a separate add-on that costs $500 per month. Klaviyo also supports behavior-based automation. The platform can track and use real-time behavior and customer data to send personalized email messages instantly. Split logic is another capability available on Klaviyo automations. This feature puts customers through different paths based on specific conditions and triggers. For example, you can split the type of “Thank you” message a customer receives after responding to a feedback request email. You can set it up so that customers who provide detailed feedback with visuals can receive a special discount code for their next order in the Thank-you email. Klaviyo email is available for $45 per month, with a limit of 15,000 monthly emails. This plan includes the drag-and-drop automation builder, workflow templates, and product recommendations. Unfortunately, both the data platform ($500/mo) and SMS automation ($60/mo for email + SMS) are available as separate add-ons. Additionally, the automated product review request tool is sold separately, starting at $25 per month. This makes Klaviyo one of the more expensive eCommerce email marketing automation solutions. Check our guide to the top Klaviyo alternatives if you want to see how other tools compare. G2 rating: 4.6 out of 5 Omnisend automates critical steps within the customer journey across several marketing channels, including email and SMS. The platform provides prebuilt automation workflows, complete with prebuilt email subject lines and messages, to help you set up and deploy your automated campaigns in no time. These workflows are fully customizable, so you can edit them to include custom triggers and conditions and even split the workflows. This is done through a visual automation editor. Omnisend’s automation platform supports A/B testing. You can test the messages and incentives used within your workflows to see what resonates the most with your audience. Omnisend offers a decent free plan that includes several automation features, such as pre-built e-commerce workflows, conditional content blocks, automation splits, and custom workflows. However, the free plan only accommodates 500 email sends per month. That’s very little, so most stores will need to upgrade to the paid plans. The recommended Pro plan starts at $41.30 for a contact list size of 1,001 to 1,500. This plan offers unlimited monthly email sends, personalized product recommendations, and advanced reporting. G2 rating: 4.6 out of 5 Mailchimp is one of the most well-known email marketing tools. The platform provides email automation solutions, like the intuitive drag-and-drop automation builder. You also get ready-made templates for popular eCommerce workflows, such as a welcome series, cart recovery, and winback email campaigns. Mailchimp integrates with over 300 apps to help you track customer behavior and deploy automated email marketing campaigns based on real-time actions. You can build automations and create up to 4 flow steps using Mailchimp’s Essentials plan, which costs $26.50/mo for 1,500 contacts. You’ll need at least the Standard plan, which goes for $45/mo for 1,500 contacts, to unlock more automation workflow steps (up to 200). The Standard plan also supports dynamic content, send time optimization, multivariate testing, predictive segmentation, and behavioral targeting. G2 rating: 4.3 out of 5 Brevo’s automation tools help you personalize the customer journey to boost engagement and increase sales. The platform can track customer behavior, like the messages they open and click. It also provides prebuilt workflows for recovering abandoned carts, welcoming new subscribers, and celebrating customer birthdays and anniversaries. Plus, you can create your own workflows from scratch with their workflow builder. Brevo supports advanced audience segmentation. You can group your email list subscribers based on their activities in your store, the actions they take, and their purchase history. Brevo’s automation features are available across all plans, including the free package. The difference lies in the number of emails you can send. The free plan limits you to just 300 emails per day and automations for up to 2,000 contacts. The Starter plan supports unlimited automated email sends at $8.08/mo. Marketing automations are still capped at 2,000 contacts. Also, you’ll need to pay an extra $10.80 for a total of $18.88/mo to remove Brevo branding from your emails. The Business plan costs $16.17 per month and includes additional features like send time optimization, A/B testing, and unlimited marketing automation. G2 rating: 4.5 out of 5 Mailerlite integrates with various e-commerce tools, including Stripe, Make, Shopify, WordPress, and WooCommerce. These deep integrations help you track sales and customer behavior on your site to create personalized, automated email campaigns. Mailerlite automates various stages of the customer journey, starting with welcome emails to post-purchase emails like customer survey campaigns. It gives you access to both prebuilt workflow templates and a workflow editor. Mailerlite’s workflow editor allows you to add up to three triggers for a single workflow. This adds efficiency to your processes. Instead of building and maintaining three separate workflows, you can create one with three different triggers. Email automation is available on both the free and Growing Business($13.50/mo for 1,000 contacts) plans. However, these plans have limited capabilities. For example, you don’t get multiple automation triggers, and the automation templates are also limited. You’ll need the Advanced plan ($27/mo for 1,000 contacts) to access multiple automation triggers and unlimited automation templates. G2 rating: 4.6 out of 5 ActiveCampaign helps you build more responsive customer experiences through automations powered by customer data and real-time behaviors. Setting up these automations is fairly straightforward. In addition to prebuilt workflows, the platform provides a conversational AI assistant that works with you to bring your automation ideas to life. ActiveCampaign integrates with over 900 platforms. This helps with tracking customer behavior across your online store, for example. Site and event tracking is then used to send personalized product recommendation emails. The email automation tools also support conditional and split logics. That allows you to build branching paths so you can deliver tailored experiences to each customer. You can also split-test your automations to optimize your campaigns and make sure you’re not leaving any money on the table. Marketing automation is available on the $15/mo Starter plan. You’re limited to up to five actions per automation on this plan. Segmentation is also limited in that plan. The Plus package costs $49/mo and supports unlimited actions per automation. More powerful features, like predictive sending, conditional content, advanced segmentation, and attribution and conversion tracking, are available on the Pro plan, which starts at $79/month.

Josh Boak And Paul Wiseman Associated Press Published: July 29, 2025 at 5:52 AM Updated: July 29, 2025 at 7:41 AM Recommended Videos Josh Boak And Paul Wiseman Associated Press WASHINGTON – As President Donald Trump prepares to announce new tariff increases, the costs of his policies are starting to come into focus for a domestic manufacturing sector that depends on global supply chains, with a new analysis suggesting factory costs could increase by roughly 2% to 4.5%. “There’s going to be a cash squeeze for a lot of these firms,” said Chris Bangert-Drowns, the researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth who conducted the analysis. Those seemingly small changes at factories with slim profit margins, Bangert-Drowns said, “could lead to stagnation of wages, if not layoffs and closures of plants" if the costs are untenable. Recommended Videos The analysis, released Tuesday, points to the challenges Trump might face in trying to sell his tariffs to the public as a broader political and economic win and not just as evidence his negotiating style gets other nations to back down. The success of Trump's policies ultimately depends on whether everyday Americans become wealthier and factory towns experience revivals, a goal outside economists say his Republican administration is unlikely to meet with tariffs. Trump has announced new frameworks with the European Union, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain that would each raise the import taxes charged by the United States. He’s prepared to levy tariffs against goods from dozens of other countries starting on Friday in the stated range of 15% to 50%. The U.S. stock market has shown relief the tariff rates aren’t as high as Trump initially threatened in April and hope for a sense of stability going forward. Trump maintains the tariff revenues will whittle down the budget deficit and help whip up domestic factory jobs, all while playing down the risks of higher prices. “We’ve wiped out inflation," Trump said last Friday before boarding Marine One while on his way to Scotland. But there's the possibility of backlash in the form of higher prices and slower growth once tariffs flow more fully through the world economy. A June survey by the Atlanta Federal Reserve suggested companies would on average pass half of their tariff costs onto U.S. consumers through higher prices. Labor Department data shows America lost 14,000 manufacturing jobs after Trump rolled out his April tariffs, putting a lot of pressure as to whether a rebound starts in the June employment report coming out Friday. With new tariffs in place, there are new costs for factories The Washington Center for Equitable Growth analysis shows how Trump’s devotion to tariffs carries potential economic and political costs for his agenda. In the swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, more than 1 in 5 jobs are in the critical sectors of manufacturing, construction, mining and oil drilling and maintenance that have high exposures to his import taxes. The artificial intelligence sector Trump last week touted as the future of the economy is dependent on imports. More than 20% of the inputs for computer and electronics manufacturing are imported, so the tariffs could ultimately magnify a hefty multitrillion-dollar price tag for building out the technology in the U.S. The White House argues American businesses will access new markets because of the trade frameworks, saying companies will ultimately benefit as a result. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. Still lots of uncertainty, but world economy faces a new toll There are limits to the analysis. Trump’s tariff rates have been a moving target, and the analysis looks only at additional costs, not how those costs will be absorbed among foreign producers, domestic manufacturers and consumers. Also, the legal basis of the tariffs as an “emergency” act goes before a U.S. appeals court on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last week on Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow" show countries were essentially accepting the tariffs to maintain access to the U.S. market. “Everyone is willing to pay a toll,” he said. But what Bessent didn't say is U.S. manufacturers are also paying much of that toll. “We’re getting squeezed from all sides,’’ said Justin Johnson, president of Jordan Manufacturing Co. in Belding, Michigan, northeast of Grand Rapids. His grandfather founded the company in 1949. The company, which makes parts used by Amazon warehouses, auto companies and aerospace firms, has seen the price of a key raw material — steel coil — rise 5% to 10% this year. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Jordan Manufacturing doesn’t buy foreign steel. But by crippling foreign competition, Trump’s tariffs have allowed domestic U.S. steelmakers to hike prices. Johnson doesn't blame them. “There’s no red-blooded capitalist who isn’t going to raise his prices’’ under those circumstances, he said. Trump says no inflation from tariffs, but businesses see higher prices The Trump White House insists inflation is not surfacing in the economy, issuing a report through the Council of Economic Advisers this month saying the price of imported goods fell between December of last year and this past May. “These findings contradict claims that tariffs or tariff-fears would lead to an acceleration of inflation,” the report concludes. Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said that the more accurate measure would be to compare the trends in import prices with themselves in the past and that the CEA’s own numbers show “import prices have accelerated in recent months.” The latest estimate from the Budget Lab at Yale is the tariffs would cause the average household to have $2,400 less than it would otherwise have. Keeping the economy on a knife's edge Josh Smith, founder and president of Montana Knife Co., called himself a Trump voter but said he sees the tariffs on foreign steel and other goods as threatening his business. For instance, Smith just ordered a $515,000 machine from Germany that grinds his knife blades to a sharp edge. Trump had imposed a 10% tax on products from the EU that is set to rise to 15% under the trade framework he announced Sunday. So Trump’s tax on the machine comes to $77,250 — about enough for Smith to hire an entry-level worker. Smith would happily buy the bevel-grinding machines from an American supplier. But there aren’t any. “There’s only two companies in the world that make them, and they’re both in Germany,’’ Smith said. Then there’s imported steel, which Trump is taxing at 50%. Until this year, Montana Knife bought the powdered steel it needs from Crucible Industries in Syracuse, New York. But Crucible declared bankruptcy last December, and its assets were purchased by a Swedish firm, Erasteel, which moved production to Sweden. Smith beat the tariffs by buying a year’s worth of the steel in advance. But starting in 2026, the specialty steel he’ll be importing from Sweden is set to be hit with a 50% duty. “The average American is not sitting in the position I am, looking at the numbers I am and making the decisions each day, like, ‘Hey, we cannot hire those extra few people because we might have to pay this tariff on this steel or this tariff on this grinder,’'' he said. “I want to buy more equipment and hire more people. That’s what I want to do.” Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

Title: Novo Nordisk lowers sales and operating profit outlook for 2025

July 29, 2025 07:02 ET | Source: Novo Nordisk A/S Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsværd, Denmark, 29 July 2025 – Novo Nordisk today announced sales and operating profit growth at constant exchange rates (CER) for the first six months of 2025 and updated full-year sales and operating profit outlook at CER. In the first six months of 2025, Novo Nordisk’s sales increased by 18% and operating profit increased by 29%, both at CER. Sales growth in the first six months of 2025 was positively impacted by gross-to-net sales adjustments related to prior years, including an adjustment related to the 340B provision of around DKK 3 billion in the second quarter of 2025. Operating profit growth is positively impacted by the ocedurenone impairment in the second quarter of 2024, partially countered by impacts related to the acquisition of the three Catalent manufacturing sites. Novo Nordisk has updated the full-year outlook for 2025, with sales growth now expected to be 8-14% and operating profit growth expected to be 10-16%, both at CER. Sales and operating profit growth reported in Danish kroner is now expected to be 4 and 7 percentage points lower than at CER, respectively, primarily due to depreciation of the USD/DKK exchange rate1. The lowered sales outlook for 2025 is driven by lower growth expectations for the second half of 2025. This is related to lower growth expectations for Wegovy® in the US obesity market, lower growth expectations for Ozempic® in the US GLP-1 diabetes market, as well as lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy® in select IO markets. For Wegovy® in the US, the sales outlook reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition. Despite the expiry of the FDA grace period for mass compounding on 22 May 2025, Novo Nordisk market research shows that unsafe and unlawful mass compounding has continued, and that multiple entities continue to market and sell compounded GLP-1s under the false guise of ‘personalisation’. Novo Nordisk is pursuing multiple strategies, including litigation, to protect patients from knockoff ‘semaglutide’ drugs. Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff ‘semaglutide’ drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients. As unsafe and unlawful mass compounding continues, the Wegovy® penetration within the cash channel has been lower-than-expected. Within this channel, NovoCare® Pharmacy was launched in March 2025. Wegovy® prescriptions via NovoCare® Pharmacy (including TeleHealth collaborations) amount to around 11,000 total weekly prescriptions, in addition to around 20,000 weekly prescriptions in the retail cash channel. Novo Nordisk will continue to invest in the expansion of direct-to-patient initiatives such as NovoCare® Pharmacy and further collaborations with telehealth organisations. Within the insured channel, despite the initiation of new commercial activities of Wegovy® in the first half of 2025, the sales outlook also reflects lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy®, mainly due to slower market expansion and competition. Novo Nordisk continues to engage in additional commercial initiatives and expects a regulatory decision around the Wegovy® MASH indication during the second half of 2025. Moreover, Novo Nordisk continues to expect a positive contribution from changes to the CVS national template formulary effective 1 July 2025, where Wegovy® is now the only GLP-1 medicine covered for obesity. For Ozempic®, the updated outlook is negatively impacted by competition in the US. Novo Nordisk continues to invest in commercial activities and label updates towards driving further market penetration of Ozempic®. Finally, while IO Wegovy® sales are growing at high rates and launches are progressing, the sales outlook reflects lower-than-expected penetration for Wegovy® in select IO markets due to slower market expansion and competition. With around 1 billion people living with obesity globally and only a few million on treatment, the outlook reflects a continued global rollout of Wegovy® to more markets. The updated expectation for operating profit growth reflects the lower sales growth outlook, partially countered by reduced spending. A negative mid-single-digit operating profit growth impact related to the acquisition of the three former Catalent manufacturing sites remains included in the guidance. Novo Nordisk now expects financial items (net) for 2025 to amount to a gain of around DKK 3 billion. This is mainly driven by expected gains on hedged currencies, primarily the US dollar, partially offset by interest expenses related to funding of the debt-financed Catalent transaction. Finally, the free cash flow is now expected to be DKK 35-45 billion, reflecting the lower-than-planned expected sales growth, mainly driven by lower volume growth of GLP-1-based treatments in the US and related cash flow implications amplified by the US gross-to-net system. Novo Nordisk’s full disclosure of the financial results for the first six months of 2025 will be published on 6 August 2025, where more information will be available. The above expectations are based on additional assumptions, including assumptions described on pages 14 and 15 of the Financial report for the first three months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 14/2025). The forward-looking statements on page 23 in the Financial report for the first three months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 14/2025) also apply to this company announcement. Conference call Novo Nordisk will host a conference call for investors at 14.30 CEST on 29 July 2025, corresponding to 8.30 am EST.

Illustration by Guillem Casasús; Getty (3) Bill McKibbenSeptember+October 2025 Issue Earlier this summer, Tara McDermott, who’s in charge of policy communications for a New York state solar developer called EmPower Solar, was telling me a woeful tale a lot like others I’d been hearing lately. A customer whom I’ll call Pam had tried to put solar panels on top of her home in Mount Vernon to save money and help the planet. EmPower submitted its first permit application to the city in September 2023 and then went back and forth with them for months as the city asked for revisions, updated proof of insurance, and other documentation from Pam. Eventually, one of McDermott’s colleagues got fed up and reached out to the mayor for assistance—in fact, he drove to City Hall and asked to see her. Upon being told that she wasn’t in her office, he said he’d sit there and wait for her return. “It turns out the mayor was indeed there in her office and couldn’t leave without passing him,” McDermott recalled, warming to her tale. “So they called the police on my guy to remove him from the space—they deemed him a threat.” Eventually, after some negotiation, two cops were detailed to accompany the EmPower employee upstairs to the building department, and they all sat there for two hours while staff worked on the permit for the solar panels. But not, unfortunately, the permit for the electric wiring that goes with it. Before that step could happen, Pam’s loan agreement expired. “There are no options left and she probably can’t go solar. And we’ve spent hundreds of hours on this one house,” McDermott told me. This tale was absurd enough on its own. But then she said something else, almost in passing: “Our CEO went to southern Spain two years ago during all this, just staying with some friends at their house there. And they wanted solar, and he was the solar guy, so they asked him. They all went to the local store, something like Best Buy, and they picked the system he recommended and signed up, and by the time he left Spain two weeks later, it was already installed and running. This wasn’t DIY or under the radar. They did it legally. Imagine that world.” In many countries, people don’t have to imagine it. A million and a half Germans have installed “balcony solar”—they simply went to the big-box store, bought a giant panel for a few hundred euros, hung it from their apartment railing, and produced up to a quarter of their household’s power needs. Other European countries have followed suit. Ditto Australia, where Saul Griffith, author of the new book Plug In!, notes that permits can be had in a single day using a smartphone app—“the tradie [contractor] often does this for you. In Australia, it takes two or three days once you’ve made the decision to do it to get the system up and running.” But not in America, where President Donald Trump and his Republican allies are pulling out all the stops to destroy renewable power. They’ve shut down big offshore wind projects, they’re limiting projects on public lands, and the “Big Beautiful Bill” not only rolled back tax credits for large-scale renewable projects, it took direct aim at precisely the kind of rooftop solar work that thousands of small contractors like EmPower produce. Upon news that the bill would phase out tax credits for residential solar by the end of 2025, the already depressed stock price of Sunrun, the country’s biggest residential solar provider, fell 40 percent; PV Magazine, the industry trade journal, headlined its story “U.S. Residential Solar on the Brink of Collapse.” That’s a very real possibility—we’ve seen the same thing once before, when the Reagan administration withdrew federal support for solar installers and, almost overnight, the solar workforce plummeted. The cuts the GOP-controlled Congress pushed through in July could take out as many as 400,000 jobs, per recent estimates. Notably, these latest efforts come after the two hottest years in human history and at a moment when, worldwide, solar power is growing faster than any energy source in history—putting both the planet and the country’s technological leadership at risk. So giving in to Trump’s attack is not an option. Instead, we need to figure out how to keep rooftop solar growing even without the federal tax credits that have spurred it in the recent past. Doing that will require, among other things, unclogging the peculiarly American system of local permitting that has played a huge role in making “going solar” far more expensive than it needs to be. If Pam’s system had gone up in an afternoon with far less paperwork, we’d be in a very different place—a place where the “abundance” debate meets the climate crisis and offers a real way out. “It’s so cheap to build a solar panel now. It’s cheaper than producing a plank of wood…But we’ve swaddled this engineering miracle in rolls and rolls of red tape to make it too expensive for American families.” Let’s go back to Australia for a moment. Down under, Griffith says, “rooftop solar installs at about 55 cents a watt, meaning electricity that ends up costing 2 or 3 cents a kilowatt-hour. In the US, it averages about $2.50 a watt, and in San Francisco, I paid $5.80 per watt.” That means it takes much longer to recoup the cost of a project and far fewer people are willing to take it on. About a third of Australian homes now have rooftop solar—seven times more than in America. The glacial speed of our local permitting plays a huge role. Contractors have to keep “rolling trucks” to revisit your roof and redraw plans. By some estimates, a one-week delay can result in a 10 percent client cancellation rate, which means solar developers have to spend ever more money on customer acquisition. (You’ve seen the ads.) Meanwhile, interest accrues on any loans taken out to finance such projects—it all adds up. The slow permitting is not the only problem—once the panels are on the roof, utilities often drag their feet in connecting them to the grid, part of the fossil fuel industry’s ongoing war against renewables. Some areas have made meaningful progress with this “interconnection” problem, and the work to push utilities to move faster continues, often at the level of state public utility commissions and the seven “independent system operators,” or ISOs, that run the nation’s grid. But these big power players can’t do much about, say, the Mount Vernon building inspector. America’s commitment to local control enables a tangle of entities to set the pace of solar growth. Happily, because many of those jurisdictions are firmly in blue hands, there’s still plenty to be done, even with Washington doing its damnedest to sabotage clean energy. Democratic leaders seem to be warming to the abundance agenda—at least they’re finally talking about whether America can be reconfigured to once more build ambitious projects. But even if we could wave a magic wand and get projects like high-speed rail or clean-power transmission corridors moving, such monumental efforts will take a while and, as with former President Joe Biden’s spending on clean energy, voters might never notice the improvement—or know who deserves the credit. But up on your own roof? You notice that. If you could easily get a permit to install a low-cost machine that could save you money, and, oh yes, also help ward off the civilizational challenge that is climate change, you might start thinking a little differently about government. Forget YIMBYs for a moment—we’re talking YOMRs. You’ve got a right to the sunshine that falls on your home, whether you’re a renter with a balcony or a homeowner. Free the electron! We’re used to thinking of roofs as protection from rain—but the sun can also provide a shower of dollars and cents, and some bureaucrat shouldn’t force you to stay at the mercy of Big Utility. Why should the Chinese and the Australians and the Germans get access to the sun while you’re denied it? I mean, what the hell—we’re bathed in free energy every daylight hour and we need a bunch of permits to use it? What’s American about that? “It’s so cheap to build a solar panel now,” says Nick Josefowitz, who runs the advocacy group Permit Power. “It’s cheaper than producing a plank of wood. It’s one of the great engineering miracles of our lifetimes. But we’ve swaddled this engineering miracle in rolls and rolls of red tape to make it too expensive for American families.” Although they’re reluctant to say it publicly, some industry people I spoke with said that it was possible to imagine a robust solar industry without any government subsidies (see Australia)—so long as bureaucracy got out of the way. Want to prove government can still work? Looking for ways to balance American individualism with concern for the collective good we call “the environment”? Ready to shake off the fossil fuel oligarchy that helped lead this country into its political morass? To the ladders! Rooftop solar is not the only source of clean energy, of course. Utility-scale solar—big solar farms—accounts for twice as much generation in this country and a lot of the startling takeoff in clean energy around the world. But adding big projects to the grid can be complicated—you need new transmission lines and substations, which the Biden administration was working to provide and the Trump administration is now busy blocking. Fossil fuel industry players and some utilities have also deployed astroturf groups to block such projects; according to Heatmap News, this partly explains why, in at least 20 percent of US counties, it’s now essentially impossible to deploy large-scale clean energy. So rooftop solar is a nice complement to the grid, both physically and politically. There’s enough wasted space up above our heads to supply a significant portion of the nation’s energy needs—one study found that we could generate 45 percent of our electricity this way; at the moment, we only harvest about 2 percent. Often, that rooftop array supplies power to the grid and, increasingly, it also fills batteries in the basement, which can not only power the house at night or charge an EV, but also make that house far more adaptable in times of crisis. Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun, said that during the Los Angeles fires, when the power company cut the juice for hundreds of thousands of people out of fear its wires would spark more blazes, “our homes became the safe haven, the place where people could recharge their phones to get the news alerts. This is critical infrastructure.” And the line between rooftop and utility-scale solar has begun to blur; new software allows the aggregation of thousands of home batteries into “virtual power plants” that can be dispatched by a utility to lessen the load on the grid. In California, Sunrun has knit together a network of 75,000 home batteries—together, they could supply enough power to run, say, all of Ventura County (pop. 830,000). In Vermont, where I live, the biggest single power plant on our grid is the network of interconnected batteries that can be called up in a pinch by Green Mountain Power. The nation’s biggest virtual power plant is now being built in Texas by stringing together hundreds of thousands of customers who use Google Nest thermostats. These networks are not just resilient—a single power plant can fail on a hot day, but not 10,000 basement batteries—they also save big money. By reducing the need for utilities to build new power plants to account for “peak loads,” the Department of Energy estimated in 2023 that battery networks could save customers at least $10 billion a year. So, dramatically expanding the amount of solar on the roof would be an unmitigated good. As Solar United Neighbors—a nonprofit that has helped more than 11,000 families go solar, concentrating on low-income neighborhoods—puts it, “demanding utility accountability and deploying distributed solar in under-resourced communities and communities of color can catalyze a shift toward a new, equitable, distributed clean energy system.” But all of that depends, first and foremost, on making rooftop solar cheap so that more and more families and landlords can afford it. And that, in turn, depends in part on dramatically reducing the thicket of regulations that get in the way of easy deployment. There’s enough wasted space up above our heads to supply up to 45 percent of the nation’s electricity needs; at the moment, we only harvest about 2 percent. It’s hard for people to imagine, I think, that permitting costs could make such a difference—surely it’s a marginal part of the cost, compared to, you know, the panels. But the truth is that low-cost manufacturing pioneered by the Chinese has driven hardware costs to bizarre lows. Even before Trump upped the tariffs on foreign panels, Americans were paying three times as much as Australians for rooftop solar, and that’s explained almost entirely by the “soft costs” of permitting, marketing, and installation. Andrew Birch, who had previously lived in Australia, remembers the hopeful days of his startup two decades ago. “We started Sungevity in the US because we thought it would be this free open market where we could sell online easily,” he says. “It turned out to be just the opposite.” When visitors would stop by to see his new operation, it seemed almost magical. “We’d take them to see the sales floor, which was full of people at computers, talking to customers. Even then, you could see a house on Google Earth and calculate quickly how much power solar could provide—our agents could design a system in a few keystrokes. Our visitors were impressed. But then I’d have to say, ‘Let’s go to the other building’—where we had another whole team, doubling the size of the company, doing customer management and permit creation work. It takes an average of three months to set up a system, and five to six months in the Northeast. And all of that head count and work adds $1.50 a watt.” The soft costs are literally more expensive than the hardware—it’s like spending a thousand bucks for an iPhone and then another thousand for the apps. “You have to arrange a site visit and drive a truck out there,” Birch says. “You have to climb up on the roof to get the rafter spacing, do incredibly elaborate electrical drawings. Then you roll another truck to the permit office. They might have different views about how to interpret the drawings, which means change orders, which means another resell to the customer.” All of this would be bad enough if there were a single regulator to respond to, as in most countries. But in America there are something like 20,000 separate jurisdictions—cities, towns, counties—that approve building plans. Each is different. A solar contractor in a metro area might have to deal with a dozen or more permitting offices. Sungevity died during the first Trump administration, but Birch hasn’t given up the fight. He now runs OpenSolar, “the world’s first free, end-to-end platform designed to help solar professionals grow their businesses and streamline their operations.” But those installers still run into permit blockage, which is why Birch spends much of his time proselytizing for another piece of software: It’s called SolarAPP+, and it was originally developed by the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory precisely to make permitting easier. In the several hundred jurisdictions that have adopted the tool, installers go through a checklist—what model of solar panel, what kind of inverters, how they plan to tie into the house’s electrical system—and the app spits out a permit so they can get to work; when they’re finished, an inspector can come out or, in some cases, simply review photos the installers send. Other countries have dispensed with permits altogether (in Australia, spot inspections keep installers on their toes), but in the US, SolarAPP+ is probably as streamlined as we’re likely to get. And where it’s in place, it seems to work. Louis Woofenden, a Tucson-based solar installer, says he can now get permits in a day as opposed to about five weeks in the past. As a result, he can far more easily quote prices to potential customers: “And there’s something to being able to say, ‘I have an installation slot in six weeks,’ not three months.” Matthew McAllister, who runs the SolarAPP Foundation, says about 5 percent of the nation’s residential rooftop projects now get one of its automated permits—it topped 1,000 permits a week for the first time this past spring. “Our goal by the end of the decade is to be able to process half of applications, which would be enough to really influence soft costs and prices.” His organization has mapped out the 1,000 jurisdictions it thinks are likely to install the most solar, and is reaching out to building departments one by one—in the last year, New Orleans and Palm Beach County in Florida have come on board. “One thing we’re always working on is to communicate that we’re a very lightweight software tool,” he says. “A level above a Chrome extension, not an IT replacement. It integrates with their existing software.” Legislatures in California, Maryland, and most recently New Jersey have instructed their local communities to switch to SolarAPP+, and other states are considering it, but it’s always a battle. The Colorado legislature gutted a proposal this past spring to switch its communities to the technology, even though it had the potential to dramatically increase installations and save Coloradans $1 billion on their energy bills by 2030. “Local officials may think, ‘I’ll lose my job,’” Birch says. “We tell them: You’ll do five times as many solar permits. If you’re just inspecting 1 in 5, you’ll do as much work, and the city will get five times the fees.” But that doesn’t mean it’s an easy sell to jurisdictions used to Doing Things a Certain Way. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which developed SolarAPP+, has two campuses in Colorado; Boulder County is a hotspot for climate scientists and has seen terrifying wildfires in recent years. (If you want to scare yourself silly, check out footage of families fleeing a Chuck E. Cheese near a horrendous 2021 blaze.) And yet in March, the county opposed a state bill to require the use of SolarAPP+. Ron Flax, Boulder County’s chief building official, says he’s a “huge fan” of the app, but “making it mandatory is always a little bit controversial. Any bill that tells a jurisdiction you must do X, Y, or Z—well, they value their freedom of choice.” His inspectors, he says, “still find things.” Some years ago, they had installers who weren’t grounding panels correctly—“We don’t have a well-established apprenticeship program for trades in the US; the actual craftsmen, these are not well-paid folks”—but today, he admits, zoning regulations are a bigger headache. In any case, one senses that Flax would be just fine if Boulder residents didn’t want so many solar panels. Building mostly utility-scale solar would be “optimal,” he told me. “If my baseline electric grid is made up of mostly renewables, then I really don’t want a lot of rooftop solar,” he explained. “It’s more efficient to do that at a grid scale.” That kind of attitude—which effectively tables the idea of distributed power generation networks—seems particularly common in progressive communities. Like Boulder, San Francisco is jam-packed with people who care about the climate, but their former mayor and current governor, Gavin Newsom, has emerged as perhaps the country’s most significant obstacle to rooftop solar, deferring to utilities and unions by reducing the price that homeowners can get for the power they sell to the grid; he even vetoed a bill last year that would have made it easier for schools and hospitals to install solar. (“We’re expending so much time, emotional and intellectual energy in Sacramento just not having the space harmed more,” says Sunrun’s Powell.) The Bay Area may be the single hardest place on Earth to permit rooftop projects. Jeanine Cotter, who runs a local solar business, gives an example: “In San Francisco, where land is expensive, we build right to the lot lines, and so one way to get light in a house is with skylights. Our code says you need 3 feet of clearance around every skylight. But if you have a small roof and skylights, well, the ability to play Tetris with solar panels—it just gets harder.” Grace Kennedy-Panda and her sister co-own a Bay Area solar business started by their father in the 1980s. She says the regulations—and fees—change constantly: “Permitting a solar-battery system even recently was $200, and now it can cost three or four thousand dollars. There’s not a whole lot of clarity we can give our customers.” Even installing appliances that in some jurisdictions have become pretty standard can be a bureaucratic rat nest in the Bay Area. Consider electric heat pumps, which replace gas or oil furnaces and are an easy way to cut both energy use and emissions. Getting them permitted is onerous in many Bay Area cities, building decarbonization policy expert Sam Fishman says. Gas furnaces and water heaters are greenlit quickly because building departments are used to them, but put a heat pump water heater in a garage, and you might be subject to requirements that really only make sense for gas appliances, such as raising it on a stand or installing bollards to make sure a car can’t run into it. “There’s an assumption that things need to be done in a perfect, buttoned-up way,” he says. “Checking too many things and going through so much process only adds the most tiny margin of safety and health improvement and is actually costing thousands of dollars.” One possibility is that America will simply sit out the global solar boom in the same way Cubans, thanks to endless embargoes, still drive ’57 Chevys. The extra costs are high enough that many locals install heat pump appliances without pulling permits—but the rebate programs for low-income residents, who benefit the most from these money-saving appliances, all require copies. The problem has reached the point where the California legislature is weighing a “heat pump access act” to standardize and streamline permitting. All this red tape might be necessary if it were in response to some epidemic of fires caused by badly installed solar panels. But that epidemic doesn’t exist—not in Australia, not in Germany, not in California. I’ve spent some of my life as a volunteer firefighter, and I can tell you what causes blazes: not heat pumps or solar panels but space heaters, which are what many poor people use to heat their homes. Think about California, where big gas explosions have caused carnage, and whose massive wildfires are clearly linked to global warming—against which solar panels are the best weapon. Even worse, the sparks that set off these blazes often come from drooping utility transmission lines brushing up against dry foliage—whereas more rooftop solar means fewer new peaker plants and dangerous transmission lines. “We’re over-indexing certain kinds of fire prevention,” Cotter says. “The individual house versus the mass catastrophe. We feel much more comfortable piping natural gas, which we ignite to cook our foods and heat our homes. We know it’s not safe for our planet, nor for the people around it that have to breathe the fumes. But we’re okay doing that because we’ve been doing it for 100 years.” If all of this sounds like a place where an anti-regulatory right might find common ground with an environmentally minded left, well, there are signs of it happening. The deep-red Utah legislature this past winter became the first in the country to allow balcony solar. In the Southeast, a group called Conservatives for Clean Energy has pushed Republican legislators forward on solar power. Its biggest victory came in Florida, where it helped convince Gov. Ron DeSantis to veto anti-solar legislation—in the three years since, the Sunshine State has seen a respectable boom in solar installations. “That allowed us to say, ‘Here’s a Republican governor who helped us save rooftop solar,’” says Mark Fleming, head of CCE and a former aide to former Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.). The group focuses on economic arguments—in many rural counties in the Southeast, solar projects are among the biggest taxpayers—but especially when it comes to rooftop solar, its case is partly ideological. “There’s a private property rights thing—an ‘I’ll do what I want on my land’ kind of argument,” Fleming says. Polling has long found that solar power is popular across the political spectrum. My sense, having lived most of my life in dirt-road districts, both red and blue, is that conservatives are often deeply attracted to the idea of producing their own power. If you have your own energy source up on the shingles, then your home really is your castle. But unless you absolutely reject government authority, you still need those permits. One of Fleming’s board members at CCE, Stew Miller, has run a solar installation company in North Carolina’s Research Triangle for 16 years. “Raleigh has instant permitting, which is great,” he said. “But other jurisdictions want us to take 100 photos, even though they may only look at four or five of them. When you’re up on a roof and it’s 95 degrees and they want a picture of every single panel—it gets to be very tedious. Our crews just resent it.” Right now, the world wants to go solar—but the Trump administration is bucking that trend. A few weeks before the November election, Trump declared that solar was “all steel and glass and wires and looks like hell.” (Somewhat mystifyingly, he added, “And you see rabbits, they get caught in it.”) One possibility is that America will simply sit out the global solar boom in the same way Cubans, thanks to endless embargoes, still drive ’57 Chevys. Perhaps, having self-embargoed from the clean energy future, America will someday be a living museum of coal-fired power plants and basement furnaces. If we aren’t going to be left behind, we’re going to have to push. Engineers and scientists have done their job, dropping the price of clean energy 90 percent in a decade. Now environmentalists, entrepreneurs, YIMBYs, advocates for clean air, and local communities have our own job to do: convincing everyone else that rooftop solar is no longer “alternative” energy. As costs have plummeted, solar has gone from being the Whole Foods of energy to the Costco of power—available in bulk, on the shelf, and cheap in most of the world. If you’re feeling helpless against the administration’s attacks on the environment, you might want to join a big fall day of action, Sun Day, which will celebrate clean power, and push for solutions like SolarAPP+. We need to take on utilities, shake up the public utility commissions, and start to get Congress back on the side of the future. I’m hoping that a nationwide celebration of clean energy might prompt the same kind of momentum we’ve seen from housing advocates over the last few years, who’ve made headway pushing for zoning codes to finally be reformed. “We’ve got the hardware solved,” says OpenSolar’s Andrew Birch. “We’ve got the sunshine.

Title: Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop ‘Can Be A Tough Place To Work,’ But Its Vision Is Clear, A New Biography Claims: ‘It’s All About Gwyneth’

ByRachel Burchfield ByRachel Burchfield, Contributor. Love her or hate her—when it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, it’s difficult to look away. This has led to the popularity of Paltrow’s lifestyle brand, Goop, since its creation in 2008 as a newsletter written from her kitchen table—and that public fascination has now led to the writing of journalist Amy Odell’s new book Gwyneth: The Biography, out July 29. Odell tells me over Zoom that she spent three years interviewing more than 220 people who knew Paltrow at different stages of her life—ranging from friends to those who worked with her on movie sets to those who worked with her at Goop—“and I wanted to pull back the curtain on how she became so famous and so polarizing,” she says. “She’s someone people are magnetically attracted to, but she’s also been super controversial, and that’s what I think the book does, is really tell that story and also explain how she impacted various industries—entertainment, obviously, but also fashion, beauty and, perhaps most significantly, wellness.” All of Paltrow’s life experiences—from being a 1990s “It Girl” and winning the Academy Award for Best Actress at just 26 years old to being raised as the privileged daughter of Bruce Paltrow and Blythe Danner (as Odell reminds me, “I mean, Steven Spielberg is her godfather”) and so much in between—led to the creation of Goop 17 years ago and its trajectory ever since. While Odell’s book covers so much more than Goop—from her high-profile relationships to her childhood to her acting career—it also leans heavily into Paltrow as an entrepreneur. “She seems really ambitious,” Odell tells me. “She obviously juggles a lot of things capably.” She’s authentic, she adds, and “was never shy about just being who she is. This is all she knows. So I think that really works in her favor.” It’s nearly impossible to separate Paltrow the businesswoman from Paltrow the woman, and Gwyneth paints a holistic portrait of the 52-year-old’s life. Of Goop, Odell says, “Gwyneth made it very appealing through her taste—her really good taste—and she made it a world that people wanted to be a part of.” At the office, Paltrow is known mostly as “GP”; she often rolls up to the Goop offices—wearing, of course, Goop’s G. Label clothing line—and parks her white Range Rover in a spot labeled “Reserved for G-Spot.” As a boss, “Some people find it to be quite challenging,” Odell says of Paltrow. “But I think the good thing about working for her is that her vision is very clear. She has this extraordinary taste—a really sophisticated aesthetic and aspirational aesthetic that she brought to the wellness industry. I think that’s, in part, what made Goop and Goop’s wellness content so appealing. It was this gorgeous, aspirational aesthetic she brought to it.” Right down to the company’s name, Paltrow is in the midst of it—Goop was chosen as a moniker because of Paltrow’s initials, GP, and the perceived fact that companies with double Os—think Google or Yahoo!—did well. According to Odell’s book, Paltrow initially thought the name was “stupid and funny,” and she has also said in the past that Goop was “an old nickname” (her father, Bruce, apparently used to call her “Goopie”). True to Paltrow’s authentic nature, two Miramax executives told Odell that they remembered Paltrow using a Goop@aol.com email address back in the 1990s. She is who she is. As a boss—Paltrow has served as CEO of Goop since 2016, eight years after founding it—she has “very strong ideas and a very clear vision,” Odell says. “The problem is, she wanted to do everything, and she wanted to do it all perfectly.” Paltrow, known as a perfectionist, has also seen Goop spread itself rather thin—from beauty to fashion to wellness to food to newsletters to podcasts to Netflix shows, there are few verticals that the company hasn’t touched. “So people felt overworked, and there wasn’t a lot of money for everything they were doing—some people felt like they didn’t have enough budget for freelancers and things like that,” Odell says. “So there’s a lot of work to be done, and there’s this perfectionism that she wants to achieve. So people felt pressure from that.” If you walk into Paltrow’s office, she wants you to get directly to the point, Odell says, and “then you could just go.” When Paltrow shines her light on someone, “it feels amazing and people really thrive, but there’s a fear that it’s going to be taken away,” Odell tells me. If it does get taken away, in comes the stress, and “that stress could just permeate the office environment.” Some, Odell says, called Paltrow “icy and cold and aloof,” drawing comparisons to Vogue’s departing editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, whom Odell also profiled in a 2022 biography. “I think it can be a tough place to work,” Odell says. “That said—[it’s] not for everybody. Some people found it to be really tough. Some people ignored the chaos and were fine, and people said they liked that the vision was very clear, which was that it’s Gwyneth. It’s all about Gwyneth.” Much like when Paltrow shines her light on an employee and they feel her warmth, so it is when Paltrow promotes Goop’s products—that’s when they do the best. “They do sell,” Odell says. “People want to buy what she’s wearing. She looks great in the clothes, and she looks great wearing the mascara. So she’s very powerful in that way. But what if she gets tired of it? People tell me she doesn’t love doing the social media content—not that I can blame her. She’s got a lot on her plate.” Goop came about when Paltrow was living in London with her ex-husband Chris Martin and their two young kids: Apple, born in 2004, and Moses, born in 2006. After becoming a mother, Paltrow dialed back her work as an actress, which seems to be revving up again after both kids have now gone away to college. That leaves questions about the future of Goop—after all, what is Goop without Paltrow? “I’m not saying Gwyneth is not there for the company, but if she changes her mind—so the investors I spoke to, they did not see a super bright future for Goop, I have to say,” Odell says. Before Goop, Paltrow threw her star power behind brands like American Express and Estée Lauder before she realized, “Hey, why am I using my image to promote these other brands when I can use it to build my own brand?” Odell says of Paltrow’s possible thought patterns during that time period. “Which is incredibly savvy. And I think, in that way, she’s like the original influencer, because she realized that she could use her image to drive purchases, and she did really early affiliate deals before anyone was calling them affiliate deals, and now affiliate deals are this huge industry.” “I think she’s been so strategic,” Odell tells me. Since its newsletter origins, it has focused on the aforementioned beauty (Goop Beauty and Good Clean Goop), fashion (G. Label), wellness (Goop Wellness) and food (Goop Kitchen) verticals; it has had a Netflix series, a podcast, dipped its toe into home furnishings and courted controversy for its perceived pseudoscience and boundary-pushing products, like a viral candle advertised as smelling like Paltrow’s orgasm. Many people told Odell that Goop has spread itself too thin, “that they did too much,” she says. “They raised a lot of money, too. One expert I talked to said they probably never should have raised that much money.” Odell’s many interviews led her to believe that “they can keep going probably for a very long time, just as they are today,” she says. “I think it’s probably really up to Gwyneth—do I want to keep doing this? Do I want to have a little bit more flexibility and maybe license more of this business? I think it’s really up to her.” In September 2024, Goop let go 18 percent of its staff—affecting about 40 people—followed by a second round of layoffs last November. The goal of the reduction is to “optimize operational efficiency and revenue growth in our key verticals of beauty and fashion,” a Goop spokesperson told Business Insider. The spokesperson declined to provide specific revenue figures, but said revenue grew year-over-year in 2023 and was on track to grow again in 2024. While the spokesperson declined to say if Goop—a privately-held company—is profitable, Business Insider did report in November that Goop Beauty revenue was up 21 percent over the year prior, and the fashion brand G. Label was up 45 percent. The outlet reported that Goop has raised more than $140 million and was most recently valued at $433 million (per PitchBook); last fall, Paltrow told WWD that, after the first round of layoffs, Goop was “back in growth mode.” “What I’m most excited about is the refining of the brand that we’re doing—our hyperfocus on beauty, fashion and food,” Paltrow told Fortune in March. “Those are the verticals where we’re seeing incredible product-market fit and margin. Food, beauty and G. Label all grew exponentially last year. Since COVID, we’ve had to stay so agile, and getting to the other side of that and focusing on our strengths—there’s power in that.” Paltrow called layoffs “painful” and told the publication that “it’s always a very difficult thing to do, but sometimes for the rigor of the business, it’s necessary.” “I hate doing that more than anything in the world,” she continued, adding that Goop was “very, very close” to being profitable, “which is incredibly exciting, and a big milestone.” Not bad for a newsletter sharing recipes and recommendations with no monetization strategy in place in the company’s early days. Back then, Odell writes, “the whole spectacle of Goop was just plain entertaining, like a very curated look into her life.” Speaking of a look into her life—and into Paltrow’s influence—after she announced in 2014 that she and Martin were separating after 10 years of marriage, famously calling it a “conscious uncoupling,” Goop.com “received so much traffic, the site crashed,” Odell writes. As the company monetized and got into e-commerce, “I didn’t understand anything,” Paltrow said, as quoted in Gwyneth. “I didn’t finish college. I didn’t go to business school. I didn’t go up through a corporate environment.” Going forward, as Paltrow said herself, Goop’s strategy is to niche down on beauty, fashion and food: “The best thing to do is just embrace your niche, and scale can come from that,” Paltrow said at the 2024 Forbes Power Women’s Summit. “A lot of mistakes have come from me not understanding that.” “We have a lot of intention around what we’re doing, and I’m proud that we’re still alive and kicking,” she added. If Goop could go back in time, it should have done this from the start, Odell tells me. “People I talked to said she might’ve been better off just trying to prove one vertical first—just do beauty and kill it in beauty, and then maybe you iterate from there,” she says, citing Kim Kardashian’s Skims and its commitment to shapewear as an example. While Skims was founded by Kardashian, it’s not all about Kardashian, “and that makes you stronger, I think, as a celebrity brand,” Odell says. With Goop, “I think what happened there—this is my informed view on it—is that they built out all those different businesses, the clothing, the beauty, the events, all of that,” Odell says. “And they just grew too big. It was just too expensive to do all of that, a lot to build out a staff, to do a beauty line, to do a clothing line, a staff to do content. So they cut back because they needed to. The expenses were just too high.” As Odell writes in Gwyneth, “Not only was the pace and breadth of work unsustainable for employees, it would also prove unsustainable for Goop.” “[But] they’re still there and the company’s still going,” Odell tells me. “And Gwyneth is still the CEO.” These days, Odell was told the Goop Kitchen is the company’s biggest moneymaker—hence food making the cut alongside beauty and fashion as the path forward. When asked about a possible exit someday, Paltrow told Fortune, “I’m in building mode and not thinking about an exit right now. I don’t even really want to think about it for another three years, or even start thinking about it.” It remains uncertain what will come of Goop, but what Odell knows? “Whatever happens with Goop, Gwyneth will be fine,” she writes in the book. “She has a way of emerging victorious from any calamity.” Goop’s success, in large part, boils down to Paltrow and the public’s inability to take its eyes off her, a woman who Odell writes possesses “an enduring level of status and fascination few ever achieve.” “Goop was a window into a certain elitism,” she continues in the book. “And people couldn’t look away.” To a degree, they still can’t.

Title: As if the trade war never happened, stocks could pull off a feat not seen since the late-1990s boom

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The stock market has been on a hot streak lately, notching record high after record high, and some bulls on Wall Street think the party isn’t over. That marks a stunning reversal from the panic that gripped investors in April, when President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs shocked the world. Stocks, Treasury bonds, and the dollar crashed. Markets started pricing in a recession, and analysts slashed their forecasts. But Trump put his most aggressive tariff rates on hold, corporate earnings remained robust, consumers stayed resilient, and stocks rebounded. Even foreign investors jumped back into U.S. markets. Meanwhile, his administration has negotiated several trade deals, including one with the European Union on Sunday that removes the threat of a damaging trade war. Now that the fog of war is lifting, upbeat forecasts that predated Liberation Day are back, meaning stocks could put up big numbers again—as if the tariff shock from a few months ago was all just a bad dream. On Monday, Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus hiked his S&P 500 price target for this year to 7,100 from 5,950, reinstating the outlook he initially made in December 2024. “This year reminds us of the classic Charles Dickens quote, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,'” he said in his latest note. “Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes at least for now.” He cited progress on trade negotiations, strong corporate earnings, and the Federal Reserve’s deft handling of monetary policy, which cooled inflation without causing a recession. If the S&P 500 hits 7,100 this year, it would represent a gain of about 21% for 2025, marking a third straight year with a surge of more than 20%. That hasn’t happened since the late 1990s, when the U.S. economy and the stock market boomed. Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson said the S&P 500 could reach 7,200 by mid-2026, explaining that he is starting to lean closer to that more optimistic “bull case” scenario. He cited strong earnings as well as AI adoption, the weak dollar, Trump’s tax cuts, pent-up demand, and expectations for Fed rate cuts in early 2026. Another member of the 7,000 club is Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo Securities’ head of equity strategy, who has stuck by his S&P 500 forecast of 7,007 even during the trade war. Last week, he reaffirmed it, predicting big tech companies will continue fueling the stock market’s rally despite Trump’s trade policies. “What we’re seeing is the winners continue to win,” he told Bloomberg. “The uber-cap companies have the higher margins, are gaining more market share. There is a real secular trend in AI that will continue.” And over the longer term, this decade still looks like it will be another “roaring 20s,” according to market veteran Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. On Monday, he backed his thesis, which he first posited in August 2020, as productivity advances, a wave of capital outlays, and the endurance of consumer spending will keep stocks buoyant. “If the remainder of the decade continues to play out as the Roaring 2020s, we predict that the S&P 500 will start the next decade at 10,000,” Yardeni wrote in a note. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: Watch These Microsoft Stock Price Levels as Tech Giant Set to Report Earnings

Microsoft (MSFT) shares fell slightly on Monday but remain near a record high as investors await the scheduled release of the company's quarterly results on Wednesday. Just as with other Magnificent Seven companies, investors will be seeking updates on the tech giant’s spending plans as the AI arms race among tech rivals intensifies. Last week, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) lifted its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion, up from its prior forecast of $75 billion. Microsoft shares slipped 0.2% to close Monday's session at $512.50. The stock has gained nearly 22% since the start of the year, boosted by strong growth in the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment and successful efforts to integrate AI into its Copilot chatbot and Azure cloud platform. Below, we break down the technicals on Microsoft’s chart and point out price levels worth watching out for. Since gapping decisively above the 200-day moving average (MA) in early May, Microsoft shares have trended steadily higher within as ascending channel. During this time, the 50-day MA crossed above the 200-day MA to form a bullish golden cross, while the relative strength index has remained near overbought territory to signal strong price momentum. It’s also worth noting that volatility has fallen sharply in the stock since it bottomed in early April as shown by the average true range percent indicator—a technical tool that signals how much an asset typically moves as a percentage of its price. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast a potential upside target on Microsoft’s chart if the shares continue trending higher and also identify crucial support levels worth monitoring during future pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast a potential upside target in the stock by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis to Microsoft’s chart, we calculate the height of the ascending channel from its low to high rounded to the nearest dollar and add that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline. For instance, we add $93 to $527, which projects a target of $620, about 21% above today's closing price. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should watch for a retest of crucial support around $468. This area on the chart may attract buying interest near last year’s prominent July swing high. Finally, a decisive close below this level could see Microsoft shares drop to $430. This location finds a confluence of support from the closely watched 200-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a series of corresponding price action on the chart extending back to March last year.

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: Supermicro, Nike Shares Rise; Albemarle Stock Falls

Major U.S. equities indexes finished Monday mixed following the weekend announcement of a trade agreement with the European Union. The new trading week promises plenty of economic and financial news, including the Federal Reserve's interest-rate announcement, the latest jobs and inflation data, and a flood of earnings reports from major companies in the tech sector and beyond. The S&P 500 eked out a gain of less than 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3%. Both indexes were at record highs. The Dow slipped 0.1%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged more than 10%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance. Supermicro is set to release its quarterly results on Aug. 5. Monday's push higher for the stock followed reports that President Donald Trump has loosened restrictions on technological exports to China in a move to bolster trade negotiations with the country. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained 4.3%. According to reports, AMD raised pricing on its Instinct MI350 AI chip, suggesting the company is confident in the capacity of its high-end product to compete with offerings from rival Nvidia (NVDA). UBS analysts boosted their price target on AMD stock, pointing to improving expectations for the semiconductor maker's upcoming earnings report, slated for Aug. 5. Nike (NKE) shares treaded 3.9% higher Monday after JPMorgan upgraded the footwear and apparel maker's stock to "overweight" from "neutral." Analysts highlighted Nike's progress on its multiyear recovery plan, which includes inventory alignment and new performance products, with particular opportunities surrounding next year's soccer World Cup in the U.S. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, suffered the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock, dropping nearly 11%. With the move lower on Monday, Albemarle stock gave back the gains posted over the past week and a half after reports that a large lithium miner in China had suspended operations, helping alleviate concerns about oversupply in the market for the key battery component. Albemarle and other producers have been working to cut costs as they navigate a prolonged slump in lithium prices. Revvity (RVTY) shares fell 8.3% following the medical device maker's quarterly earnings release. Although second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share topped consensus estimates, the maker of instruments and reagents for drug discovery and other healthcare research lowered its full-year profit outlook, citing expected softness in its immunodiagnostics business in China. Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded Centene (CNC) stock to "neutral" from "overweight," and shares of the health insurer slipped 5.4%. Analysts pointed to headwinds related to Centene's business in the healthcare exchange and Medicaid markets. At the beginning of July, Centene withdrew its full-year guidance, citing cost and enrollment pressure.

Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gained 4.3%. According to reports, AMD raised pricing on its Instinct MI350 AI chip, suggesting the company is confident in the capacity of its high-end product to compete with offerings from rival Nvidia (NVDA). UBS analysts boosted their price target on AMD stock, pointing to improving expectations for the semiconductor maker's upcoming earnings report, slated for Aug. 5. Nike (NKE) shares treaded 3.9% higher Monday after JPMorgan upgraded the footwear and apparel maker's stock to "overweight" from "neutral." Analysts highlighted Nike's progress on its multiyear recovery plan, which includes inventory alignment and new performance products, with particular opportunities surrounding next year's soccer World Cup in the U.S. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, suffered the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock, dropping nearly 11%. With the move lower on Monday, Albemarle stock gave back the gains posted over the past week and a half after reports that a large lithium miner in China had suspended operations, helping alleviate concerns about oversupply in the market for the key battery component. Albemarle and other producers have been working to cut costs as they navigate a prolonged slump in lithium prices. Revvity (RVTY) shares fell 8.3% following the medical device maker's quarterly earnings release. Although second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share topped consensus estimates, the maker of instruments and reagents for drug discovery and other healthcare research lowered its full-year profit outlook, citing expected softness in its immunodiagnostics business in China. Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded Centene (CNC) stock to "neutral" from "overweight," and shares of the health insurer slipped 5.4%. Analysts pointed to headwinds related to Centene's business in the healthcare exchange and Medicaid markets. At the beginning of July, Centene withdrew its full-year guidance, citing cost and enrollment pressure.

The mood on Wall Street feels a bit like discovering that nothing is broken after a hard fall. U.S. stocks are near record highs to start the week, reflecting optimism about a range of topics that investors have had to ponder. The European Union and the U.S. struck a deal over the weekend, easing corporate anxiety of a protracted trade war. With some of that uncertainty cleared, and earnings so far coming on strong, some analysts are sounding more upbeat than they have for a while. Oppenheimer on Monday lifted its year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 7100 from 5950, among the highest held by major Wall Street brokerage firms. The outlook—which brings its target back to where it was to start the year—implies upside of about 11% from Friday's close. Morgan Stanley said the probability of its bull case, which puts the S&P 500 at 7200 in the middle of 2026, was firming up. Numbers like those are a long way from the levels below 5000 seen in April after President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement spooked investors. The next few days will test that optimism. "Although much uncertainty and worry prevailed for some time both with trade policy and geopolitical events, and given the multitude of potential outcomes, we’d note that cooler heads prevailed — leading to positive outcomes, at least for now," Oppenheimer wrote. The Federal Open Market Committee's next decision on interest rates is due Wednesday, and Big Tech giants with a combined market capitalization of over $10 trillion are due to report earnings. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) will go on Wednesday, and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. The Fed is unlikely to surprise. The market has set about a 2% probability of a cut in the federal funds rate come July 30, according to CME FedWatch. Ed Yardeni and William Pesek of Yardeni Research believe rates will remain unchanged, they wrote Monday, though they expect Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-decision press conference to be "relatively dovish," raising the perceived odds of a September cut. (For now, they said, they're in the "none-and-done camp" for 2025.) S&P 500 companies on are track to report second-quarter year-over-year earnings growth of more than 6%, according to FactSet. The pressure is on the part of the Magnificent 7 posse reporting this week to surprise to the upside, either with their respective results or their outlooks, given how much weight they carry in the broad market index: Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia (NVDA) have accounted for almost half of the S&P 500's gain this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple has dragged. So far this reporting season, S&P 500 companies are showing "mixed results," per FactSet's John Butters. While the percentage of S&P companies surprising on the upside, 80%, is above five- and 10-year averages, the magnitude of those surprises remains below historical averages. "The capitulatory price action and EPS estimate cuts we saw in April of this year around Liberation Day represented the end of a rolling earnings recession that began in 2022," Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson wrote in a note published Monday. "Now, we appear to be transitioning to a rolling recovery backdrop," he said.

Title: Microsoft Stock Up More Than Amazon. Don’t Buy Into AI-Staff Cuts

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Companies touting AI-driven job cuts rarely see significant stock gains, with most performing only slightly better than the S&P 500.Only Microsoft has achieved market-beating returns by consistently exceeding expectations and leveraging AI for growth.True stock value comes from beating expectations and raising guidance, not just headcount reduction. Companies are bragging about their staff cuts even as they invest heavily in artificial intelligence, The Wall Street Journal reported. Only one company – Microsoft – could enjoy market-beating returns. A closer look at the eight companies highlighted – Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Loomis, Bank of America, Verizon, Amazon, Intel and Union Pacific – reveals an important insight for investors: On average, the companies have posted mediocre gains this year – up 9.3% compared to an 8.9% rise in the S&P 500 as of July 25, according to Google Finance. Here’s why you should think twice before investing in the shares of companies promoting their headcount reduction in the wake of AI deployments: Microsoft is the only one of the eight that beat and raised for the last four quarters. Since it is also getting growth from its AI investments, the company’s stock may be the only one of the eight likely to deliver above average investor returns. The average stock price increase of the companies touting their AI-driven job cuts is just slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s increase so far in 2025. Below are the companies along with their stock price change this year as of July 25 and what they have said about their job cuts: Job cut announcements rarely benefit investors. Moreover, such news tends to produce at most 2% stock price increases – if management convinces investors the layoffs are part of a broader AI strategy to enhance productivity. Even such modest bumps last one to three trading days, according to academic research such as Stock investors’ reaction to layoff announcements: A meta-analysis. Moreover, if the layoffs are seen as a reaction to weak demand or lack a clear efficiency narrative, returns are flat or negative, academic research suggests. So what makes investors better off? Stock prices tend to rise when companies beat investor expectations and raise their guidance. “Positive earnings surprises and upward guidance revisions typically lead to positive stock price reactions,” according to quantitative evidence from academic literature such as Warp Speed Price Moves: Jumps after Earnings Announcements. Microsoft has outperformed the other seven companies when it comes to beating revenue and earnings per share expectations and raising guidance ahead of investor views over the last four quarters. More specifically, Microsoft has surpassed investor revenue and EPS expectations in the most recent four quarters and provided positive guidance for the future – which in some cases exceeded consensus estimates. These results suggest Microsoft is monetizing its AI initiatives through growth in demand for its cloud services, according to the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call transcript. Amazon and Intel shares have fallen short of the S&P 500’s return over the last year. The shares of both companies took a beating because they did not consistently exceed investors’ revenue expectations and their guidance was disappointing. For instance, Amazon beat analysts’ EPS expectations each quarter but did not consistently exceed their revenue estimates. Moreover, investors have expressed concern over the e-commerce giant’s sometimes cautious guidance for future quarters, reported Yahoo! Finance. Intel suffered from slightly different problems. The chip giant consistently surpassed revenue estimates in the last four quarters but often missed EPS expectations and provided guidance for future quarters that often fallen short of investor expectations – indicating ongoing challenges in their turnaround strategy, noted Investing.com. Companies that tout their job cuts may repel top talent – which could slow their growth. So, consider investing in the ones that consistently beat expectations and raise guidance above consensus with help from AI investments that yield faster growth.

Time Published: 2025-07-28T18:38:50Z

‘Cloudalists’ and digital serfs: capitalism’s new disguise? Capitalism isn’t dead, though many are rushing to write its obituary. It’s alive and kicking, powered by AI, vast data centres – and multi-billion dollar infrastructure investment. From Paris to Madrid, Rome to Berlin, a medieval spectre haunts the European left, and it’s wearing a Silicon Valley hoodie – ‘techno-feudalism’. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, de facto leader of French leftwing party La France Insoumise, has called for a tax on the profits of what he calls our new ‘digital lords’. Yet the same Mélenchon also tweets that ‘AI is not external to capitalist reality: it inscribes itself in a techno-feudalism where a few actors capture the rent.’ Profits or rent? Capitalism or feudalism? Like some stray Schrödinger’s Cat wandering the streets of Palo Alto, Mélenchon’s economy exists in two states simultaneously – dead and alive, capitalist and feudal, depending on which rhetorical convenience opens the box. In Spain, deputy prime minister Yolanda Díaz rails against ‘the techno-feudalism of magnate Elon Musk’, warning that tech billionaires want to transform ‘democracies into corporate monarchies’. Italy’s Green leader Angelo Bonelli accuses that same billionaire of erecting ‘an autocratic neo-feudalism’, urging the country to choose ‘Musk or democracy’. This outbreak of techno-feudal theatrics is hilariously mistimed, arriving in the middle of the most obscene, AI-fuelled capitalist orgy since the Gilded Age. During Trump’s Gulf tour in May 2025, he secured massive US-bound investments – Saudi Arabia committed $600bn, Qatar $1.2tn and the UAE $1.4tn, with much of it (if it ever materialises) earmarked for AI infrastructure. (This is on top of $1tn Japan promised back in February.) When OpenAI’s Sam Altman floated his $7tn fundraising fantasy last year, it felt like performance art. Now it looks more like a distinct lack of ambition. This AI spending tsunami has engulfed all of Big Tech: Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon alone are injecting $320bn into AI infrastructure in 2025, up from $246bn last year. Oracle signed $48bn in new contracts in a single quarter.

Title: Elon Musk is going founder mode on Tesla's $16.5 billion chip deal with Samsung

Time Published: 2025-07-28T17:26:29Z
Full Content:
Two particular lines in Elon Musk's posts about Tesla's new chip deal highlight just how far his "founder mode" approach extends. In this case, right down to his stated terms of Tesla's manufacturing agreement with Samsung. In a $16.5 billion deal, Samsung will produce Tesla's new AI6 chip from the manufacturing plant it is building in Taylor, Texas, which is expected to open in 2026. Located outside of Austin, Samsung's plant is close to where Musk moved in 2020, and where his company Tesla later moved in 2021. In an X post, Musk wrote that he would personally monitor the plant's activity. "This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress," Musk wrote. "And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house." In other words — "founder mode." Musk also wrote that Samsung "agreed to allow Tesla to assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency." The Tesla CEO wrote that the deal, which Bloomberg first reported, was one of "strategic importance" for the automaker. Neither Tesla nor Samsung responded to a request for comment. Musk has long been known for taking a founder-mode approach to running his companies, an in-the-details entrepreneurial mindset that has flourished in Silicon Valley. He famously slept on the factory floor during Tesla's Model 3. He personally renamed and reorganized an entire company when taking over Twitter, now X, and he set up shop in D.C. during his DOGE era. The term "founder mode" itself, though, is newer. Its origins stem from a 2024 talk that Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky gave for the startup accelerator Y Combinator. In it, he advised against the common principle that leaders of large-scale companies should hire good employees and give them space to do their job. In a September essay titled "Founder Mode," YC cofounder Paul Graham reflected on Chesky's talk, writing that there are "things founders can do that managers can't." Graham coined the term "founder mode," describing leaders of big companies who work on the ground across the company, delving into the details at a granular level, and not just via their direct reports. Chesky later embraced the mantra named after his talk, along with much of Silicon Valley. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote on X that "we need founder mode companies in all industries." In his essay, Graham thanked a variety of tech leaders for reading early drafts, including YC CEO Garry Tan, venture capitalist Ron Conway, and Musk himself. While the terms Musk describes for Tesla's manufacturing deal and his plans to personally walk the Samsung assembly line are very "founder mode," he's not the only CEO keeping a close eye on a company's supply chain. Tim Cook rose through the ranks at Apple before becoming CEO by closely managing Apple's supply chain. The iPhone giant famously keeps a very close eye on its manufacturing partners, many of which are in China. A United airport sign photographed in 2019 and confirmed to be legitimate by the airline revealed that Apple was buying 50 business class seats a day for its employees to travel from San Francisco to Shanghai, a travel hub connecting to Zhengzhou and Shenzhen, which have been called "iPhone cities." The iPhone maker is also known for having a broad team of operations overseers. Samsung's new chip deal with Tesla marks a major win for its foundry business. As of 1 p.m. in New York, the company's stock price was up 6.8%. And while Tesla's assembly line workers have experienced Elon Musk's founder mode approach, it sounds like soon Samsung's will too.

July 28, 2025 10:20 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, July 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: Will AGI Take Nvidia Stock To $300?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/28/will-agi-take-nvidia-stock-to-300/
Time Published: 2025-07-28T13:14:01Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Could Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) reach $300 in the next two years? There’s a strong possibility. How? Consider this, just about three months ago, at the end of April 2025, Nvidia stock was trading at around $95 levels and presently trades at close to $174 per share. The stock is also up roughly 4x over the past two years. Let’s look at valuations. Nvidia stock trades at about 40x consensus FY’26 earnings. Is this pricey?Not really. Especially if you consider the company's steadily expanding earnings, the long-growth runway for the artificial intelligence market, and Nvidia's formidable lead in the accelerated computing market. And if AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) becomes even partially realized over the next few years, the demand for high-performance computing could soar exponentially. In the scenario below, we use Nvidia's revenues, profitability, and valuation multiples to demonstrate a potential path to a $300 stock price. More Demanding Workloads, AGI Can Drive Revenue Nvidia's revenues grew by almost 2x over the last 12 months, while posting an average annual growth rate of about 69% over the last three years, and the momentum can hold up. If Nvidia grows its sales at an average annual rate of over 60% for the next two years - its revenues could move from around $131 billion in FY'25 to around $334 billion by FY'27 or over 2.5x. There are several trends that could drive continued growth. While the initial AI models deployed by the likes of OpenAI in 2022 were largely text-based, models are increasingly multimodal, working with speech, images, video, and 3D calling for higher computing power and a larger number of GPU shipments. Besides this, Nvidia recently indicated that it received assurances from the Trump administration allowing it to resume sales of its H20 artificial-intelligence chip to China after facing a ban around April. This marks a significant win for the company, as it preserves access to a major and fast-growing AI market. More importantly, AI is expected to evolve from its current form - writing text, generating images - to more general intelligence. While the timeline is not certain, the goal is to get AI to reason, plan, learn new tasks without retraining. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could conduct scientific research, generate novel insights, or design entire products on its own. This could unlock breakthroughs and innovations across industries and some models suggest this could push global GDP growth from low single digits to over 20% annually. ((The Economist)) As the world moves closer to AGI, Nvidia could stands to benefit enormously. AGI systems are expected to require massive computational resources to train and run, considerably exceeding today’s models, and Nvidia’s GPUs are currently the industry standard for powering such workloads. AGI could not just be the next industrial revolution, it could be much bigger and Nvidia’s chips could be right at the heart of it. Now the stock markets are often myopic and tend to extrapolate short-term trends for the long run. In Nvidia’s case, the assumption is that demand growth and pricing power will hold up and profits will remain sizable as the generative AI wave advances. However, there are multiple risks and there remains a real possibility that the stock could see a sizable correction. We detail this possibility in our analysis of Nvidia Stock To Crash In 2025? Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. Net Margins Will Remain Thick Combine this solid revenue growth with the fact that Nvidia's margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) are on an improving trajectory - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY'19 to over 51% in FY'25 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Software-related sales are also trending higher. We can assume that margins will remain flat at current levels as Nvidia's launch of pricier higher-end products such as the latest Blackwell chips are offset by potentially higher costs and competition in the lower-end of the market from the likes of AMD. With margins remaining flat and revenue rising 2.5x, we could see earnings rise 2.5x. Looking for an alternative AI play: Could AI contender AMD see a lift ahead of earnings? Strong Results Could Mean Earnings Multiples Hold Up Now, if earnings grow 2.5x, the PE multiple will shrink by 2.5x to levels of about 16x, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Nvidia investors are betting won’t happen. If earnings expand 2.5x over the next few years, instead of the PE shrinking from a figure around 40x now to about 16x, a scenario where the PE metric stays at about 28x looks quite likely. For perspective, Apple - a company that is growing at low single-digits - trades at 30x. This would make the growth of Nvidia’s stock by 1.7x within the next two years or so a real possibility, translating into a price of over $300 per share. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three, as long as Nvidia is on this revenue expansion trajectory, with margins holding up, the stock price could respond similarly. While Nvidia stock could have massive upside, it comes with risks and considerable volatility. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Turning the Software Factory into an Intelligence Engine

DevOps.com Turning the Software Factory into an Intelligence Engine By: Alan Shimel on July 28, 2025 We may have just witnessed the closing of one of the most iconic chapters in modern tech. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently stated that the company is transforming from a “software factory” into an “intelligence engine.” This came on the heels of another round of layoffs — with now over 7% of Microsoft’s workforce having been laid off recently — even as the company continues to report strong earnings. The implications of Nadella’s statement are far more profound than just a catchy metaphor for AI adoption. This may be the official end of the era Marc Andreessen launched when he declared “software is eating the world” and anointed every company a “software company.” Well, here we are. The world has been thoroughly chewed up and digested by software. Mission accomplished. Now what? We’re entering a new epoch — one where the core differentiator isn’t your software, it’s your intelligence. Not just artificial intelligence, but your organization’s ability to harness data, interpret it in real time, and act — autonomously, contextually and continuously. The software itself, once the crown jewel of digital transformation, is on the verge of being commoditized by the very intelligence it enabled. Why? Because increasingly, AI is writing the software. GitHub Copilot. Google Gemini Code Assist. Meta’s Code Llama. Even legacy enterprise players are integrating generative AI tooling to auto-generate workflows, scripts, tests and documentation. When AI can write, test, optimize and deploy software faster and better than a team of engineers, you start to ask: Is the code really the product, or is the intelligence behind it what actually matters? The answer is becoming clear. Software is no longer the endgame — it’s the delivery vehicle for intelligence. This transformation won’t just tweak job descriptions or shift a few budget lines. It’s going to shake corporate foundations like a 9.0 mega-quake. If your business model depends on proprietary code, you’re in trouble. If your engineering team is still grinding through feature requests by hand while your competitor has deployed autonomous agents to build, test and launch new capabilities in hours — game over. For large enterprises, the shift to intelligence engines means reorganizing around knowledge, not departments. Data pipelines will matter more than dev pipelines. Insight velocity will matter more than release velocity. The companies that succeed will be the ones that can build, refine, and deploy intelligence continuously — not just quarterly software updates. For SMBs, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. AI-enabled tools are leveling the playing field in a way we haven’t seen since the rise of cloud computing. A five-person startup can now compete with a Fortune 500 in terms of feature velocity, user experience and even customer support. Intelligence, not size, will be the ultimate force multiplier. And for the much-prophesied “one-person company” — yes, the age is dawning. With agentic AI handling coding, marketing, legal review, customer service and data analysis, a solopreneur can run a digitally native, globally available business without hiring a single employee. This isn’t just about flipping a switch or adding “AI” to your quarterly roadmap. Becoming an intelligence engine is a deliberate journey — and there are signs that mark the way: 1. Data-first mindset: Intelligence engines treat data as the core asset. They prioritize collecting high-quality, domain-specific data, and build the infrastructure to pipeline, label, refine and retrieve it for machine learning and decision automation. 2. Agentic workflows: Static automation is out. Dynamic, self-improving workflows powered by autonomous agents are in. These agents don’t just execute — they learn, adapt and optimize. 3. Continuous intelligence delivery: Think CI/CD, but for insights. Intelligence engines ship insights to decision-makers and operational systems on a real-time basis. 4. Synthetic workforce: Human labor is augmented—or even replaced—by synthetic workers: AI agents, copilots, bots and LLMs embedded into every facet of the business. 5. Organizational un-siloing: The intelligence engine operates horizontally across functions. Sales, marketing, ops and IT share a common data and intelligence backbone. Let’s be clear: software factories delivered immense value. But they were always limited by human throughput. Intelligence engines are unbounded by those constraints. An intelligence engine doesn’t just launch a product; it learns from the market response in real time and updates pricing, targeting, messaging, and UX on the fly. It doesn’t need a quarterly planning meeting to shift direction — it sees signals in the data and pivots autonomously. It doesn’t just automate workflows; it optimizes outcomes based on multidimensional, real-time feedback. The compounding advantage of this model is hard to overstate. Companies that reach intelligence engine status will move faster, serve smarter, and scale leaner than anything we’ve seen before. We’re already seeing the early adopters — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta — aligning their entire business models around intelligence-first infrastructure. But you don’t need hyperscaler resources to join the club. Thanks to open-source LLMs, accessible vector databases, and SaaS AI copilots, the tools are in reach for nearly everyone. The next 12–24 months will separate the true transformers from the late-stage digital dinosaurs. The tipping point will come when intelligence engines can fully replace not just manual workflows, but decision-making at scale. If you’re a technology leader, you need to ask yourself: Are we still building software factories when we should be engineering intelligence? This doesn’t mean gutting your dev team or replacing your engineers with bots overnight. But it does mean evolving your architecture, culture and processes to put intelligence — not just functionality — at the center of your strategy. At Techstrong, we’ll be watching this trend unfold across all our platforms — DevOps.com, Security Boulevard, Cloud Native Now, Platform Engineering,Digital CxO, and of course, Techstrong.ai. We’ll bring you the stories, strategies and signals of the companies making the leap from factory floor to intelligence engine. Software may have eaten the world — but intelligence is about to rewrite the recipe. Stay tuned.

Stock futures are pointing slightly higher after the U.S. and EU reach a trade deal; Samsung will produce AI chips for Tesla (TSLA) at a Texas facility in a $16.5 billion deal; Alibaba (BABA) unveils new AI glasses set to rival those from Meta Platforms (META); and Nike (NKE) shares are moving higher after JPMorgan upgrades the footwear maker's stock on momentum for global orders. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are moving higher as investors digest the latest trade deal between the U.S. and EU, which sent global stocks mostly higher. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are up 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, after the indexes ended last week at fresh all-time closing highs. Futures associated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average are 0.1% higher as the index hovers near its all-time high set last December. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is edging lower at just below $119,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is ticking higher. Oil futures are trading higher by more than 1%. Gold futures are little changed. The U.S. and the European Union reached a trade deal Sunday that will set a 15% tariff on goods from the 27-nation bloc, half the rate that was set to take effect Aug. 1. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the deal, which also includes an EU commitment to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest $600 billion more in the country than current levels. The EU will not charge a tariff on U.S. goods. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced in a post on his X network that Samsung Electronics will produce artificial intelligence semiconductors for the automaker in a new Texas facility. Samsung had disclosed the deal to make the AI6 chip for a "large global company" was worth more than $16.5 billion. Musk said that Samsung is currently making the AI4 chip for Tesla, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) will make the AI5. Tesla shares are moving nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. Alibaba (BABA) unveiled a pair of AI-powered smart glasses as the Chinese e-commerce giants seeks to compete with the likes of Meta Platforms (META) in the wearable devices market. Alibaba's Quark AI Glasses "support hands-free calling, music streaming, real-time language translation, and meeting transcription," the company said. Meta announced it would release AI-powered glasses this summer with sunglasses maker Oakley. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba are 1.5% higher in premarket trading. Nike (NKE) shares are about 4% higher in premarket trading after JPMorgan analysts upgraded the footwear maker's stock to "overweight" on momentum in global orders. JPMorgan also raised its earnings per share estimates for Nike's fiscal 2026 and 2027 for the first time since downgrading the stock to "neutral" in June 2024. Late last month, Nike stock soared after it beat fiscal fourth-quarter estimates amid CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround plan to return to sales growth.

Title: Somnath Mukherjee: Sebi’s Jane Street order was the canary our market needed

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Arbitrage or market manipulation? Jane Street believes it is an uber-efficient arbitrageur. It spotted pricing anomalies between index options and the index’s stock constituents, and used sophisticated trading models to profit from the arbitrage. The Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) order has some interesting findings. On 17 January 2024, the expiry day for Bank Nifty derivatives, the index opened 2% lower due to weak earnings of some of its constituents. However, options on the Bank Nifty traded at a level where the implied price was higher, resulting in an anomalous price spread. JS did what textbooks tell us: buy stocks that make up the Bank Nifty while selling options on this index. The trade worked as textbooks say it would: the spread narrowed within six minutes. But here’s the twist: the total value of Bank Nifty stocks purchased was ₹572 crore while the total notional value of the options sold was ₹8,751 crore, which is more than 15 times. This oddity continued. By mid-day, JS had bought Bank Nifty stocks and futures worth over ₹5,000 crore and sold options worth over ₹30,000 crore. Arbitrage is about hedging, but one doesn’t hedge a bet on India winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by placing 15 bets on India not-winning it. So JS started selling its stock/futures positions. But liquidity in these segments is so low that its trades tanked prices, resulting in losses for JS in its long index positions. But its large short options position (5-6 times in notional exposure to its cash/futures positions) got settled at market close at a massive profit. In short, JS appeared to move prices in the illiquid leg of the market (cash/futures) so that it could profit from its large position in the liquid leg (options). Also Read: Devina Mehra: How derivative dreams can turn into nightmares but still lure investors Arbitrage or manipulation? Either way, Sebi’s order has acted as the proverbial canary in the coal mine to reveal potentially poisonous fumes in our capital markets. Fume 1—Lopsided market structure: India’s equity market is the second largest among emerging economies by market capitalization and volumes both. However, volumes are skewed—over 90% are in derivatives (futures and options or F&O), with options accounting for the bulk. The cash segment is shallow. Daily volumes in the shares of HDFC Bank, the largest Bank Nifty constituent, for instance, are only about ₹2,000 crore. To put this in context, the total equity assets under management of India’s mutual funds (MFs) are over ₹30 trillion, with ₹50-60,000 crore worth of flows every month. This skew causes distortions. Also Read: Andy Mukherjee: Jane Street’s secret sauce for Indian markets should be tested out Fume 2—Skewed tax structure: A small ₹5,000 crore trade could move prices because there is no countervailing Indian entity that’s able to provide liquidity by playing the other side of JS’s ‘arbitrage’ trades. The reason is simple—tax rules. In India, the securities transaction tax (STT) on derivatives is a fraction of what it is on stocks, incentivizing investors to move to F&O from the cash segment. Further, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) enjoy a large tax advantage over Indians. FPIs’ F&O trades qualify for capital-gains tax (and are taxed at 20% if short-term and 12.5% if long-term), but for Indian entities, the same gains are deemed to be income (taxed at 25% for corporates and 39% for individuals/trusts). Fume 3—Regulation stifles Indian institutions: For many years, FPIs provided the dominant share of liquidity in Indian stock markets. Over the last decade, Indian institutions, especially MFs, have risen in stature and now account for a larger share of India’s market capitalization and volumes than FPIs. This provides a diversified pool of liquidity in the cash segment. But in the F&O segment, a regulatory overhang prevents the creation of such counterweight liquidity. Why? Also Read: Jane Street: Gaming an outdated system is not necessarily illegal in India First, domestic institutional investors are mostly not allowed to use leverage, but FPIs are. Second, short-selling, which lets market participants act on bearish views, exists mostly in the realm of theory; its process is such that participation and liquidity are low. Third, a prudential aversion to leverage has left F&O trading as its only source. Bank lending to capital markets is heavily circumscribed and non-banking financial companies have limited capacity to lend. This reduces domestic market liquidity and pushes participants towards the F&O segment. Fourth, while there are all sorts of limits in equity markets, index options face none. This means participants can build positions in index options many times the stock position limits on the underlying stocks. Fifth, a very high proportion of market liquidity is concentrated in short-term options contracts. India is unique as a large market with zero liquidity in derivatives of more than three months tenor. Also Read: Sebi’s Jane Street interim order made India’s stock market sit up for good reason Solutions are within grasp: India’s financial markets are world class. So are its regulators (think of Sebi and the Reserve Bank of India). Diversified liquidity is the lifeblood of any well-functioning market. Small tweaks in tax laws, alongside a rethink on the flexibility afforded to Indian institutions (especially MFs) would be a great fresh start. The appointment of market-makers for longer-dated derivatives is another idea that is well-tested in India; in the 1990s, RBI licensed a slew of primary dealers as market-makers for government bonds with great results. India’s capital markets are valuable. Sebi has done its bit as the canary by highlighting emergent risks. It is time now to make space for fresh ideas so that the mine continues to prosper for India.
