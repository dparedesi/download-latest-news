June 06, 2025 11:07 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members.

The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024.

(“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the “redetermination” process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

(NYSE:ELV), and Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages.

(NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA) Class Period: May 9, 2024 - May 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 14, 2025 According to the complaint, throughout the class period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Iovance's growth potential; notably, that it was not equipped to generate and drive demand or was otherwise ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported existing demand for its treatments through its network of approved treatment centers. On July 25, 2024, Iovance announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and reduced its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2024. The Company attributed its results and lowered guidance on 1) "the iCTC completed annual scheduled maintenance in December" and "capacity was reduced by more than half for about 1 month," 2) "[l]ower Proleukin sales" than the company expected, and 3) "the variable pace at which ATCs began treatment patients." Following this news, the price of Iovance's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $3.17 per share on May 8, 2025, Iovance's stock price fell to $1.75 per share on May 9, 2025, a decline of about 44.795% in the span of just a single day.
