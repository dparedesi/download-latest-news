Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV), a leading healthcare company offering a range of insurance and healthcare services, has recently faced challenges in its Medicaid business while maintaining growth potential in other segments. This comprehensive analysis examines the company's current position, recent financial performance, and future prospects in light of industry trends and competitive pressures. Elevance Health operates through various segments, including Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, and Other segments. The company has recently expanded its footprint through strategic acquisitions, including Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy, and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Specialty Pharmacy. These acquisitions have bolstered Elevance Health's position in the specialty pharmacy sector, a move that analysts view as potentially driving future growth. Elevance Health's recent financial performance has been marked by challenges, particularly in its Medicaid business. The company has lowered its earnings per share (EPS) guidance for 2024 and now expects mid-single-digit EPS growth in 2025, a significant decrease from its previous long-term growth target of over 12%. This adjustment has led to a decline in the company's share price and prompted analysts to revise their projections. Despite these challenges, some analysts maintain a positive outlook on Elevance Health's long-term prospects. The company's core commercial business remains strong, and there is potential for expansion in this segment. Additionally, Elevance Health's Carelon division is seen as having robust growth potential, which could help offset some of the pressures in other areas of the business. The primary source of Elevance Health's recent challenges lies in its Medicaid business. The company has experienced increased utilization in outpatient services, particularly in radiology and medical equipment. This trend, coupled with a timing mismatch between rates and acuity, has put pressure on Medicaid margins. Analysts expect these Medicaid-related headwinds to be temporary, with some projecting that margins will normalize by 2027. However, the near-term impact on earnings is significant, with new EPS guidance for 2024 set at $33, down by $4.20 from previous estimates. Elevance Health's management has indicated that they do not anticipate an acceleration of current Medicaid cost trends but expect them to sustain. The company's ability to manage these challenges and secure appropriate rate adjustments will be crucial for its performance in the coming years. While Medicaid has been a source of concern, Elevance Health's Medicare and commercial businesses have shown more stability. Medicare trends are reported to be in line with expectations, although there are some concerns about potential margin pressure in 2025 due to richer flex card benefits and the impact of the two-midnight rule on inpatient costs. The commercial business has demonstrated consistent trends with previous quarters, providing a steady foundation for the company. However, analysts note potential risks, including commercial risk spread compression and shifts in commercial risk from Administrative Services Only (ASO) arrangements. Elevance Health's Carelon division represents a significant opportunity for growth. The company is expected to drive upside through specialty sales in Blues networks, leveraging its recent acquisitions in the specialty pharmacy sector. Analysts view this expansion positively, seeing it as a key driver of future earnings growth and a potential offset to challenges in other segments. The managed care industry is facing several challenges and changes that impact Elevance Health and its competitors. Recent analysis of Medicare Advantage plans for 2025 indicates broad-based benefit cuts across the industry, which could affect customer satisfaction and retention. Elevance Health has made relatively modest cuts to its health plan benefits for 2025 compared to its peers, potentially positioning it favorably in terms of customer attraction and retention. However, elevated concerns about Stars ratings pose risks to companies' reputations and could potentially affect enrollment numbers. Additionally, the industry faces scrutiny, with a potential House investigation into PBM industry concentration adding regulatory uncertainty. Elevance Health's Medicaid business is currently facing significant headwinds due to increased utilization in outpatient services and a mismatch between rates and acuity. These challenges have already led to a reduction in EPS guidance for 2024 and lower growth expectations for 2025. If these issues persist longer than anticipated or if the company is unable to secure appropriate rate adjustments, it could result in prolonged margin pressure in the Medicaid segment. The company's profitability could be further impacted if state budgets tighten, leading to more aggressive rate negotiations or benefit reductions. Additionally, if the normalization of Medicaid margins takes longer than the projected timeline of 2027, it could lead to a sustained period of underperformance in this segment, potentially dragging down overall company profitability. While Elevance Health's Medicare business has been relatively stable, there are emerging risks that could impact its performance. One significant concern is the potential for margin pressure in 2025 due to richer flex card benefits. If competitors offer more attractive benefits, Elevance Health may need to follow suit to maintain market share, which could erode profitability. Another risk factor is the impact of the two-midnight rule on inpatient costs. If these costs continue to rise without corresponding reimbursement increases, it could squeeze Medicare margins. Additionally, there are concerns about potential adverse selection due to deep benefit cuts by competitors. If Elevance Health maintains more generous benefits while others cut back, it may attract higher-risk beneficiaries, potentially leading to increased medical costs and lower profitability in the Medicare segment. Elevance Health's diversified business model, encompassing commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, and specialty services, provides the company with multiple avenues for growth and recovery. While the Medicaid segment is currently facing challenges, the company's strong core commercial business and stable Medicare operations offer a solid foundation for overall performance. The Carelon division, in particular, represents a significant growth opportunity. With recent acquisitions in the specialty pharmacy sector, Elevance Health is well-positioned to expand its presence in this high-growth area. The potential for increased specialty sales through Blues networks could drive substantial revenue growth, helping to offset temporary setbacks in other segments. Furthermore, the company's diversification allows it to balance risks across different market segments. As Medicaid challenges are addressed and margins potentially normalize by 2027, growth in other areas of the business could help Elevance Health return to its long-term growth trajectory. Elevance Health's recent acquisitions of Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy, and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy have significantly bolstered its position in the specialty pharmacy sector. This strategic expansion presents several growth opportunities for the company. Firstly, the specialty pharmacy market is experiencing rapid growth due to the increasing prevalence of chronic and complex diseases requiring specialized medications. By strengthening its presence in this sector, Elevance Health can tap into this growing market, potentially driving significant revenue increases. Secondly, the integration of these specialty pharmacies with Elevance Health's existing health plans and provider networks could create synergies that improve patient care and reduce overall healthcare costs. This integrated approach could make Elevance Health more attractive to both individual consumers and employer groups seeking comprehensive healthcare solutions. Lastly, the expansion into specialty pharmacy aligns well with the company's Carelon division, which is already seen as a strong growth driver. The combination of Carelon's existing capabilities with the newly acquired specialty pharmacy assets could create a powerful platform for innovation in medication management and care coordination, potentially setting Elevance Health apart from its competitors in the managed care industry.

Title: What's Behind The 15% Fall For Elevance Health Stock?

GERMANY - 2024/02/15: In this photo illustration, Elevance Health, Inc. logo seen displayed on a ... [+] tablet. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovnov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) recently reported its Q3 results, with revenues exceeding but earnings missing the consensus estimates. The company reported revenue of $44.7 billion and adjusted earnings of $8.37 per share, compared to the street estimates of $43.5 billion and $9.66, respectively. Furthermore, the company cut its full-year earnings outlook. This did not sit well with the investors and the stock plunged 14% last week. Let's dive deeper into the company's performance and its impact on the stock. As an aside, big Tesla earnings this week - one outlier scenario - Can Trump Take Tesla to $0? How Did Elevance Health Perform In Q3? Elevance Health's revenue of $44.7 billion in Q3 reflects a 5.3% y-o-y growth, led by a solid 15% rise in Carelon sales. Carelon includes Carelon Rx and Carelon Services. The segment growth can be attributed to the Paragon Healthcare acquisition earlier this year. Elevance Healthcare's total Medicaid membership base shrunk by 1.5 million to 45.8 million in Q3, due to eligibility redeterminations. Roughly, 25 million people have been disenrolled from Medicaid since April 2023. During the pandemic phase, states kept people enrolled in Medicaid with the backing of federal funding. But this policy ended in March 2023, and the states had to renew eligibility for all Medicaid enrollees. ((KFF News Release, Sep 18, 2024)) This has led to a decline in the Medicaid membership base, including that of Elevance Health. The key metric which investors were eyeing was the benefit expense ratio, which came in at 89.5%, versus 86.8% in the prior-year quarter. The adjusted operating margin contracted 70 bps to 5.3%. The company reported adjusted earnings of $8.37 per share, as compared to $8.99 in the prior year quarter. Overall, Elevance Health's Q3 performance wasn't great, despite a top-line beat. Furthermore, investors weren't happy with the outlook for both 2024 and 2025. The company lowered its 2024 earnings outlook to $33 per share, versus its prior outlook of $37 per share. For 2025, the company expects only a mid-single-digit earnings growth, implying adjusted EPS of around $35, versus the consensus estimate of around $39. It appears that the medical costs aren't going to come down anytime soon, and this clubbed with a lower Medicaid base, may continue to weigh on Elevance Health's performance over the coming quarters. What Does This Mean For ELV Stock? It is evident from the decline in ELV stock that the investors weren't happy with the outlook. At its current levels of around $430, ELV stock is trading at 13x its 2024 expected earnings of around $33. The 13x figure compares with the stock's average P/E ratio of 14x seen over the last three years. A slight decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the bleak outlook for 2024 and 2025. ELV stock has underperformed the broader markets this year, with the stock down 8%, while the S&P 500 index is up 22%. Looking at a slightly longer term, the increase in ELV stock over the last three-year period has been far from consistent and has largely been as volatile as the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
