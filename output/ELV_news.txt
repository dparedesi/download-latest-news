U.S. health insurers experienced a challenging third quarter, reporting increased medical costs and significant policy-related pressures, which led to a notable decline in share prices across the sector. U.S. health insurance companies encountered substantial financial headwinds in the third quarter, reporting results marked by escalating medical costs and the looming impact of legislative changes. The sector's performance lagged the broader market, with several major players experiencing significant stock price depreciation. The third-quarter earnings season, which commenced on October 21, unveiled a consistent theme of increased cost pressures across the health insurance industry. A primary driver of these rising expenses has been the government-subsidized Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans, where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), the nation's largest insurer, specifically highlighted heightened acuity levels among its Medicaid enrollees following the resumption of state-led procedural disenrollment in March 2023. Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) reported a substantial $6.6 billion third-quarter loss, a stark contrast to its $713 million profit in the same period last year. This loss was largely attributed to escalating healthcare costs and a $6.7 billion non-cash goodwill impairment. The impairment was a consequence of a sustained decline in Centene's stock price throughout 2025 and the anticipated financial repercussions of the "One Big Beautiful Bill," which forecasts $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies over the next decade. Centene's health benefits ratio (HBR), the proportion of premiums spent on medical care, climbed to 92.7%, up from 89.2% a year prior, underscoring the rising cost burden. Market reactions to these results were swift and negative. Since October 20, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares fell 9.1%, UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) declined 5.4%, and The Cigna Group (CI) dropped 19.5%. The most pronounced decrease among major managed care insurers was recorded by Molina Healthcare, Inc. (MOH), which saw its stock price decrease by 23.5%. These declines surpassed those of the broader market, with the S&P 500 falling 2.47% and the S&P Insurance Index decreasing 2.15% over the same period. The adverse market reaction reflects investor concerns over several interconnected factors. Primarily, the rising medical expense ratios indicate a squeeze on profitability, particularly as insurers grapple with sicker patient populations in government-funded programs. The "One Big Beautiful Bill" has introduced significant political uncertainty and financial risk, with projections suggesting it could eliminate health coverage for nearly 12 million Americans. This directly impacts insurers like Centene, which manage Medicaid plans for over 12 million low-income individuals. Furthermore, issues are not confined solely to Medicaid. UnitedHealth also noted the expected impact of changes within the ACA markets. The company anticipates that rate increases exceeding 25% and targeted service area reductions could lead to a decrease of approximately two-thirds in its Obamacare customer base, potentially forcing over one million enrollees to seek alternative coverage. These aggressive actions, while aimed at improving margins in the employer and individual segment by 2026, suggest ongoing struggles to achieve targeted profitability levels. The sector's performance in the third quarter highlights a challenging operating environment exacerbated by both fundamental cost pressures and a shifting regulatory landscape. The substantial goodwill impairment reported by Centene underscores the market's re-evaluation of long-term prospects in light of evolving healthcare policy. The company's valuation review specifically cited the expected financial impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" as a key factor. The broader market implications are significant. As insurers face increased costs and legislative changes that could reduce their customer base and subsidies, the sustainability of current business models, particularly within government-sponsored programs, comes into question. The aggressive rate hikes by UnitedHealthcare in the ACA marketplace indicate an industry-wide effort to adapt to these new realities, potentially at the expense of market share. While specific analyst quotes were not provided in the briefing, the collective sentiment from company executives and market movements suggests a cautious outlook. UnitedHealthcare chief executive Tim Noel indicated that the company's submitted rate filings reflect the 2025 morbidity and experience, including average rate increases of over 25%, as a necessary measure to improve margins. The acknowledgment that these margins are still projected to remain below the targeted 7–9% range for 2026 further underscores the persistent challenges. Investors will closely monitor several key factors in the coming quarters. The full implementation and impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" and its projected cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will be a critical determinant for sector profitability. The ability of insurers to manage medical costs effectively, particularly within Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, will remain paramount. Furthermore, the strategies employed by major players like UnitedHealthcare to navigate the ACA landscape, including the potential for significant enrollee shifts, will provide insights into the sector's adaptability. The interplay of legislative policy, evolving patient demographics, and cost containment efforts will define the trajectory for U.S. health insurers in the near to medium term. ## Strive Outlines Preferred Stock Offering for Bitcoin Treasury Expansion U.S. equities saw a notable event on Monday, with **Strive Inc. (NASDAQ: ASST)** announcing plans for an initial public offering (IPO) of a new class of preferred shares. The proposed offering aims to raise capital primarily for the acquisition of additional **Bitcoin (BTC)**, marking a strategic move to expand the company's digital asset treasury. This development closely mirrors previous capital-raising efforts by firms like **Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR)**. ## Details of the Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock **Strive** intends to offer 1,250,000 shares of its **Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock**, designated as **SATA Stock**. Each **SATA** share will carry a stated amount of $100 and is designed to provide an initial annual dividend rate of 12.00%. These cumulative dividends are slated to be payable monthly in arrears, commencing on December 15, 2025. To underpin these dividend commitments, **Strive** plans to establish a dividend reserve amounting to $12.00 per share of **SATA Stock**, sufficient to cover the first 12 months of dividend payments at the initial rate. While **Strive** reserves the right to adjust the monthly regular dividend rate, its stated intention is to manage the rate to maintain the **SATA Stock** within a long-term trading range of $95 to $105 per share. The net proceeds from this offering are earmarked for general corporate purposes. The primary objective is the acquisition of **Bitcoin** and **Bitcoin**-related products. Funds may also be allocated for working capital, the purchase of income-generating assets, other capital expenditures, repurchases of the company's Class A common stock, and/or repayment of debt. As of October 27, 2025, **Strive** holds approximately 5,957.9 **Bitcoins**, valued at roughly $637 million. This figure could increase significantly, potentially to around 11,000 **Bitcoins**, should the company finalize its all-stock merger with **Semler Scientific (NASDAQ: SMLR)**. ## Market Context and Strategic Rationale The decision to issue preferred stock comes as **Strive's (ASST)** common stock has experienced considerable volatility. Following a recent SPAC deal and its pivot to a **Bitcoin**-focused asset manager, **ASST** shares have been trading at a discount to the underlying value of its **Bitcoin** holdings, reflected in a market value per share below the net asset value (mNAV below 1). In such a scenario, issuing additional common stock for **Bitcoin** purchases would be highly dilutive to existing shareholders. The preferred stock offering provides a non-dilutive capital-raising mechanism, allowing **Strive** to expand its **Bitcoin** treasury without further impacting common shareholder equity. On Monday, **ASST** shares declined by 2.3%, coinciding with a 4% slide in the price of **Bitcoin** to approximately $106,000. This reaction indicates that while the long-term strategy may be perceived positively, immediate market sentiment remains cautious, especially in a downward-trending **Bitcoin** environment. ## Precedent Set by Strategy's Diversified Capital Strategy **Strive's** approach draws a direct parallel to the capital-raising strategies employed by **Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy)**. **Strategy**, a pioneer in the corporate **Bitcoin** treasury model, has successfully utilized a mix of equity and various preferred stock offerings to finance its substantial **Bitcoin** acquisitions. For instance, **Strategy** has offered different classes of preferred shares, such as **STRK** (convertible with an 8% non-cumulative dividend), **STRF** (non-convertible with a 10% cumulative dividend), and **STRD** (non-convertible with a 10% non-cumulative dividend, featuring a higher risk-reward profile). These diverse instruments allow **Strategy** to appeal to different investor segments and broaden its access to capital for **Bitcoin** purchases. **Strategy's** expanded "42/42" capital raise plan, aiming for $84 billion through equity and convertible notes by 2027, underscores the scale and sophistication of such treasury strategies. The issuance of dividend-paying preferred stock linked to digital assets presents both opportunities and risks. For investors, it offers a potentially attractive income stream tied to the performance and accumulation strategy of a **Bitcoin** treasury company. However, the success of such an instrument is intrinsically linked to the stability and growth of **Bitcoin's** value, as well as the company's ability to sustain elevated dividend rates. Key risks include the potential for sustained cash dividends to underperform if trading or asset returns are weak, and the impact on liquidity from monthly cash obligations, particularly if dividends are compounded due to missed payments. ## Outlook and Key Considerations Looking ahead, the successful execution of **Strive's SATA** offering and its subsequent deployment of capital into **Bitcoin** will be closely monitored. The company's ability to maintain the **SATA Stock** price within its targeted range of $95-$105 per share through dividend rate adjustments will be a crucial indicator of investor confidence in the preferred shares. Investors will also be watching for developments in **Strive's** proposed merger with **Semler Scientific**, which could significantly augment its **Bitcoin** holdings. The broader market will continue to assess the viability and risks associated with "digital asset treasury" stocks. The performance of **Bitcoin** itself remains a fundamental driver for companies like **Strive** and **Strategy**. Upcoming economic reports, interest rate policy decisions, and overall sentiment in the cryptocurrency market will all play a role in shaping the trajectory of these specialized investment vehicles. ## PSEG Exceeds Q3 2025 Earnings Expectations, Narrows Guidance **Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG)** (**PEG**) announced strong financial results for the third quarter of 2025, reporting a net income of $1.24 per share, a significant increase from $1.04 per share in Q3 2024. This performance surpassed market expectations, which had forecasted an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03. The company's non-GAAP operating earnings also saw a notable rise, reaching $1.13 per share for Q3 2025, compared to $0.90 per share in the prior year period. This growth was primarily attributed to the implementation of new electric and gas base distribution rates, effective October 2024, and enhanced returns on capital investments. Following these results, **PSEG** has narrowed its full-year 2025 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance to the upper half of its previously stated range, now projecting $4.00 to $4.06 per share, an adjustment from the earlier $3.94 to $4.06 per share. ## Detailed Financial Performance and Capital Investments For the third quarter of 2025, **PSEG**'s net income stood at $622 million, compared to $520 million in Q3 2024. The corresponding non-GAAP operating earnings were $565 million. The substantial improvement reflects the full impact of the October 2024 rate case settlement and higher power pricing. The utility segment, **PSE&G**, specifically reported a net income of $515 million for Q3 2025, up from $379 million in Q3 2024. In terms of capital deployment, **PSEG** invested approximately $1 billion in regulated projects during Q3 2025, contributing to a total of $2.7 billion for the first nine months of the year. This aligns with its ambitious $3.8 billion full-year regulated capital plan. The company also reaffirmed its robust Five-Year Capital Investment Outlook, projecting expenditures between $22.5 billion and $26 billion for the period of 2025 through 2029, a plan that is expected to be executed without the need for new equity issuance or asset sales. ## Strategic Growth Drivers: Data Centers and Nuclear Energy A significant driver of **PSEG**'s strategic outlook is the accelerating demand from data centers and edge computing. The company reported a substantial increase in data center load pipeline inquiries, which have risen to 11.5 gigawatts, with nearly all of this demand attributed to data center requirements. Mature data center applications within **PSEG**'s service territory also grew from 2,600 megawatts to 2,800 megawatts, indicating ongoing incremental activity. Management highlighted the ongoing legislative and regulatory processes in New Jersey, particularly concerning generation adequacy, with load growth from data center projects emerging as a central business driver. **PSEG** is actively collaborating with policymakers to address resource adequacy, including supporting proposed legislation aimed at promoting competition for new in-state generation. Furthermore, the company detailed initiatives targeting operational improvements and capacity growth within its nuclear fleet, including a recent transition in **Hope Creek**'s nuclear refueling cycle and ongoing upgrades at **Salem**. These strategic focuses underpin **PSEG**'s reaffirmed long-term non-GAAP EPS growth target of 5%-7% compound annual growth through 2029, supported by its significant capital spending program and the nuclear Production Tax Credit (PTC) environment. ## Market Reaction and Broader Implications The strong Q3 2025 earnings and positive outlook for **PSEG** have generated a bullish sentiment around the company's stock. The results underscore the positive impact of regulated rate adjustments and strategic investments in critical infrastructure. For investors, **PSEG**'s performance signals the potential for stable returns within the utility sector, particularly as demand for reliable and robust power infrastructure grows to support energy-intensive industries like data centers. **PSEG**'s proactive engagement with policymakers to balance affordability and reliability, coupled with its substantial capital expenditure plan, positions it favorably within a sector facing increasing demands and evolving regulatory landscapes. The emphasis on nuclear power also highlights a broader industry trend towards diverse and carbon-free energy sources. ## Outlook and Key Factors to Monitor Looking ahead, **PSEG**'s reaffirmed long-term EPS growth target of 5%-7% through 2029 remains a key indicator for future performance. Investors will closely monitor the company's ability to execute its ambitious $22.5 billion to $26 billion capital investment plan effectively and without the need for additional equity. The trajectory of data center load growth and **PSEG**'s capacity to meet this escalating demand will be crucial for sustaining its growth momentum. Continued legislative and regulatory developments in New Jersey regarding generation adequacy will also be critical, particularly as the region grapples with a supply-demand imbalance that could impact reliability and affordability. **PSEG**'s efforts to contract its nuclear output under multi-year agreements and pursue additional utility investments to address growing customer demand will be important factors to watch in the coming quarters. ## The $6.5 Billion Investment in Detail **Apollo**-managed funds have reached an agreement to commit $6.5 billion for a 50% ownership stake in **Ørsted**'s **Hornsea 3** offshore wind project, located in the UK. This substantial investment includes both the acquisition price for the joint venture interest and a commitment to fund 50% of the project's remaining construction costs. The agreement stipulates an initial investment of approximately $3.25 billion by **Apollo** upon closing, with the remaining $3.25 billion to be funded as the project achieves specific construction and development milestones in the coming years. **Hornsea 3** is positioned as the world's largest offshore wind project, boasting a generating capacity of 2.9 gigawatts (GW). Upon completion, this capacity will be sufficient to provide low-cost, renewable electricity to more than 3 million UK households. Under the terms of the agreement, **Ørsted** will maintain its role in constructing the wind farm through a full-scope Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract. Furthermore, **Ørsted** will provide long-term operations and maintenance services, as well as managing the route-to-market for power generation. The senior financing for the project is being led by **Apollo**-managed entities, with banking facilities underwritten by a consortium of institutions including **BNP Paribas**, **ING Bank**, **Lloyds**, and **RBC Capital Markets**. Co-investors in the project include **La Caisse** (formerly **CDPQ**) and **PSP Investments**. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals and is projected to finalize before the close of 2025. ## Market Implications and Renewable Energy Expansion The commitment by **Apollo** to **Hornsea 3** signals strong investor confidence in large-scale **offshore wind** projects and the broader **renewable energy** sector. This investment provides crucial capital for a significant clean energy infrastructure project in the UK, a nation with ambitious decarbonization targets. For **Ørsted**, the partnership with **Apollo** enables it to de-risk its capital expenditure while retaining expertise in project development and operation. The influx of institutional capital into such substantial projects is indicative of the increasing financial viability and attractiveness of **renewable energy** assets for long-term investors seeking stable returns.

This move aligns with global trends of transitioning away from fossil fuels, where **offshore wind** is emerging as a critical component of national energy strategies. ## Broader Context: Apollo's Strategic Growth and Sector Trends This $6.5 billion investment is consistent with **Apollo Global Management, Inc.**'s (NYSE: **APO**) strategic focus on deploying capital into infrastructure and long-duration assets. The firm's second-quarter 2025 financial results reported on August 5, 2025, demonstrated robust growth, with total **Assets Under Management (AUM)** increasing by 21% year-over-year to $840 billion. **Fee-Generating AUM** also grew by 22% to $638 billion, driven by $61 billion in inflows during the quarter. This financial strength and capital-raising capability position **Apollo** to undertake significant investments like **Hornsea 3**. The firm's **Fee Related Earnings (FRE)** reached a record $627 million, a 21.5% increase year-over-year, complemented by **Spread Related Earnings (SRE)** of $821 million, totaling $1.4 billion for the quarter. These figures highlight **Apollo**'s capacity to execute complex, large-scale transactions and its diversified business model. From a broader market perspective, the **offshore wind** sector is attracting substantial investment due to its scalability, technological advancements, and supportive government policies. The UK, in particular, has been a leader in developing **offshore wind** capacity, making projects like **Hornsea 3** attractive to global investors seeking exposure to the energy transition. ## Industry Perspectives and Future Outlook Market analysts generally view **Apollo**'s investment in **Hornsea 3** as a positive development for both firms and the wider **renewable energy** infrastructure market. The partnership between a leading asset manager and a prominent **offshore wind** developer is expected to serve as a template for future large-scale **renewable energy** financing. The involvement of a diverse group of major banks and co-investors further validates the financial robustness and investment-grade nature of such projects. Looking ahead, the successful execution of **Hornsea 3** will likely encourage further institutional capital deployment into **offshore wind** and other **renewable energy** technologies. Investors will be closely watching the project's progress, regulatory approvals, and its eventual contribution to the UK's energy grid. This transaction reinforces the growing trend of private capital playing a pivotal role in accelerating the global **energy transition**, with a focus on delivering both environmental benefits and attractive long-term financial returns.
