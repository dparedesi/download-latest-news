(NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, May 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

May 28, 2025 09:11 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, May 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the “redetermination” process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

May 27, 2025 18:12 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, May 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024 and October 16, 2024. Elevance is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Elevance Health, Inc. (ELV) Failed to Disclose the Impact Medicaid Redetermination Would Have on its Business Prospects According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the Medicaid redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. Defendants further reassured investors that “we’re intentionally remaining thoughtful and prudent in our outlook,” and that, while the Company was seeing an acuity mix shift in the Medicaid business, it was “nothing outside of the bounds of what we’ve expected and guided for.” In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. On July 17, 2024, the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” In response to these disclosures, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, from a closing price of $553.14 on July 16, 2024, to a closing price of $520.93 on July 17, 2024. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Elevance Health, Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class are required to file their papers with the court by July 11, 2025. The lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses.
