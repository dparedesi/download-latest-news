(NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00.1.Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures.2.Earnings per diluted share ("EPS"). Elevance Health Consolidated Enterprise Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$44.7 $42.5 $43.2 Operating Gain1,2$1.4 $1.8 $2.8 Adjusted Operating Gain1,3$2.4 $2.5 $2.8 Operating Margin13.1 % 4.1 % 6.4 % Adjusted Operating Margin1,35.3 % 6.0 % 6.6 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.2.Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, include items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation."3.Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein.Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Health Benefits is comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard ®, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses. Health Benefits Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$38.3 $36.7 $37.2 Operating Gain1$1.6 $1.8 $2.1 Operating Margin14.2 % 5.0 % 5.8 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Health Benefits segment operating revenue was $38.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1$0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin15.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2024.

Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables.Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.Elevance HealthEarnings Release Financial Schedules and Supplementary InformationQuarter & Year-to-Date Ended September 30, 2024Membership and Other MetricsQuarterly & Year-to-Date Consolidated Statements of IncomeCondensed Consolidated Balance SheetCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsSupplemental Financial Information - Reportable SegmentsSupplemental Financial Information - Reconciliation of Medical Claims PayableReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresElevance HealthMembership and Other Metrics(Unaudited) Change fromMedical Membership (in thousands)September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024Individual1,299 999 1,281 30.0 % 1.4 %Employer Group Risk-Based3,672 3,754 3,648 (2.2) % 0.7 %Commercial Risk-Based4,971 4,753 4,929 4.6 % 0.9 %BlueCard ®16,677 6,737 6,692 (0.9) % (0.2) %Employer Group Fee-Based20,589 20,166 20,542 2.1 % 0.2 %Commercial Fee-Based27,266 26,903 27,234 1.3 % 0.1 %Medicare Advantage2,047 2,064 2,031 (0.8) % 0.8 %Medicare Supplement894 928 894 (3.7) % ” %Total Medicare2,941 2,992 2,925 (1.7) % 0.5 %Medicaid8,926 11,018 9,028 (19.0) % (1.1) %Federal Employees Health Benefits1,656 1,640 1,660 1.0 % (0.2) %Total Medical Membership45,760 47,306 45,776 (3.3) % ” %Other Membership (in thousands) Dental Members7,021 6,775 7,008 3.6 % 0.2 %Dental Administration Members1,878 1,708 1,851 10.0 % 1.5 %Vision Members10,382 9,861 10,275 5.3 % 1.0 %Medicare Part D Standalone Members258 261 260 (1.1) % (0.8) %Other Metrics (in millions) CarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts80.2 77.3 78.2 3.8 % 2.6 %Carelon Services Consumers Served101.3 104.8 102.3 (3.3) % (1.0) % 1.BlueCard ® membership for the three months ended September 30, 2023, is restated to align to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association reporting methodology.

(NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00.1.Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures.2.Earnings per diluted share ("EPS"). Elevance Health Consolidated Enterprise Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$44.7 $42.5 $43.2 Operating Gain1,2$1.4 $1.8 $2.8 Adjusted Operating Gain1,3$2.4 $2.5 $2.8 Operating Margin13.1 % 4.1 % 6.4 % Adjusted Operating Margin1,35.3 % 6.0 % 6.6 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.2.Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, include items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation."3.Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein.Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Health Benefits is comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard ®, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses. Health Benefits Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$38.3 $36.7 $37.2 Operating Gain1$1.6 $1.8 $2.1 Operating Margin14.2 % 5.0 % 5.8 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Health Benefits segment operating revenue was $38.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions)Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1$13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1$0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin15.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % 1.See Basis of Presentation herein.Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2024.

Basis of PresentationOperating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables.Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.Elevance HealthEarnings Release Financial Schedules and Supplementary InformationQuarter & Year-to-Date Ended September 30, 2024Membership and Other MetricsQuarterly & Year-to-Date Consolidated Statements of IncomeCondensed Consolidated Balance SheetCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsSupplemental Financial Information - Reportable SegmentsSupplemental Financial Information - Reconciliation of Medical Claims PayableReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresElevance HealthMembership and Other Metrics(Unaudited) Change fromMedical Membership (in thousands)September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024Individual1,299 999 1,281 30.0 % 1.4 %Employer Group Risk-Based3,672 3,754 3,648 (2.2) % 0.7 %Commercial Risk-Based4,971 4,753 4,929 4.6 % 0.9 %BlueCard ®16,677 6,737 6,692 (0.9) % (0.2) %Employer Group Fee-Based20,589 20,166 20,542 2.1 % 0.2 %Commercial Fee-Based27,266 26,903 27,234 1.3 % 0.1 %Medicare Advantage2,047 2,064 2,031 (0.8) % 0.8 %Medicare Supplement894 928 894 (3.7) % ” %Total Medicare2,941 2,992 2,925 (1.7) % 0.5 %Medicaid8,926 11,018 9,028 (19.0) % (1.1) %Federal Employees Health Benefits1,656 1,640 1,660 1.0 % (0.2) %Total Medical Membership45,760 47,306 45,776 (3.3) % ” %Other Membership (in thousands) Dental Members7,021 6,775 7,008 3.6 % 0.2 %Dental Administration Members1,878 1,708 1,851 10.0 % 1.5 %Vision Members10,382 9,861 10,275 5.3 % 1.0 %Medicare Part D Standalone Members258 261 260 (1.1) % (0.8) %Other Metrics (in millions) CarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts80.2 77.3 78.2 3.8 % 2.6 %Carelon Services Consumers Served101.3 104.8 102.3 (3.3) % (1.0) % 1.BlueCard ® membership for the three months ended September 30, 2023, is restated to align to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association reporting methodology.

These non-GAAP measures are intended to aid investors when comparing Elevance Health's financial results among periods and are not intended to be alternatives to any measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are available below. In addition to these non-GAAP measures, references are made to the measures Operating Revenue and Operating Gain/Loss, Operating Margin and Adjusted EPS. Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reportable segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Each of these measures is provided to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing Elevance Health's operating and financial results. A reconciliation of Operating Revenue to Total Revenue is set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income herein. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, together with a reconciliation of reportable segments operating gain to income before income tax expense, is provided below. Prior amounts may be grouped differently to conform to the current presentation. Net adjustment items per share may not sum due to rounding.

INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) reported third quarter 2024 results. We remain confident in the long-term earnings potential of our diverse businesses as we navigate a dynamic operating environment and unprecedented challenges in the Medicaid business. We expect Medicaid rates will align with the needs of our members in time, and are taking proactive actions to enhance operational efficiencies that will ensure we emerge from this period even stronger. Gail K. BoudreauxPresident and Chief Executive Officer Given third quarter results and the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and acuity, Elevance Health now expects 2024 GAAP net income per diluted share to be approximately $26.50 and adjusted net income per diluted share to be approximately $33.00. Refer to GAAP reconciliation tables herein for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted measures. Earnings per diluted share ("EPS"). Elevance Health Consolidated Enterprise Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $44.7 $42.5 $43.2 Operating Gain1,2 $1.4 $1.8 $2.8 Adjusted Operating Gain1,3 $2.4 $2.5 $2.8 Operating Margin1 3.1 % 4.1 % 6.4 % Adjusted Operating Margin1,3 5.3 % 6.0 % 6.6 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, include items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation." Adjusted Operating Gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, exclude items that are excluded from adjusted shareholders' net income. See "GAAP Reconciliation" herein. Operating revenue was $44.7 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher premium yields in our Health Benefits segment and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. The benefit expense ratio was 89.5 percent, an increase of 270 basis points, driven primarily by the timing mismatch between Medicaid rates and the higher acuity of our members. Days in Claims Payable was 42.8 days as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.5 days from June 30, 2024, and a decrease of 5.8 days compared to September 30, 2023 due to increases in average benefit expense per day. The operating expense ratio was 11.8 percent, an improvement of 110 basis points. Excluding adjustment items, the operating expense ratio was 9.6 percent, an improvement of 150 basis points, reflecting disciplined cost management to enhance operating efficiency. Cash Flow & Balance Sheet Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of approximately $0.1 billion year-over-year. As of September 30, 2024, cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $2.6 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock for $60 million, at a weighted average price of $511.01, and paid a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $378 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of Board approved share repurchase authorization remaining. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $8.0 billion increase to the common stock repurchase program. The Company intends to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Health Benefits is comprised of Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard ®, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal Health Products & Services businesses. Health Benefits Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $38.3 $36.7 $37.2 Operating Gain1 $1.6 $1.8 $2.1 Operating Margin1 4.2 % 5.0 % 5.8 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Health Benefits segment operating revenue was $38.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher premium yields, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. Operating gain totaled $1.6 billion, impacted primarily by the unfavorable mix shift in Medicaid membership related to eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by premium rate increases, focused medical management, and the proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency. Medical membership totaled approximately 45.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 3 percent, driven by attrition in our Medicaid business associated with eligibility redeterminations and footprint adjustments in certain Medicaid states. These losses were partially offset by growth in Employer Group fee-based and Affordable Care Act health plan membership. Carelon is comprised of CarelonRx and Carelon Services. Carelon Reportable Segment Highlights (Unaudited) (In billions) Three Months Ended September 30,2024 September 30,2023 June 30,2024 Operating Revenue1 $13.8 $12.0 $13.3 Operating Gain1 $0.8 $0.7 $0.7 Operating Margin1 5.8 % 5.6 % 5.3 % See Basis of Presentation herein. Operating revenue for Carelon was $13.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15 percent compared to the prior year quarter. This was driven by the launch and growth of risk-based capabilities in Carelon Services and growth in CarelonRx product revenue, related to the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare in the first quarter and increases in external members served. Operating gain for Carelon totaled $0.8 billion, an increase of $134 million, or 20 percent, primarily driven by growth in product revenue and a one-time favorable intra-year true up in CarelonRx, partially offset by results in our Carelon Health businesses. Quarterly Dividend On October 15, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 dividend to shareholders of $1.63 per share. The fourth quarter dividend is payable on December 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2024.

Elevance Health GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited) This document references non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted Shareholders' Net Income, Adjusted Shareholders' Net Income Per Share, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Gain, Adjusted Operating Expense and Adjusted Operating Expense Ratio, which are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are intended to aid investors when comparing Elevance Health's financial results among periods and are not intended to be alternatives to any measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are available below. In addition to these non-GAAP measures, references are made to the measures Operating Revenue and Operating Gain/Loss, Operating Margin and Adjusted EPS. Operating revenue and operating gain/loss are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reportable segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain/loss is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense. It does not include net investment income, net gains/losses on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Each of these measures is provided to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing Elevance Health's operating and financial results. A reconciliation of Operating Revenue to Total Revenue is set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Income herein. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, together with a reconciliation of reportable segments operating gain to income before income tax expense, is provided below. Prior amounts may be grouped differently to conform to the current presentation. Net adjustment items per share may not sum due to rounding.
