Mondelez International (MDLZ) stock was one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 Friday after Wells Fargo upgraded its rating and lifted its price target on the snacks and candy giant. Wells Fargo analysts lifted their rating to "overweight" from "equal weight" and raised their price target to $78 from $68, saying the "bull case feels more tangible" for the Chips Ahoy!, Oreo, and Sour Patch Kids parent. "While the company is confronting historical inflation in 2025, 1) pricing execution has been strong, 2) inflation looks likely to temper in 2026, and we see a recovery of earnings ahead," the analysts wrote. Mondelez International shares were up more than 3% in recent trading to about $68.50. They have gained roughly 15% this year.
