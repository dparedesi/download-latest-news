Manage your account Donald Trump’s impending return to the White House has boosted some industrial sectors he has historically championed and others he advocated for during his campaign. It’s no surprise that Tesla (TSLA) stock has been soaring since Trump’s victory given Elon Musk’s endorsement and closeness to the president-elect in recent months. In the same vein, Trump Media (DJT), the social media platform founded by the former president, is on the rise following his victory. But Tesla and Trump Media shares aren’t the only ones expected to appreciate following Trump’s victory. Other sectors likely to benefit include banking, private prisons, cryptocurrency, and the non-renewable energy industry. Here’s a look at stocks poised to thrive in a Trump 2.0 era. Shares of JPMorgan (JPM) have seen significant growth since Election Day, fueled by investor optimism that Trump’s return to the White House will usher in a period of reduced regulation. The former and now-future president has long pushed for scaling back regulations across industries. For banks, that will ease what had been growing concerns over antitrust scrutiny and looming capital requirements that have slowed both potential investment banking and lending revenues. During his campaign, Trump promised to cut the corporate tax rate from 21% to as low as 15%. Moreover, he pledged to remove Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office. Currently, JPMorgan (JPM) shares are trading at $240, reflecting an increase of more than 9% over the past week and a nearly 40% rise for the year so far. Morgan Stanley (MS) shares have surged following Trump’s victory, driven by expectations of increased bank deregulation. Currently, the stock (MS) is trading at $132, reflecting a 14% gain over the past week and a nearly 40% rise year-to-date. A more lenient approach from Trump’s antitrust regulators could pave the way for a wave of deals that seemed uncertain under the current regulatory environment. Reuters has suggested that banks may benefit from faster approval timelines in the M&A landscape. Shares of credit card companies, like Capital One (COF), surged on optimism that a proposed merger with Discover Financial Services (DFS) could finally move forward under Trump’s leadership, as it has previously faced regulatory hurdles. Currently, Capital One (COF) stock is trading at $189, reflecting a 17% gain over the past week and a nearly 43% rise year-to-date. Shares of Discover Financial Services (DFS) have been surging since Trump’s win, hoping for a smooth merger with Capital One (COF). Currently, Discover (DFS) stock is trading at $180, reflecting a 20% gain over the past week and over 60% rise year-to-date. Shares of GEO Group Inc., a company specializing in the management of private prisons and detention centers, are climbing amid expectations that Trump’s policies will lead to increased detention of migrants entering the country illegally. Late Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Tom Homan, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and a proponent of the “zero tolerance” policy, will serve as his administration’s “border czar.” Currently, Geo Group (GEO) stock is trading at $26, reflecting an 81% gain over the past week and over 144% rise year-to-date. Shares of private prison company CoreCivic are surging post-election, as investors anticipate that a Trump administration will enforce stricter policies on immigrants entering the country illegally, driving demand for detention facilities. Currently, CoreCivic (CXW) stock is trading at $23, reflecting a 78% gain over the past week and over 65% rise year-to-date. This year, Trump emerged as a pro-crypto leader and pledged to create a Bitcoin reserve. The fact that crypto companies are thriving after his victory is not surprising. On Monday, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced it spent the first weeks of November accumulating Bitcoin. Between October 31 and November 10, the company purchased 27,200 Bitcoin for approximately $2.03 billion, at an average price of $74,463 per Bitcoin. This latest acquisition brings MicroStrategy’s total holdings to 279,420 Bitcoin, valued at nearly $24 billion at current market prices. Currently, MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock is trading at $340, reflecting a 45% gain over the past week and a 396% rise year-to-date. Coinbase (COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., was one of the leading crypto companies advocating for a crypto-friendly government. Following the confirmation of Trump’s victory, CEO Brian Armstrong took to X to share data indicating that the upcoming Senate and House of Representatives will have a majority pro-crypto congresspeople. Currently, Coinbase (COIN) stock is trading at $324, reflecting a 74% gain over the past week and a 106% rise year-to-date. During his speech at the Bitcoin conference, Trump said Bitcoin “is the steel of the future,” and he wants it to be “mined, minted, and made” on American soil. He met with executives from prominent crypto mining firms, listening to their challenges and discussing ways to enhance the industry’s growth. This pro-crypto stance has sent a surge of optimism through the industry, especially among major crypto mining companies like MARA Holdings Inc. (formerly Marathon Digital Holdings) (MARA). Currently, MARA Holdings (MARA) stock is trading at $25, reflecting a 56% gain over the past week and a 9% rise year-to-date. It is generally expected that Trump will favor policies that would benefit American oil companies. Non-renewable energy stocks, which provide services to the oil and energy industry, performed well after his victory. EQT (EQT), a natural gas producer that engages in hydrocarbon exploration and pipeline transport, has surged since Trump’s win. Currently, EQT (EQT) stock is trading at $44, reflecting a 44% gain over the past week and a 13% rise year-to-date. Baker Hughes (BKR) (BKR), an energy technology company, also surged after Trump’s victory in the election. Currently, Baker Hughes (BKR) is trading at $44, up 10% over the last week and up over 30% for the year so far. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Elon Musk joined Trump on Capitol Hill for a meeting with Republicans—and the president-elect used the opportunity to ridicule the richest man in the world. The MSNBC anchor mocks Musk's joint press release and suggests the X owner won't last 18 months The post Elon Musk Suffers ‘Humiliating Demotion’ With Trump’s DOGE Appointment, Lawrence O’Donnell Says: ‘Going to Fail Miserably’ appeared first on TheWrap. Justine Bateman feels like she can breathe again after the presidential election. She's not alone – though many disagree. "Latino male Trump voter told CNN mass deportation won't extend to law-abiding workers. 'That wouldn’t be fair. They need to make sure that they don’t throw away, they don’t kick out, they don’t deport people that are family oriented.'" This is a national security disaster. "The Russian economy is effectively facing the threat of stagflation — simultaneous stagnation or even recession and high inflation," TsMAKP said. Video footage shared by Ukraine's 33rd Separate Mechanized Brigade appears to show a devastating attack on a Russian convoy in Donetsk. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) pleaded with fellow Republicans to back Donald Trump’s choice as attorney general, Matt Gaetz, after initially sounding skeptical about the bombshell pick. Appearing on Fox News’ Hannity on Wednesday, Graham said: “To every Republican, give Matt a chance.” His remark came amid a growing rebellion from GOP ranks over the surprise decision. Several Republican senators openly showed their disdain, saying it wasn’t a “serious” appointment. It’s unlikely that Trump can turn the country into a dictatorship with a few strokes of a pen. The courts are working in America, the sprawling federal bureaucracy is formidable and presidents do not control the individual states. "The people that put all of you Democrats in office are expecting ACTION for once!!" In 2024, the Veterans’ Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 accounted for nearly $120 million in government funds despite its appropriations being authorized through 1998 Naughty List While Elon Musk and president-elect Donald Trump are apparently closer than ever, the famously mercurial Trump seems to be growing weary of Musk's clinginess.

[…] Within minutes of President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement of Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth as his selection for Secretary of Defense, current and former senior military commanders began messaging and calling me with their reactions. “Ridiculous,” said one. “An effing (euphemism inserted) nightmare,” said another. To be clear, these were not partisans, but senior commanders who have served under both Presidents Trump and Joe Biden. Here are some of the most outrageous things Pete Hegseth has said. In the wake of recent global market shifts, including a notable rally in U.S. stocks driven by expectations of economic growth and tax reforms, investors are keenly observing how these changes might influence their portfolios. Amidst this backdrop, dividend stocks have emerged as a compelling option for those seeking steady income streams; they offer potential yields that can provide some stability against market volatility. President-elect joked on Wednesday that ‘Elon won’t go home’ and that he ‘can’t get rid of him’ Key Trump allies are warning Republican senators to fall in line—or else. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she was “pretty sure” the next attorney general would prosecute people for “crimes against humanity” committed during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Preparing for the next pandemic is actually recognizing that the last pandemic resulted in crimes against humanity,” Greene said during a hearing on preparing for future pandemics. “People that… Jesse Watters Primetime host boasted of his ties to some of those headed for the most powerful jobs in government Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) hit a new 52-week low on Thursday morning as the AI-focused hardware company struggles with filing its quarterly report (Form 10-Q) for the period ending September 30. The San Jose-based company notified the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of the delay in a recent filing, saying it needs more time to select and engage a new accounting firm to review financial statements for fiscal 2024. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, is now refusing to stand by her previous push for Ukraine’s NATO membership — a stance she once framed as critical to regional stability. Michael Saylor is a perennial crypto bull. The tradition-bucking Melania Trump likely won’t call the White House home these next four years. Discussions about how—and where—the 52-year-old will spend her days in Donald Trump’s second term remains “ongoing,” CNN reported Wednesday, but sources said she’s “unlikely to move to Washington full time in her second go-round as first lady.” Melania won’t be entirely absent in Washington, the network reported. She’s still expected to turn up to major events like state dinners and have her own “pl Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence, affirmed President-elect Trump’s decision to appoint Pete Hegseth as secretary of Defense on Wednesday. “Pete served 20 years. He was awarded the Bronze Star twice in Iraq and Afghanistan. He’s somebody that I got to know when he was running Concerned… The Taliban Supreme Court on Wednesday announced the public execution of a convicted murderer in Afghanistan’s eastern province of Paktia. Taliban officials and local residents observed the execution, which took place in a sports stadium in the regional capital Gardez. In a statement, the Supreme Court identified the convicted murderer as Ayaz Asad, a local resident of the province who had intentionally killed another Afghan using a Kalashnikov rifle. The execution was carried out after the vict In the frenzy of election season, the Georgia congresswoman carved out some quiet time to increase positions in her favorite stocks. Shares of cloud-data warehousing stock Snowflake were significantly pared down in the third quarter in favor of an up-and-coming customer relationship management (CRM) company. The New York Times journalist also said the president-elect's controversial choices are designed to do two things. Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon used an Air Force One plane known as SAM 970. The retired jet is now a museum exhibit. Warren Buffett is more than just a big name in the investing world -- he's a legend.

The CNN host's words of disbelief may haunt you if the Florida extremist is confirmed as the attorney general. White House Down Babyish billionaire Elon Musk and Donald Trump have been growing closer recently, though the President-elect's team is reportedly weary of their relationship. “He’s behaving as if he’s a co-president and making sure everyone knows it,” one person familiar with the matter told NBC News. Recently, Trump announced that Musk and former Republican […] If you're looking for attractive dividend stocks, this pair of high-yielders has what it takes to keep paying you well over time. Two prominent supporters of President-elect Trump’s campaign have emerged as the front-runners to lead the Treasury Department during his second administration. Trump has reportedly narrowed his list to Scott Bessent, founder of Key Square Group, and Howard Lutnick, chair and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. Both spent millions to reelect Trump, have played key roles in… Alyssa Farah Griffin says she urged Gaetz not to present Trump with the "printed out conspiracy theories" about Joe Scarborough. McCaskill said Thursday that 11 senators could stand in Gaetz's way of being appointed as Trump's attorney general. We're past the bad place.

Nvidia Analysts Optimistic as Q3 Earnings Near; AI Chip Demand Expected to Fuel Growth These are income stocks you can buy and hold forever. I can't believe I've never seen this before. Advanced Micro Devices said Wednesday roughly 4% of approximately 26,000 employees worldwide will be laid off. About 1,000 AMD workers will lose their jobs. Indicators point to considerable gains for these three tech names. As the recent post-election stock market rally begins to fizzle, major indexes have shown mixed performances, with investors recalibrating expectations around interest rate cuts and inflation data. In this uncertain environment, dividend stocks can offer a measure of stability and income potential for portfolios by providing regular payouts regardless of market fluctuations. There is a list of investors that you might call Wall Street legends, and sitting near the top (if not at the very head of the list) is Warren Buffett. Buffett is the chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), a stock that hasn't just beaten the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the long term, it has trounced it. What has Berkshire Hathaway done? This year has been great for stocks, as indexes confirmed the presence of a bull market and then went on to reach multiple record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes 30 of the top large-cap stocks powering today's economy, roared past 40,000 for the first time ever and is now heading for a gain of about 16% since the start of the year. History shows that bull markets generally last much longer than bear markets -- nearly nine years versus less than two, according to First Trust data -- and that suggests stocks may continue to climb. Donald Trump’s supporters suddenly seem a lot less sure of their decision. Donald Trump selected Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to identify areas for government-spending cuts. The US spends the most on Social Security. Electric vehicle (EV) maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) said late Tuesday that it closed a hugely important deal, in which giant Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY) will invest billions in the California-based upstart. The Volkswagen deal ensures that Rivian will have ample cash to launch its smaller, higher-volume R2 and R3 models -- and opens up a potentially lucrative new market for its technology. In a nutshell, Rivian and Volkswagen have formed a joint venture that will take the technology Rivian is developing for its upcoming R2 model and adapt it for some of Volkswagen's upcoming electric vehicles. Here's what to know about Trump's eldest grandchild Kai, who made her political debut earlier this year at the Republican National Convention.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stands against the other best stocks under $100. Wall Street experts believe that mid-cap stocks might be well-placed for a strong run-up. As per Ryan Detrick (Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group), historically, midcaps outperform once the US Fed actually initiates cutting rates. According to him, the small and mid-caps are expected to surge up to 20% over the upcoming 12 months, far exceeding the large-cap counterparts. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs believes that mid-caps outperform large- and small-cap stocks over the 12 months after the first rate cut. As market experts continue to expect a soft landing, the investors might look for other options apart from the biggest companies. As per the earnings sight report from FactSet dated 1st November, the S&P 500 continues to report mixed results. The Q3 remained strong for risk assets and safe havens, with the US markets delivering an all-time closing high to finish Q3 and bonds posting positive returns, as per JPMorgan Asset Management. Overall, the S&P 500 gaining for 4th straight quarter (making 18 new highs), and the US Treasuries and corporate bonds rallying with the decline in yields dominated much of the movements in Q3 2024. The asset management firm also added that gold saw its biggest gain since Q1 2016 (thanks to the expectations of faster rate cuts) and China’s stimulus supported equity market returns. What is expected for Q4 2024 now? JPM believes that positive expected earnings growth, cooling inflation, easing policies of central banks, and firm job creation should help create a strong backdrop for risk assets. Wall Street analysts believe that mid-caps might be in a position to see strong growth moving forward. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per BofA’s Jill Carey Hall, mid-caps can be considered as the “best hedge” for the near term. According to Hall, the mid-caps have experienced better recent guidance and revision trends and have also surpassed the small caps on average in the downturn scenarios. Mid-caps can also act as a hedge against fewer-than-expected rate cuts, considering that small caps are rate-sensitive. According to Goldman’s Jenny Ma, the start of the rate-cut cycle remains a potential source of incremental equity demand and a boost to broader investor risk sentiment. Moreover, over the short term, mid-cap performance as compared to other segments is expected to be dependent on the strength of economic growth data, along with the pace of the easing cycle. As per Wells Fargo, mid-cap growth stocks are technically oversold as of now. Despite this, these stocks have a significant scope to outperform. It also added that stability in their earnings, risk, liquidity, and balance sheet appear to be more attractive as compared to small caps. With these trends in mind, let’s take a look at the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. To list the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In, we first used a screener to extract stocks trading under $100. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Stock Price as of November 6: $96.08 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of coffee. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)’s brand strength stems from its pricing power, attractive unit-level economics, and successful international replication. Wall Street remains optimistic about the leadership change. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) brought in Brian Niccol as its new Chairman and CEO. Analysts opine that his experience in fueling operational efficiencies, improving marketing strategies, and fostering product innovation should be a perfect fit for the company’s current needs. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will continue to benefit from a healthy brand presence and customer loyalty throughout various generational cohorts. Its focus on improving throughput, enhancing digital marketing, and driving product innovation appears to be critical for maintaining and strengthening its competitive edge. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been emphasizing product innovation as a critical driver of customer interest and sales growth. The company’s initiatives which are focused on streamlining operations, optimizing store formats, and leveraging technology for improved efficiency are expected to yield substantial benefits. Analysts at Morgan Stanley increased their price target on the shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) from $98.00 to $115.00, giving it an “Overweight” rating on 16th October. ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Similarly, we took advantage of a business reset at Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the third quarter to initiate a position in the global coffee retailer. A confluence of factors, including degraded store-level operations and long consumer wait times, consumer fatigue with high prices and weakening engagement among occasional Starbucks customers has led to declining U.S. same-store sales growth. While the path ahead will likely require reinvestment back into the business, there are many merits to Starbucks’ business including its strong brand name and category leading market position. In response to recent challenges, Starbucks has appointed change-agent CEO Brian Niccol, who we know from the Strategy’s ownership of Chipotle Mexican Grill during its turnaround. Niccol has a successful track record of investing in product innovation and fixing execution issues, which we believe are the primary challenges facing Starbucks today. Starbucks represents the kind of successful playbook we have executed on historically – focusing on high-quality businesses and brands while being disciplined around the entry point into investments with attractive risk-reward opportunities.” Overall, SBUX ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks under $100 to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SBUX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
