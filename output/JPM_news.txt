Major U.S. equity indexes moved lower as markets wrapped up the third quarter's first full week of trading. Trade policy remained in focus heading into the weekend, with Canada among the latest countries to receive a letter from President Donald Trump about tariffs set to take effect in August. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% on Friday, retreating from the record closing high set in the previous session. The Nasdaq also fell from record levels, ticking 0.2% lower, while the Dow dropped 0.6%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. PayPal (PYPL) shares fell 5.7%, retreating the most of any S&P 500 constituent. The payment processor's stock came under pressure following reports that JPMorgan Chase (JPM) plans to begin charging financial technology companies for access to customer data. The move from the largest U.S. bank could have ripple effects as fintechs face fees for data that they previously received without direct charges. The re-escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada weighed on stocks with exposure to the northern neighbor. Shares of human resources software provider Dayforce (DAY) lost 5.2%. In addition to operating headquarters in Toronto as well as Minneapolis, Dayforce has a significant business presence in Canada, including a recently inked contract with the Canadian government. Analysts have suggested that tariff-related impacts on its operations should be limited. Caesars Entertainment (CZR) shares declined 4.7%, giving back a portion of the gains posted in the prior session. Casino stocks came under pressure after regional gaming revenue reports from Indiana and Iowa showed that gaming win totals for casinos in those states were down year-over-year in June. Shares of United Airlines (UAL) sank 4.3%, adjusting their altitude a day after posting the S&P 500's strongest gains with a double-digit surge. Although a strong earnings report and reinstated guidance from Delta (DAL) boosted sentiment around airline stocks this week, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal reportedly expressed concerns that a proposed partnership between United and JetBlue (JBLU) could be harmful to competition. Crude oil futures prices rose about 3% on Friday, with summer travel demand helping sustain the market as forecasts suggest that supply growth could lead to surplus conditions later in the year. Shares of oilfield services firm Halliburton (HAL) advanced 4.2%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500, as TD Cowen analysts lifted their price target on the stock. Shares of Halliburton rival Baker Hughes (BKR) added 2.5%. The Wall Street Journal reported that packaged food giant Kraft Heinz (KHC) is preparing for a restructuring plan that could involve spinning off a significant portion of its grocery business. Shares of the company, home to its namesake cheese and ketchup as well as an array of other well-known brands, gained 2.5%. News of the potential break-up of Kraft Heinz came a day after cereal maker WK Kellogg (KLG) said it had been acquired by Italian sweets company The Ferrero Group.

Title: ‘The Math Just Doesn’t Work’ – Analyst Hits JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs With Downgrade, Says Downside Risk Not Factored In

HSBC is detailing its major downgrade of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. On Tuesday, HSBC dropped its recommendation on JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) from hold to reduce. The firm also downgraded the recommendation on Bank of America from buy to hold. In an interview, HSBC’s head of US financials research, Saul Martinez, says the banks have solid fundamentals, but their valuations raise concerns. “We were not adopting a more negative view of operating fundamentals. We still think that net interest income is on the right track. You know, you are seeing some growth there. Obviously, there are some nuances to each of the downgrades, JPMorgan, Goldman to reduce and Bank of America to hold, but at a high level, it’s valuation. Pricing is not factoring in downside risk and the dilutive impact of buybacks at much higher multiples.” Martinez says he was not convinced that JPMorgan deserves its price. “In JPMorgan’s case, I think the math just doesn’t work at these valuations. The stock, so with banks, you look at price to tangible book value multiples and return on tangible common equity. Higher ROTC (return on tangible common equity), higher price to tangible. JPMorgan is trading close to three times tangible. That is a very elevated multiple.” He says it’s a similar case for Goldman Sachs. “We feel like we’re swimming against the tide with Goldman a little bit because the investment banking landscape is good. The risk-reward is very skewed here. We think good news is priced in, but again, if the market cools off and IB (investment banking) activity doesn’t really move forward, we don’t get a super cycle in IB activity, I think there’s more room for disappointment here than for upside.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Shares of MP Materials (MP) surged 50% in Thursday morning after the rare earths miner announced a multibillion-dollar agreement with the Department of Defense. The DoD is set to become MP Materials' largest shareholder at 15% following an initial $400 million purchase of a new class of "preferred stock convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, and a warrant permitting DoD to purchase additional shares of the Company's common stock." MP Materials will use the government investment, along with a $1 billion funding line from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to fund the construction of its second domestic magnet manufacturing facility at a yet-to-be-decided location. The company also agreed to a 10-year deal with the DoD establishing the government as a long-term customer of MP's rare earths with a price floor of $110 per kilogram. The Trump administration has stated that becoming less dependent on other nations like China for rare earths—metals used in production of a variety of commercial and military products—is a top priority and national security concern. Shares of MP and USA Rare Earth (USAR) have been boosted this year by that commitment. MP Materials hit their highest price since April 2022 on Thursday morning, while USA Rare Earth shares were up nearly 14% shortly after markets opened. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

U.S. equities were slightly lower at midday as the market weighed the potential impact of the latest Trump administration tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrials Average slipped 0.2%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down marginally. Shares of alternative energy firms, including Enphase Energy (ENPH), First Solar (FSLR), NextEra Energy (NEE), dipped after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to slash most government support for the industry. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and rival gold miners declined along with the price of the precious metal as higher bond yields made gold a less attractive investment. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Goldman Sachs (GS) slipped on downgrades from HSBC, which warned it had become more cautious about bank stocks following their recent runup. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) shares gained on an upgrade from Wolfe Research, which brushed off previous concerns about the toolmaker's earnings revisions, and saw improvement in its end markets. U.S.-listed shares of Sequans Communications (SQNS) soared when the Paris-based manufacturer of semiconductors for the Internet of Things said it had raised $384 million to begin buying bitcoin. GlobalFoundries (GFS) shares jumped after the chipmaker bought artificial intelligence and processor IP supplier MIPS. The price was not given. Oil futures advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the pound and yen, and was little changed against the euro. Major cryptocurrencies mostly rose. TradingView
