Stocks’ losses eased after data showed the labor market holding up and fourth-quarter economic growth was revised higher. The good news helped temper the impact of Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts — which sent General Motors (GM-1.66%) and some peers down. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated after fourth-quarter GDP growth was revised up 2.4% annually from 2.3%, reflecting higher investment and a downward revision to import growth. New filings for jobless benefits remained steady in the week to March 22, as did continuing claims for the priror week. “Hard to see recession in these data, but the real test will be the initial read on Q1 2025 GDP, when the trade shocks feed into the numbers — that may not look so rosy,” Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an email. “The labor market is far stronger and resilient than folks appreciate.” Automakers weren’t a big beneficiary of the batter data, as they face higher costs under Trump’s tariffs that they’ll either have to absorb or pass on to customers. JPMorgan (JPM-2.49%) downgraded its price targets for GM, Ford (F-2.47%) and Ferrari (RACE+0.72%). GM stock plunged 6.5%, Ford declined 2%, and Stellantis (STLA-4.11%) fell 1.5%. The U.S.-traded shares of some foreign automakers slid, with Toyota (TM-2.91%) and Honda (HMC-5.39%) both falling more than 2%. Ferrari reversed an earlier decline after saying it’ll raise American prices for its cars by up to 10% after the tariffs go into effect April 2. Tesla (TSLA-3.54%), one of the automakers least affected by the tariffs, rebounded from initial lows to trade more than 3% higher. Elon Musk said the electric vehicle makers, which relies on some imported parts, will take a hit from the tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA-1.14%) stock slid about 1.2% after dropping 5.7% yesterday. Beijing has asked firms in China to use energy-efficient chips in data centers, the Financial Times reported on March 25. GameStop (GME-0.14%) plunged 25%, more than surrendering its gain yesterday after it announced plans to raise $1.3 billion by selling convertible senior notes due 2030 to finance Bitcoin investments. Jefferies (JEF-3.94%) stock plunged more than 9% after the investment bank’s quarterly earnings missed expectations, with revenue 14.5% below the StreetAccount consensus forecast and earnings per share 39% lower. Concentrix (CNXC-15.62%) stock jumped 37% after the outsourcing company’s quarterly per-share profit of $2.79 exceeded expectations by about 8.1%, and CEO Chris Caldwell used the earnings call to express confidence in the firms AI strategy. —With reporting by William Gavin Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Ferrari's luxury cars are about to get more expensive, thanks to Trump's tariffs

American buyers of Ferrari’s (RACE+0.72%) luxury vehicles will soon have to pay higher prices, as the Italian automaker looks to offset the burden of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Trump administration’s new 25% tariffs on all imports of finished cars and trucks and of auto parts are set to go into effect on April 3. Almost half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, as are almost 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the U.S. Ferrari said Thursday that the impact of the tariffs would be partially reflected in its pricing for almost all imports after April 2. Excluding imports of Ferrari 297, SF90, and Roma vehicles, new cars could become as much as 10% more expensive. Some 40% of Ferrari’s global sales come from the U.S. market. “And while Ferrari demand may prove amongst the least elastic to moderate changes in price...Ferrari purchases are arguably amongst the most discretionary also, and so we could envision some buyers electing to delay taking delivery,” JPMorgan (JPM-2.49%) analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a Thursday note. Analysts at Bernstein (AB-0.30%) led by Stephen Reitman argued in a Thursday note that U.S. customers won’t be pushed away by higher prices. Ferrari’s customers tend to be wealthier individuals who will be less impacted by tariffs, which put more pressure on poorer consumers. “We are hard-pressed to think of any customer cohort in the U.S. that is better placed than Ferrari’s to absorb higher prices,” the Bernstein analysts said. “Any increase in new prices will be somewhat cushioned by the knowledge that the customer’s other Ferraris in their garage have seen their values rise.” JPMorgan lowered its December 2025 price target for Ferrari by 12%, to $460 per share from $525 per share, while Bernstein maintained an outperform rating on the stock. Ferrari stock is up by almost 2% and trades at $421 per share. Ferrari said its financial targets for 2025 will remain unchanged. The company has forecast adjusted earnings of at least 2.68 billion euros ($2.88 billion), an increase of at least 5%, and net revenue of more than 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for the full year. Ferrari recorded net profit of 1.53 billion euros ($1.6 billion) and revenue of 6.7 billion euros ($7.2 billion) in 2024. That’s an increase of 21% and 12%, respectively, compared to 2023.

Title: JPMorgan drops its price target for Ford, GM, and Ferrari as Trump's 'draconian' tariffs loom

General Motors’ (GM-1.66%), Ford Motor’s (F-2.47%), and Ferrari’s (RACE+0.72%) earnings are likelier than ever to take a hit, as President Donald Trump’s “draconian” tariffs and anti-electric vehicle policies hang over the automakers, according to JPMorgan (JPM-2.49%) analysts. The Trump administration’s new 25% tariffs on all imports of parts and finished cars and trucks are set to go into effect on April 3. Almost half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, as are almost 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the U.S. “Anybody who has plants in the United States, it’s going to be good for,” Trump said Wednesday of his tariffs. JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman lowered their December price target for GM to $53 per share from $64 per share, for Ford to $11 per share from $13 per share, and for Ferrari to $460 per share from $525 per share, according to a Thursday note. GM stock dropped 3% on Wednesday as Trump made his auto tariff announcement, then slipped as much as 6.5% on Thursday. Ferrari’s stock slid almost 5% on Wednesday but rose 1.6% on Thursday. Ford shares are down 2%. The S&P 500 Automobiles sub-index is up almost 2%, but down 28% year-to-date. Automakers had received a brief break from Trump’s earlier 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada after the president said all vehicles covered by the USMCA trade pact would not be subject to duties for one month. That exemption, which primarily benefitted companies like GM and Ford, ends next week. JPMorgan expects GM to face a $10.5 billion tariff bill, which could rise to $13 billion over time. The automaker imports vehicles from South Korea, Canada, and Mexico. Ford’s bill will be much lower, $2 billion to start, but will gradually rise to $4.5 billion. The analysts now expect the auto industry to take a $82 billion annual hit, up from an initial estimate of $41 billion, assuming that automakers absorb the cost of the tariffs. If they decide to pass the costs on to consumers, light-vehicle prices could rise by up to 11.4%. The Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group previously estimated that a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canadian imports would add between $4,000 and $10,000 per unit to vehicles assembled in North America. Trump’s tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel add another $250 to $800 per gas-powered vehicle and up to $2,500 on EVs. “Under the new scheme virtually all automakers will face significant pressure to raise prices, making it more likely domestic automakers will be able to effect price increases to better offset tariff costs without the risk of material market share loss,” Brinkman said in the note. Ferrari on Thursday became the first automaker to raise prices in response to Trump’s new tariff threat. The Italian company said exports to the U.S. after the tariffs take effect will be priced up by as much as 10%. However, exports of Ferrari 296, SF90, and Roma vehicles will not be subject to higher prices. The tariffs are expected to stick around. When asked how long the duties would likely stay in effect, Trump said they would be permanent. While practically all automakers have been making moves to lessen the effect of Trump’s tariffs, they still expect damage. “Let’s be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in February.

Title: How to invest in this market sell-off, according to a top fund that's survived every crash since 1929

In the last 96 years, the Vanguard Wellington Fund (VWELX) has been through it all. Three months after its inception, what's now the third-longest-active mutual fund got rocked by the Wall Street crash of 1929, which effectively marked the start of the Great Depression. And in the decades after that disaster, it faced a litany of wars, recessions, and the financial crisis. Needless to say, portfolio managers Loren Moran and Daniel Pozen are undaunted by this latest stock-market correction. They're confident in their time-tested investing strategy, which has lifted the $113 billion fund past 92% of its competitors in the last 15 years, according to Morningstar. However, while many bottom-up investors simply block out the noise, Moran and Pozen think a tunnel-vision approach to investing is misguided. Instead, they go on the hunt during selloffs. "Where there's volatility, and there may be perceived weaknesses in companies that we disagree with, it certainly is a good hunting ground in terms of finding ideas and an opportunity to add alpha as well," Moran said in a recent interview. Being opportunistic doesn't mean becoming a day trader. Pozen stressed to Business Insider the importance of patience and maintaining a long-term perspective. He said he's focused on how his investments and fund fare over several years instead of sweating quarterly swings. Investors have been anxious about a lot lately. US stocks have gotten slammed in the last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs on key trade partners raise the risk of trade wars that may cause either a recession or stagflation, which is marked by weak growth and higher prices. Add in the market's elevated valuation, and it's clear why many are cutting equity exposure. In this momentum-driven market, these headlines can cause people to jump to conclusions, Moran said. So while it's smart to stay attuned to what's happening, she and Pozen are wary of overreacting to any narrative, including that economic growth is increasingly likely to fall flat. Successful stock selection is what separates mutual funds from the pack, and Pozen said choosing quality companies at a discount becomes much easier during down markets. "Cyclical companies that are perceived to have lots of exposure to that environment — if they're sold off as a result, then we will look at that company and see to what extent the stock price reflects too negative an outlook or skew, in terms of the range of outcomes for the business," Pozen said. In other words, when investors race to one side of the metaphorical boat — whether it's by chasing the same stocks or sectors — Pozen is comfortable with taking the other side. That said, a quick glance at the Vanguard Wellington Fund shows that its five largest holdings are all mega-cap growth stocks: Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. Pozen said that he had to have some exposure to those names to keep pace with the S&P 500, as is his mandate. Going forward, he said he doubts they'll keep rising as much as they have. "It is an objective fact that seven stocks have been the primary driver of the whole market's returns over the last number of years," Pozen said of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. "Now, there is a reasonable case to be made that the path forward for these companies will be more divergent than it has been in the past." However, Pozen and Moran adhering to their fund's strategy is different from following the crowd. A few years ago, the classic 60-40 stock-bond portfolio came under immense pressure, leading some to write obituaries for that once-widely accepted investing strategy. But the fund managers held to their 65-35 stock-bond split, in part because Moran noted that her predecessors made a mistake 50 years ago by bending to asset allocation shifts instead of holding fast and trusting the fund's decades-long track record. "There was a slight move in the early '70s where the asset allocation shifted more towards stocks, and that was actually a period of much more challenging equity returns as well," Moran said. "And so the shareholders really did not benefit from that more aggressive equity-fixed income mix." Studying prior selloffs can yield lessons about the present, the fund managers said, and they hope to capitalize on that knowledge now. When asked where investors should put fresh money to work, Pozen had a clear answer: large-cap banks. He also specifically highlighted Wells Fargo (WFC), which is his largest position on a relative basis, after the mega-cap stocks he needs to keep pace with the index. And it's a few spots ahead of financial giant JPMorgan (JPM), which fits this thesis he outlined. Since the financial crisis, the financial sector has been under tremendous regulatory pressure, and banks have borne the brunt of that scrutiny, Pozen said. "The regulators have really put their thumb on the scale," Pozen said, noting the liquidity ratios and capital requirements large banks had to comply with. "And that has resulted in suppressing returns on equity and growth rates for the sector with good positive outcomes, which are soundness and safety of the sector and economic stability." That overhang is likely to either lift or be lessened during Trump's second term, Pozen noted. He remarked that regulatory pressure "may or may not get better, but it's at least plateauing." In response, Pozen loves large banks that are well capitalized and have the scale and technology investments necessary to take even more market share and ward off fintech rivals. Plus, valuations for many financial firms are dirt-cheap relative to the broader market, especially in Wells Fargo's case. The San Francisco-based bank took tons of heat in the late 2010s for its risk management and sales practices. However, Pozen is confident in CEO Charlie Scharf's leadership in recent years, and the stock has responded accordingly, with shares up 46% since the start of 2024 after a yearslong slump. He's looking forward to seeing what Wells Fargo can do once it's unburdened by excess liquidity and heightened operational costs that come with the regulatory scrutiny it's faced. "As you see regulatory pressure ease for the industry — doubly or triply true for the company — it should be a great opportunity for Wells Fargo to finally realize the potential of the brand and the potential of the business as they get out from some of those pressures," Pozen said.
