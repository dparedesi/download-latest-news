We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. The index rose 0.3% over the previous month, matching economists' expectations but higher than the 0.2% seen in October. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in October climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month.

Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) turned more bullish on some bitcoin (BTC) mining stocks in its coverage following third quarter results and recent gains in bitcoin price and the network hashrate, the bank said in a report on Tuesday. The bank upgraded Cipher Mining (CIFR) and CleanSpark (CLSK) to overweight from neutral. JPMorgan also introduced a new price $8 price target for Cipher, and raised its CleanSpark price target to $17 from $10.50. MARA Holdings (MARA) was also upgraded to neutral from underweight and raised its price target on the stock to $23 from $12. The U.S. bank downgraded IREN (IREN) to neutral from overweight while increasing its price target on the shares to $15 from $9.50. It raised its Riot Platforms (RIOT) price target to $16 from $9.50, while maintaining its overweight rating on the company. The bank said it was introducing a new sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation framework for the miners, which took into account company's mining operations, their respective land and power portfolios, and their hodl balance to reflect any bitcoin that the firms may hold on their balance sheet. Cipher rose over 4% in early trading Tuesday, CleanSpark gained around 3.5%, MARA climbed over 2%, RIOT was almost 2% higher, and IREN was 0.4% better.

Title: What's Happening With JPMorgan Stock?

JP Morgan headquarters at Canary Wharf financial district on 5th November 2024 in London, United ... [+] Kingdom. (photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has gained about 48% year-to-date, compared to the 28% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. JPMorgan’s peer Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is up by an even stronger 50% YTD. Let’s take a look at JPM’s recent performance and outlook. JPMorgan outperformed street expectations in the third quarter of FY 2024. The bank reported total revenues of $42.7 billion, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. Net interest income was slightly higher compared to last year, due to changes in the balance sheet mix, higher credit card balances, as well as wholesale deposits. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? Non-interest revenue, excluding the markets segment, grew by a strong 17% led by higher asset management fees as well as an improved investment banking performance. However, net income was down by about 2% compared to last year at $12.9 billion on account of higher provisions for credit losses. As an aside, why is VALE down 40% this year? See What’s Happening With VALE Stock? Admirably, JPM stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and 31% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what’s the outlook like for JPMorgan? Separately, see why Citi stock is also having a good year in Why Citi Stock Is Up 40% This Year. Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve in Q4 driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as JPMorgan. Republicans, who generally favor free markets, have won control of the Senate and the House of Representatives as well. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. While JPMorgan remains one of the highest quality names in the banking space, with considerable scale, we believe the stock is overvalued. JPM stock trades at over 2.5x tangible book value (company’s net assets, less goodwill) which is elevated in our view. Overall, at its current price of $245 per share, JPM is trading about 15% ahead of Trefis’ estimate for JPMorgan’s valuation.
