US stock market futures today struggled to gain momentum as Dow Jones and S&P 500 stalled, while Nasdaq futures dipped after June’s CPI report showed inflation rising faster than expected.

President Donald Trump’s new tariffs are also adding pressure on markets, as traders reassess inflation risks and policy direction.
