I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks Several of the large banking institutions in the US passed the Stress Tests imposed by the Federal Reserve. As a result, they announced their intentions to raise dividends and boost buyback allocations. I went through the list of increases from last week, and focused on the institutions that have a ten year track record of annual dividend increases: I also added ten year charts showcasing the trends in share price, quarterly earnings and quarterly dividends. In order to understand equity returns, you need to decompose them to their sources. Equity returns are a function of: 1. Dividend Yields 2. Earnings Per Share Growth 3. Change in valuation In the long-run, the first two items (dividends and earnings per share) are the so called fundamental sources of returns. They drive the total return over periods longer than say a decade. The changes of valuation matter the least in the very long-run. In the short-run however, for periods of five to ten years or less, valuation does matter a lot. This is why your returns would be much different if you bought a company at a starting yield of 4% versus a starting yield of 2%. That being said, rising earnings and dividends matter a lot too, because they provide the needed fuel behind great returns in the long-run. However, if you manage to acquire a good company at a discount, your potential returns will be higher. Visualizing the interplay between dividend yields, earnings per share growth and the changes in valuation showcases where returns have come from perfectly well. It also provides the perspective to determine where we are today, and also to potentially provide some markers as to where a potential future buy point could be set at.

Wall Street heavyweight JPMorgan (JPM) initiated coverage of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) with an underweight rating and an underwhelming $80 price target. The shares were trading 4.5% higher at around $189 at publication time. Circle is well positioned, the bank said, and its USDC stablecoin has an "early-mover advantage," with growing use cases in payments. "We think highly of the Circle management team and are confident in the outlook for outsized stablecoin and USDC growth," analysts led by Kenneth Worthington wrote. Still, the analysts see the company's market capitalization as elevated, and initiated coverage with an underweight rating. The stock priced at $31 a share in its initial public offering (IPO), and hit a record high of $299 last Monday. Other Wall Street analysts were not as bearish. Broker Bernstein initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a $230 price target, saying Circle was an "investor must-hold." "CRCL is building a market-leading digital dollar stablecoin network, with a strong regulatory edge, liquidity headstart and marquee distribution partnerships," analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Bernstein is also bullish about the wider stablecoin market, and expects total market cap to reach around $4 trillion in the next decade from $225 billion today. Rival broker Canaccord Genuity started coverage of Circle with a buy rating and a $247 price target. The firm's analysts view the issuer of USDC as "having many of the key attributes that could make it a long-term winner in this potentially very large and new market for truly digital money."
