Manage your account Donald Trump’s impending return to the White House has boosted some industrial sectors he has historically championed and others he advocated for during his campaign. It’s no surprise that Tesla (TSLA) stock has been soaring since Trump’s victory given Elon Musk’s endorsement and closeness to the president-elect in recent months. In the same vein, Trump Media (DJT), the social media platform founded by the former president, is on the rise following his victory. But Tesla and Trump Media shares aren’t the only ones expected to appreciate following Trump’s victory. Other sectors likely to benefit include banking, private prisons, cryptocurrency, and the non-renewable energy industry. Here’s a look at stocks poised to thrive in a Trump 2.0 era. Shares of JPMorgan (JPM) have seen significant growth since Election Day, fueled by investor optimism that Trump’s return to the White House will usher in a period of reduced regulation. The former and now-future president has long pushed for scaling back regulations across industries. For banks, that will ease what had been growing concerns over antitrust scrutiny and looming capital requirements that have slowed both potential investment banking and lending revenues. During his campaign, Trump promised to cut the corporate tax rate from 21% to as low as 15%. Moreover, he pledged to remove Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler on his first day in office. Currently, JPMorgan (JPM) shares are trading at $240, reflecting an increase of more than 9% over the past week and a nearly 40% rise for the year so far. Morgan Stanley (MS) shares have surged following Trump’s victory, driven by expectations of increased bank deregulation. Currently, the stock (MS) is trading at $132, reflecting a 14% gain over the past week and a nearly 40% rise year-to-date. A more lenient approach from Trump’s antitrust regulators could pave the way for a wave of deals that seemed uncertain under the current regulatory environment. Reuters has suggested that banks may benefit from faster approval timelines in the M&A landscape. Shares of credit card companies, like Capital One (COF), surged on optimism that a proposed merger with Discover Financial Services (DFS) could finally move forward under Trump’s leadership, as it has previously faced regulatory hurdles. Currently, Capital One (COF) stock is trading at $189, reflecting a 17% gain over the past week and a nearly 43% rise year-to-date. Shares of Discover Financial Services (DFS) have been surging since Trump’s win, hoping for a smooth merger with Capital One (COF). Currently, Discover (DFS) stock is trading at $180, reflecting a 20% gain over the past week and over 60% rise year-to-date. Shares of GEO Group Inc., a company specializing in the management of private prisons and detention centers, are climbing amid expectations that Trump’s policies will lead to increased detention of migrants entering the country illegally. Late Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Tom Homan, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and a proponent of the “zero tolerance” policy, will serve as his administration’s “border czar.” Currently, Geo Group (GEO) stock is trading at $26, reflecting an 81% gain over the past week and over 144% rise year-to-date. Shares of private prison company CoreCivic are surging post-election, as investors anticipate that a Trump administration will enforce stricter policies on immigrants entering the country illegally, driving demand for detention facilities. Currently, CoreCivic (CXW) stock is trading at $23, reflecting a 78% gain over the past week and over 65% rise year-to-date. This year, Trump emerged as a pro-crypto leader and pledged to create a Bitcoin reserve. The fact that crypto companies are thriving after his victory is not surprising. On Monday, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced it spent the first weeks of November accumulating Bitcoin. Between October 31 and November 10, the company purchased 27,200 Bitcoin for approximately $2.03 billion, at an average price of $74,463 per Bitcoin. This latest acquisition brings MicroStrategy’s total holdings to 279,420 Bitcoin, valued at nearly $24 billion at current market prices. Currently, MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock is trading at $340, reflecting a 45% gain over the past week and a 396% rise year-to-date. Coinbase (COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., was one of the leading crypto companies advocating for a crypto-friendly government. Following the confirmation of Trump’s victory, CEO Brian Armstrong took to X to share data indicating that the upcoming Senate and House of Representatives will have a majority pro-crypto congresspeople. Currently, Coinbase (COIN) stock is trading at $324, reflecting a 74% gain over the past week and a 106% rise year-to-date. During his speech at the Bitcoin conference, Trump said Bitcoin “is the steel of the future,” and he wants it to be “mined, minted, and made” on American soil. He met with executives from prominent crypto mining firms, listening to their challenges and discussing ways to enhance the industry’s growth. This pro-crypto stance has sent a surge of optimism through the industry, especially among major crypto mining companies like MARA Holdings Inc. (formerly Marathon Digital Holdings) (MARA). Currently, MARA Holdings (MARA) stock is trading at $25, reflecting a 56% gain over the past week and a 9% rise year-to-date. It is generally expected that Trump will favor policies that would benefit American oil companies. Non-renewable energy stocks, which provide services to the oil and energy industry, performed well after his victory. EQT (EQT), a natural gas producer that engages in hydrocarbon exploration and pipeline transport, has surged since Trump’s win. Currently, EQT (EQT) stock is trading at $44, reflecting a 44% gain over the past week and a 13% rise year-to-date. Baker Hughes (BKR) (BKR), an energy technology company, also surged after Trump’s victory in the election. Currently, Baker Hughes (BKR) is trading at $44, up 10% over the last week and up over 30% for the year so far. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) -Nadhmi al-Nasr, the long-time chief executive of the $500 billion NEOM mega-project at the heart of Saudi Arabia's drive to diversify away from oil, has departed, NEOM said on Tuesday without giving a reason. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MbS, has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into development projects through the kingdom's PIF sovereign wealth fund. NEOM, a Red Sea urban and industrial development nearly the size of Belgium due to house nearly nine million people, is central to the prince's Vision 2030 plan to create new engines of economic growth beyond oil.

Households on average saw inflation over the next year at 2.9%, down from 3.0% in September and the lowest estimate for near-term price increases in four years, according to the New York Fed's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations. Inflation expectations also fell at the three-year and five-year horizons - to 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively. Those are findings likely to be welcomed by the Fed as it works to keep price pressures contained and inflation expectations anchored while it continues its policy shift to interest rate decreases. The former national security adviser warned that this single trait "won't serve the country well." Here are some of the most outrageous things Pete Hegseth has said.

Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said President-elect Trump’s transition into the White House “is not going to look anything like it did in 2017.” “The level of sophistication on the issues is so far beyond what it was in 2017,” Mulvaney told “The Hill” host Blake Burman on NewsNation on Monday. “This… Lock up your dogs ‘cause Kristi Noem is back. Donald Trump confirmed on Tuesday that the South Dakota governor will serve as Homeland Security secretary in his upcoming administration. “Kristi has been very strong on Border Security,” Trump wrote in a statement. “I have known Kristi for years, and have worked with her on a wide variety of projects—she will be a great part of our mission to Make America Safe Again." "He will not have a huge economy if I have anything to say about it." Trump promised to cut Social Security taxes. Experts say the plan could slash benefits for low-income retirees and younger generations. In this left vision, the workers are half stupid — they know what to abandon, but don’t understand what they adopt when voting Republican. This stock is no flash in the pan. An attorney helping President-elect Donald Trump assemble his new administration warned career employees at the U.S. Justice Department on Monday that they could be fired if they tried to resist the Republican's agenda. His post on X came in response to a Politico article which reported that many Justice Department career attorneys -- civil servants who typically remain in their posts from administration to administration regardless of which party holds the White House -- are alarmed by what a second Trump presidency will mean. Trump won a second term in last Tuesday's presidential election. Looks like Donald Trump won’t have to fire Jack Smith after all. Elon Musk may be the richest person in the world, CEO of the most overvalued car company in the world and was rumored to functionally be Trump’s co-President. Yet, despite all of his financial success, he’s never been able to escape one simple truth: He is a deeply unlikable person. He can blame it on his reportedly self-diagnosed autism, but no one wants to be his friend including the Trump team, apparently, with some members telling the Daily Beast he’s the “guest who wouldn’t leave.” Jeffrey Toobin noted Tuesday that “there is a very boring” but “very important law” that could hamper Donald Trump's plans. Immigration attorneys report a surge in relocation inquiries following Donald Trump’s presidential victory as Americans explore international living options. The trend has prompted renewed attention to global housing markets and expatriate communities worldwide. “We received a rush of applications in the middle of the year, a sort of slowdown period from July to mid-October as many were traveling in the summer and others wanted to wait to see how things turned out with the election,” Steve Corbi Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson said she was “stunned” Tuesday by Donald Trump’s intention to nominate Fox & Friends host Pete Hegseth as his Secretary of Defense. “From silly diner interviews on Weekend Fox and Friends to Secretary of Defense?“ Carlson wrote on X. ”I never thought I’d say I’m stunned about any pick after the election but nominating Pete Hegseth for this incredibly important role? Yes he’s a veteran … and?" Others with ties to Fox were “stunned” as well, but in a more posi The company's shares fell about 4% in premarket trading. The stock is down 55% since Ernst & Young resigned as auditor in October after earlier flagging concerns about the company's governance, transparency and internal control over financial reporting. Earlier this month, the company said a special committee set up to probe the issues raised by EY in late July had not found evidence of fraud. Crude oil WTI futures saw a slight uptick following a significant phone call between President-elect Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. What Happened: At the time of writing, Crude Oil WTI Futures was up 0.18% at $70.25 per barrel on Monday during pre-market hours.

The move comes after Musk became one of Trump's staunchest supporters, and biggest financial backers, during the last stage of his presidential campaign The man who has emerged as the MAGA favourite to lead the Senate during Donald Trump’s second administration presided over one of the biggest medical frauds in American history. Donald Trump’s supporters suddenly seem a lot less sure of their decision. The MSNBC anchor mocked it as “absurd bluster from Trump, where he is trying to pretend he’s already in power.” House GOP leadership will speak Tuesday morning after clinching the majority in last week’s election, handing Republicans full control of Congress and the White House next year. Their remarks come as the House weighs whether to complete lawmakers’ annual funding work by the Dec. 20 deadline or punt it to next year, when President-elect Trump… House Republicans are worried they’re going to lose their majority thanks to Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks.

These companies have delivered 50 or more years of dividend increases. In the frenzy of election season, the Georgia congresswoman carved out some quiet time to increase positions in her favorite stocks. People face financial ruin from frivolous prosecution. To combat this, President Biden should preemptively pardon those who might be on a Trump enemies list. The rock star money manager is starting to roll with the rallying market. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Gates are among the very few members of the 12-digit club. Three Walmart heirs joined the elite group in September. The late night host brought out a “guest” that just might get under the president-elect’s skin. The GOP will now control both chambers of Congress and all three branches of government come January. Trump has chosen Pete Hegseth as his defense secretary. On a podcast last week, Hegseth said he didn't want US intervention forcing Putin's hand. President-elect Donald Trump will reinstate several executive orders from his first administration that were later revoked by President Joe Biden on his first day in office, his incoming chief of staff said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stands against the other best stocks under $100. Wall Street experts believe that mid-cap stocks might be well-placed for a strong run-up. As per Ryan Detrick (Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group), historically, midcaps outperform once the US Fed actually initiates cutting rates. According to him, the small and mid-caps are expected to surge up to 20% over the upcoming 12 months, far exceeding the large-cap counterparts. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs believes that mid-caps outperform large- and small-cap stocks over the 12 months after the first rate cut. As market experts continue to expect a soft landing, the investors might look for other options apart from the biggest companies. As per the earnings sight report from FactSet dated 1st November, the S&P 500 continues to report mixed results. The Q3 remained strong for risk assets and safe havens, with the US markets delivering an all-time closing high to finish Q3 and bonds posting positive returns, as per JPMorgan Asset Management. Overall, the S&P 500 gaining for 4th straight quarter (making 18 new highs), and the US Treasuries and corporate bonds rallying with the decline in yields dominated much of the movements in Q3 2024. The asset management firm also added that gold saw its biggest gain since Q1 2016 (thanks to the expectations of faster rate cuts) and China’s stimulus supported equity market returns. What is expected for Q4 2024 now? JPM believes that positive expected earnings growth, cooling inflation, easing policies of central banks, and firm job creation should help create a strong backdrop for risk assets. Wall Street analysts believe that mid-caps might be in a position to see strong growth moving forward. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per BofA’s Jill Carey Hall, mid-caps can be considered as the “best hedge” for the near term. According to Hall, the mid-caps have experienced better recent guidance and revision trends and have also surpassed the small caps on average in the downturn scenarios. Mid-caps can also act as a hedge against fewer-than-expected rate cuts, considering that small caps are rate-sensitive. According to Goldman’s Jenny Ma, the start of the rate-cut cycle remains a potential source of incremental equity demand and a boost to broader investor risk sentiment. Moreover, over the short term, mid-cap performance as compared to other segments is expected to be dependent on the strength of economic growth data, along with the pace of the easing cycle. As per Wells Fargo, mid-cap growth stocks are technically oversold as of now. Despite this, these stocks have a significant scope to outperform. It also added that stability in their earnings, risk, liquidity, and balance sheet appear to be more attractive as compared to small caps. With these trends in mind, let’s take a look at the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. To list the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In, we first used a screener to extract stocks trading under $100. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A professional financial analyst studying data on a computer, illustrating the company's index investment decisions. Stock Price as of November 6: $96.08 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of coffee. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)’s brand strength stems from its pricing power, attractive unit-level economics, and successful international replication. Wall Street remains optimistic about the leadership change. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) brought in Brian Niccol as its new Chairman and CEO. Analysts opine that his experience in fueling operational efficiencies, improving marketing strategies, and fostering product innovation should be a perfect fit for the company’s current needs. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will continue to benefit from a healthy brand presence and customer loyalty throughout various generational cohorts. Its focus on improving throughput, enhancing digital marketing, and driving product innovation appears to be critical for maintaining and strengthening its competitive edge. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been emphasizing product innovation as a critical driver of customer interest and sales growth. The company’s initiatives which are focused on streamlining operations, optimizing store formats, and leveraging technology for improved efficiency are expected to yield substantial benefits. Analysts at Morgan Stanley increased their price target on the shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) from $98.00 to $115.00, giving it an “Overweight” rating on 16th October. ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Similarly, we took advantage of a business reset at Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the third quarter to initiate a position in the global coffee retailer. A confluence of factors, including degraded store-level operations and long consumer wait times, consumer fatigue with high prices and weakening engagement among occasional Starbucks customers has led to declining U.S. same-store sales growth. While the path ahead will likely require reinvestment back into the business, there are many merits to Starbucks’ business including its strong brand name and category leading market position. In response to recent challenges, Starbucks has appointed change-agent CEO Brian Niccol, who we know from the Strategy’s ownership of Chipotle Mexican Grill during its turnaround. Niccol has a successful track record of investing in product innovation and fixing execution issues, which we believe are the primary challenges facing Starbucks today. Starbucks represents the kind of successful playbook we have executed on historically – focusing on high-quality businesses and brands while being disciplined around the entry point into investments with attractive risk-reward opportunities.” Overall, SBUX ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks under $100 to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SBUX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

He expects shares to rise to $154 over the next 12 months. The stock stood at roughly $133 Friday morning. JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Doug Anmuth also has a Neutral rating on the stock and sees shares hitting $142 over the next year. Anmuth said in a note to investors Friday morning “Overall, we are encouraged by improving demand trends & ABNB’s early progress toward expanding beyond the core, but expect growth sustainability to remain the biggest pushback.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) soared to new intraday highs on Friday, crossing the 44,000 level. The blue-chip index was up nearly 0.7%, or about 290 points. Ironically, AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA), which joined the Dow on Friday, was lower by about 1% during the session. The major average is up about 28% year to date. Tesla (TSLA) hit $1 trillion in market cap on Friday as shares of the electric vehicle giant soared as much as 7%. The stock has been on fire this week following Donald Trump's White House victory. CEO Elon Musk bet big on Trump, with more than $130 million in political support. The question for investors is whether the financial commitments will benefit Tesla. On Friday, Tesla shares were trading at their highest level since March 22. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) leaped 10% and was briefly halted for volatility after Donald Trump said he would not sell his shares in the company, the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. Trump, who made the announcement on his Truth Social account, maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT. At current levels of around $30 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of about $6.5 billion, giving the president-elect a stake worth around $3.9 billion. Shares in the company have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. On Thursday, the stock fell nearly 23% to reverse the gains it enjoyed the day prior as Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. But with Friday's moves to the upside, the stock is down just 2% over the past five days, although shares have rallied by more than 60% in the past month. Read more here. Americans are feeling increasingly better about the short-term path for inflation. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed consumers expect inflation to sit at 2.6% in a year, a decrease from last month's expectation of 2.7%. November's reading is the lowest since December 2020 and is within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation did tick higher, though, rising to 3.1% from 3% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 73, up from 71 in October. Interviews for the survey concluded on Monday and therefore don't capture any reactions to election results. US stocks flirted with their record highs on Friday following the latest rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve. Market euphoria following a Trump White House victory seemed to drift as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was little changed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.3% On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis point cut, a move widely anticipated by the markets. And on Friday AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) replaced semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) as one of the Dow's 30 components. The new addition should give the blue-chip index an added boost. Intel shares are down roughly 45% year to date while Nvidia is up more than 200%. Paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also replaced Dow Inc. (DOW) as a component of the major average.

By Daniel Urbina Summary Over the recent months, Bank of America (BAC, Financial) has been in the headlines as legendary investor Warren Buffett sold many of his shares in the North Carolinian bank. With this, Buffett owns less than 10% of the company, allowing him to refrain from reporting his stock transactions from now on. Should retail investors blindly follow Buffett's actions and avoid initiating a position or trimming positions in Bank of America's stock? The answer is no. First, Buffett has many potential reasons to sell the stock, and multiple bearish transactions do not constitute a pessimistic outlook on the stock alone. For example, the sale could be attributed to a portfolio rebalancing. Second, when observing Berkshire's positions, Bank of America represents the second largest holding, and one can't be bearish on a company while holding more than $40 billion in it. Setting Buffett aside, let me explain why Bank of America's current landscape represents an opportunity for investors to be bullish on the stock. The primary source of income for money center banks is usually net interest income from consumer banking, which is what banks earn from lending products after paying depositors and wholesale funders. In Q1 of 2022, a hawkish Fed allowed banks to increase their net interest income as loan demand was still high, and the yields earned were generally higher. Nonetheless, this only lasted for part of the rate hike period as higher interest rates began to make loan originations less appealing. In addition, depositors found money market yields attractive and shifted sight deposits towards term deposits, which are a more expensive funding source for banks. This condition ultimately translated into lower gains from net interest income, and Bank of America wasn't the exception. As illustrated above, the net interest income from the Bank of America Consumer Banking segment began to fall sequentially from Q1 of 2023. Yet, after the Fed's first rate cut, the most recent quarter finally saw a net interest income gain after multiple consecutive drops. With a dovish monetary policy, Bank of America is in an excellent spot to call Q2 of 2024 the net interest income trough and substantially gain from these tailwinds in 2025. Let me explain why. In addition, since the FED's first rate cut in September, the yield curve has steepened as longer-term yields have gained roughly 105 bps. This bull steepener is the best macro scenario for a bank as there are more opportunities for maturity transformation as banks can borrow cheaper on short maturities and lend at higher rates in longer maturities. It is worth mentioning that management had been expecting a net interest income recovery in Q3 of 2024 for over a year. Surprisingly, they hit the estimate at the exact time they expected it. Regarding that, Bank of America's CEO Brian Moynihan had this to say in the most recent earnings call. "Four quarters ago, we called that a bottom would occur in our net interest income in the second quarter of 2024. Even with a rate environment that has bounced around quite a bit since we said that we got it right. As we expected then, NII indeed troughed in the quarter two. NII grew 2% this quarter and Alastair will note later, we expect NII to grow again in quarter four, even as the market expects two more rate cuts in quarter four." Brian Moynihan, Bank of America CEO. Furthermore, during the conference call, management remained optimistic about the bank's net interest income trajectory and called for a sequential rise once again in Q4 of 2024. "With regard to a forward view of NII, there are obviously several variables at play in the Q4, and we still expect Q4 NII to grow" Alastair Borthwick, CFO. Money center banks such as Bank of America are heavily diversified. Although net interest income tends to be their main source of revenue, other non-interest income, such as investment banking, trading, wealth and asset management, are also factors for top-line growth. The bank has been doing well within these categories, particularly with trading and asset management, due to markets at an all-time high and significant corporate volume in trading activity. Despite investment banking having strongly recovered from 2022 lows, deal activity remains below historical averages, and rate cuts induce more volume within these areas of the bank. For example, with cheaper interest rates, banks are more likely to increase their leverage and conduct buyouts due to higher expected internal rates of return. Nevertheless, the initial 50 bps rate cut from the FED has yet to improve the landscape as long-term rates haven't fallen, and this activity is dependent on longer-term rates. Yet, the outlook for M&A and other investment banking activity is for volumes to increase to historical levels after a prolonged time of high interest rates. The most appalling part of a bullish investment thesis on Bank of America is its valuation. As commented, the bank sits at a potential turning point on its net interest income, and the outlook from the company's side is for the backdrop to improve. Nonetheless, the stock wouldn't be attractive if the bank traded at 3.00x price-to-tangible book value while exhibiting a return on average tangible common shareholders' equity of 12.8%. Luckily for investors, this is not the case. Based on the most recent price-to-tangible book value per share of $26.25 and a closing price of $42.62, Bank of America's stock trades at 1.62x price-to-tangible book, which is unarguably a decent valuation, considering that the 5-year average of the price-to-tangible book multiple is around the corner at 1.60x. Simultaneously, competitor JPMorgan (JPM) trades considerably higher at over 2.3x price-to-tangible book value. In addition, the dividend yield, at 2.30%, is also at its five-year average. With a dividend increase momentum, the current prices set an excellent opportunity for income investors who are seeking a safe and growing dividend despite the moderate value of the dividend yield. Bank of America Provision for Credit Losses Over the past quarters, the provisions for Bank of America's credit losses have increased slightly. Considering that the loan portfolio has stayed basically flat over the year, the bank's cost of risk has risen. Although the bank's asset quality remains resilient, things in the economy could always unfold. If a soft landing does not materialize, the bullish thesis on Bank of America is nullified due to a bank's dependence on economic and credit cycles. In addition, although the valuation remains high, the truth is like the sun; you can't hide it with just one finger. In this case, the stock has risen more than 60% over the past year, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 and boosting optimism among investors. Usually, when market sentiment is high, reactions to negative news amplify, and the stock tends to drop more than it should. Yet, positive financials and high market sentiment are the formula for a stock to gain excess returns. To conclude, due to the net interest income recovery outlook, Bank of America's stock is well positioned to continue gaining solid market performances that appeal to investors. A fair valuation allows the stock to continue being attractive to investors despite the enormous price gain of the past year. Finally, investors shouldn't blindly follow actions from legendary investors, even more so when a bullish thesis is evident. Therefore, due to all these conditions, Bank of America is a stock that represents an opportunity in 2025. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.
