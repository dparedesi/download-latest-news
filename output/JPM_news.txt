Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to "overweight" from "neutral" and raised its price target to $404, citing new monetization opportunities and reduced risks that make the crypto exchange appear more attractive compared to its peers. The shares were about 4% higher in early trading, around $332. The bank highlighted two key catalysts: a potential Base token and enhanced USDC payouts. JPMorgan analysts said that Coinbase is exploring a token for Base, its Layer 2 blockchain launched in August 2023, which has grown into one of the largest in the ecosystem. A token could allow Coinbase to capture more of Base‚Äôs growth, with the bank estimating a possible $12 billion to $34 billion market cap and up to $12 billion in value accruing to Coinbase. The move, JPMorgan said, could spur development, community participation and long-term infrastructure growth. The bank's analysts also noted Coinbase‚Äôs efforts to better monetize USDC by offering yields to customers through its Coinbase One subscription service. By segmenting users and offering 4% returns to subscribers, Coinbase could add about $1 per share in annual earnings, JPMorgan said. While competition from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remains a risk, the analysts said market share between DEXs and centralized exchanges has stabilized. It added that Coinbase‚Äôs integrated model, spanning brokerage, market making, exchange and custody, should help sustain profitability even if fees decline. JPMorgan valued Coinbase at 50 times projected 2027 earnings, factoring in $4 billion from a potential Base token, and set a December 2026 price target of $404.

Title: Wall Street Banks Come to the ‚ÄúRescue‚Äù of Milei‚Äôs Argentina Just Days Before Make-or-Break Elections

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon landed in Buenos Aires this week to attend an event the Wall Street lender is holding, precisely at a time that the bank is in negotiations to arrange a $20 billion loan for the Argentine government. The timing was apparently pure coincidence, given the event was organised long before talk of a rescue package, reports Bloomberg: [B]ut it means some of the bank‚Äôs top brass will be on the ground just as doubts grow that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be able to pull off the second half of his rescue package for the Javier Milei government: a $20 billion bank-led loan. Other Wall Street banks involved include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. If they were to activate credit lines for Argentina, it would bolster the USD 20 billion currency swap that was formalised on Monday, notes Bloomberg. Time is of the essence, however, given the country will vote in mid-term legislative elections on Sunday and the country‚Äôs peso continues to sink despite the Trump administration‚Äôs rescue package. There‚Äôs a lot riding on the results, including that rescue package: BREAKING: In a shocking moment, Trump appears to engage in foreign election interference, saying the U.S. will only give Argentina foreign aid if his pal Milei wins. "If he loses, we will not be generous with Argentina." Extreme corruption.pic.twitter.com/RJ1DjFMgm8 ‚Äî Really American üá∫üá∏ (@ReallyAmerican1) October 14, 2025 Dimon will be joined on his visit by the current joint chairman of JP Morgan‚Äôs International Council, Tony Blair, who will be taking a few days out from his new role as ‚Äúmodern-day high commissioner‚Äù of Gaza, and former US Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice, who also sits on the council. On the weekend, he will take part in a polo tournament. Before that, Dimon is expected to meet with members of Milei‚Äôs senior economic team during his stay. He should receive a warm welcome considering all four of them, including Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank Governor Santiago Busilli, are former JP Morgan Chase executives. The following photo has been doing the rounds in recent days. Argentina's right-wing libertarian government is run by Wall Street, both indirectly and directly. President Javier Milei's minister & vice minister of the economy, and the president & vice president of the central bank, all previously worked for JPMorgan, the largest US bank. https://t.co/k9yqKikxge pic.twitter.com/1LUSXhrq3O ‚Äî Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) October 21, 2025 What were the odds of all four of them having previously worked for the same New York-based mega lender whose operations in Argentina are apparently expanding quite nicely right now? That same bank is now helping the Milei government carry out a sovereign debt buyback operation ostensibly aimed at ‚Äúreducing the country‚Äôs cost of financing and strengthening investment in education‚Äù? An Oligarch‚Äôs Libertarian It was Milei‚Äôs appointment of Caputo and Bausili back in December 2023 that was the obvious tell that the fix was once again in, that Milei‚Äôs government was not going to honour his main electoral pledges to abolish Argentina‚Äôs central bank or adopt the dollar. As Yannis Varoufakis argues in an excellent piece for Unherd (and as we‚Äôve been arguing for the past two years), Milei is not a libertarian by any means but is instead beholden to Argentina‚Äôs oligarchy: Milei never really broke with Argentina‚Äôs sad oligarchic practices of the past. He merely rebranded a type of heist practised by a long succession of his predecessors ‚Äî from Peronist Carlos Menem and anti-Peronist Fernando de la R√∫a to hapless Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√°, whose presidency lasted a mere seven days, and, more recently, neoliberal Mauricio Macri who now supports Milei. While Milei used libertarian narratives successfully to distance himself from these people, his actual policies fail the most important libertarian litmus test. Before you, dear reader, dismiss me as a Marxist (that I admittedly am) intent on dismissing a political opponent‚Äôs success as a dismal failure (something I avoid like a mortal sin), let me put it to you in simple, libertarian terms. If you (unlike me) truly believe in the markets‚Äô superior wisdom, and want to rid Argentina of political constraints placed on the market mechanism, which market do you liberate first? The money market, surely. Which price distortion do you drive your chainsaw through first? The fixed (or bounded) exchange rate, unquestionably. And what is the last thing you do? Precisely what Milei did: borrow zillions of dollars, pile them up on top of an already unbearable heap of public debt, to prevent the money market from choosing freely the exchange rate of your currency. Defending a currency as weak as the peso for almost two years is, of course, a fool‚Äôs errand, and the results have been depressingly familiar. In less than two years, the Milei government has burnt through tens of billions of dollars of foreign exchange reserves in a futile bid to keep the peso artificially high and, by extension, inflation artificially low. It has brought misery for the man in the street while making a mint for financial speculators. Yes, Milei‚Äôs austerity has reduced inflation, but at the cost of smothering economic activity for two long years and squandering the country‚Äôs limited currency reserves. It is also utterly unsustainable. Everyone knows the moment the elections are over, the government will once again devalue the peso, sending inflation soaring once again ‚Äî that‚Äôs why everyone is buying dollars despite the US‚Äô direct support of the peso. To avert an all-out currency collapse, the Milei government has needed not one, but two, massive $40 billion bailouts in the space of just six months ‚Äî the first from the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank, the other from the US Treasury Department‚Äôs Exchange Stabilisation Fund and Wall Street Banks. The half-lives of the financial interventions are growing dangerously short. From Benign Neglect to Malign Meddling Both of these bailouts came with big strings attached, but it is the latter that has the most onerous terms ‚Äî including Trump‚Äôs exhortation to Argentine voters to choose the right party in Sunday‚Äôs election. Otherwise, he warns, the bailout funds will be withdrawn, tipping Argentina‚Äôs economy over the edge. This, lest we forget, is occurring at the same time that the US is bombing speedboats into smithereens in both the Caribbean and the Pacific while beating the drums of war for direct military intervention in Venezuela. In recent days, it has threatened ‚Äúvery serious actions‚Äù against Colombia‚Äôs left-leaning governments as well as crippling tariffs against Nicaragua. Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out yet another lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO). Yet again, the now-deceased terrorists were engaged in narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific. The‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/PEaKmakivD ‚Äî Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (@SecWar) October 23, 2025 After two decades of benign neglect of Latin America (while it bombed the Middle East, Libya and Afghanistan to pieces), the US is back to its traditional practice of malign meddling in its resource-rich ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù. The old policy of plata o plomo (silver or lead) is back on the agenda as the Trump administration tries to drive a wedge between Latin America and China. Take the money or take a bullet: that is the option on offer. This is not a new thing, of course. The US has been meddling in Latin America for nigh on two centuries. As Chomsky told the British journalist Seamus Milne back in 2009, US foreign policy has long been ‚Äústraight out of the mafia‚Äù: [S]ince government officials first formulated plans for a ‚Äúgrand area‚Äù strategy for US global domination in the early 1940s, successive administrations have been guided by a ‚Äúgodfather principle, straight out of the mafia: that defiance cannot be tolerated. It‚Äôs a major feature of state policy.‚Äù ‚ÄúSuccessful defiance‚Äù has to be punished, even where it damages business interests, as in the economic blockade of Cuba ‚Äì in case ‚Äúthe contagion spreads‚Äù. Will Trump‚Äôs overt election meddling and outright extortion practices concentrate the minds of Argentine voters, helping to tip the balance in Milei‚Äôs favour this Sunday? It‚Äôs unlikely but you never know. Milei still has millions of fanboys and girls (despite scamming thousands of them in his Libra meme coin con) and the opposition is still broadly reviled. However, Trump‚Äôs meddling is just as likely, if not more so, to have the opposite of the intended effect. A large majority of Argentines (60%) already have a negative image of Donald J Trump while 56% have a negative image of the United States overall, according to a poll conducted for Bloomberg in April. What‚Äôs more, the last six months of economic crisis and non-stop scandals have taken their toll on Milei‚Äôs approval ratings. The following exchange, from a recent interview of Milei on a friendly news program by Eduardo Feinmann, a presenter with a strong pro-government bias, shows just how quickly Milei‚Äôs carefully crafted image as an expert on economic matters is unravelling: Presenter: Eighty percent of Argentineans barely make it to the end of the month, and 60 to 70% of them only make it to the 20th of the month. Milei: How do you want me to fix that? How can I get money to the people? Interviewer: You are the economist. You are the expert in economic growth with or without money. In recent days, even with make-or-break elections looming, an allegedly heavily medicated Milei has refused to do any more interviews with the media, presumably at the insistence of his campaign team. As Luis Majul, another pro-government news presenter put it (emphasis my own), ‚ÄúMilei was going to do an interview (with us) but he took the decision not to come on in case there were questions he could not answer, which seems reasonable to me.‚Äù An analysts‚Äô report published by JP Morgan notes that the markets are already discounting a bad election result for Milei‚Äôs ruling Libertad Avanza party, which will make it even harder for the government to govern. However, the analysts do not rule out a sharp rebound in Argentine stocks from next week if the result exceeds expectations. As El Pa√≠s reported a month ago, Argentina‚Äôs stock market is the world‚Äôs worst performer in 2025. Analysts from Wells Fargo have warned that the current exchange bands scheme ‚Äúdoes not seem sustainable‚Äù and have predicted a further depreciation in the peso of close to 30% by the end of 2026 ‚Äî the largest among all emerging currencies analysed. They also cautioned that the US Treasury‚Äôs support may offer a few days of stability ‚Äì or even strength ‚Äì for the Argentine peso, but it does not constitute a sustainable exchange rate policy. In the meantime, the private sector-led rescue agreement still faces obstacles. The banks involved ‚Äî including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup ‚Äî are demanding clear guarantees to back the loan, either from the US Treasury or the Argentine State itself. From Perfil (translated by yours truly): At the crux of the negotiations is the question of who will serve as guarantor of the loan: the Argentine government or the US Treasury itself. Banks are pushing for tangible backing, whether with assets, reserves or official coverage from Washington, that minimizes the risk of losses. In this context, The Wall Street Journal points out that Argentina could offer sovereign bonds or future tax revenues as collateral, although those options are considered unviable. Local bonds are worth well below their face value, and compromising future collections could generate political rejection within the country. Throughout history, this type of operation had solid collateral. In 1995, for example, Mexico guaranteed a $20 billion loan with oil exports during the so-called ‚ÄúTequila Crisis.‚Äù By contrast, the currency swap between the Treasury and Argentina, which is also part of the $40 billion package, does not legally require collateral, increasing risks for the U.S. Treasury. At the same time, the Trump administration is facing a gathering backlash from its MAGA base for trying to rescue Argentina, a major agricultural competitor, while the economic pain from Trump‚Äôs tariffs intensifies. üö® TRUMP: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll buy Argentine beef.‚Äù Asked what he‚Äôd tell U.S. ranchers losing their farms, he said: ‚ÄúArgentina is fighting for its life‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre dying.‚Äù So are our ranchers, 77 go under every single day. America First apparently ends where the steak begins. pic.twitter.com/sbPImhQc6x ‚Äî Brian Allen (@allenanalysis) October 21, 2025 Trump‚Äôs recent call to buy beef from Argentina could be, if you‚Äôll excuse the pun, the final straw for some of his America-first voters, and is heaping pressure on Republican lawmakers. From Fortune: Trump proposed on Sunday that the U.S. could purchase beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices for American consumers. Beef costs have ballooned as much as 12% in the past year. The suggestion was met with exasperation from U.S. cattle ranchers, who argued the move would disrupt the free market and introduce unnecessary risk factors to domestic beef supply. ‚ÄúThis plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,‚Äù National Cattlemen‚Äôs Beef Association CEO Colin Woodall said in a statement on Monday‚Ä¶ A potential intervention with Argentina would come just as the U.S. cattle industry was beginning to recover from a dismal 2024, in which it saw its smallest herd since 1951, a result of severe droughts withering pastures and hiking up livestock feed costs. U.S. beef imports have also shrunk due to a ban on Mexican beef in an effort to prevent the spread of screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite found in cattle across the border‚Ä¶ Cattle ranchers join the chorus of soybean farmers, who have been outspoken about the impact Trump‚Äôs ties with Argentina have on the soybean industry. Amid proposals to offer financial assistance to Argentina last month, the South American country also dropped several export taxes as an effort to stabilize its economy‚Äîincluding its soybean tax. As a result, China, which previously purchased about a quarter U.S.‚Äôs soybean exports, ordered several cargoes of the crop. China has not ordered U.S. soybeans since May. ‚ÄúThe frustration is overwhelming,‚Äù the American Soybean Association (ASA) President Caleb Ragland said in a statement last month. ‚ÄúThe farm economy is suffering while our competitors supplant the United States in the biggest soybean import market in the world. Jamie Dimon has a different take, joking that Argentina has ‚Äúprofessionals, land, education‚Ä¶ even meet.‚Äù On the political level, he remarked that Argentina has a real opportunity to become a strategic partner of Washington. ‚ÄúArgentina should be an ally of the United States; Trump and Milei are close, and I celebrate that effort to shorten the distance.‚Äù Dimon also contrasted the US presence in Latin America to China‚Äôs ‚ÄúBelt and Road‚Äù initiative promoted by China, expressing concern about Washington‚Äôs lack of a clear strategy to boost economic development in the region. (NC: When has it ever done that?) By contrast, the Chinese initiative ‚Äî based on free trade, investment in infrastructure and international cooperation ‚Äî has massively strengthened Beijing‚Äôs influence in Latin America. This is one of the reasons why the US is so keen to prop up the Milei government, even if it risks alienating a core section of Trump‚Äôs electoral base: the potential advantages of ‚Äúdriving a wedge between Argentina and China‚Äù (as the WSJ puts it) outweigh the political and economic costs. At least that‚Äôs the calculation. In the following interview with Democracy Now, the Argentine author and journalist Pablo Calvi offers three possible explanations for Washington‚Äôs support of the Milei government: geopolitics (removing China from the equation as much as possible); the interests of Trump-adjacent tech bros in Argentina, including Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Sam Altman; and the ideological affinity between Trump and Milei. Trump's $20 billion bailout for Argentina is meant to bolster his right-wing ally President Javier Milei, but the plan "could backfire" for both leaders, says journalist @plcalvi. Argentina is holding legislative elections later this month. pic.twitter.com/Ap0L5Rtoml ‚Äî Democracy Now! (@democracynow) October 16, 2025 One other possible explanation that Calvi doesn‚Äôt mention is the personal and business interests of US Treasury Secretary (and former hedge fund manager) Scott Bessent. As the NYT reported a couple of weeks ago, some hedge fund managers, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both former colleagues of Bessent at Soros Asset Management, bet large on Argentina and will indirectly benefit from a financial rescue of Argentine assets. Another major beneficiary will be the IMF, given Argentina now owes the Fund close to $60 billion. Another Argentine default, which may be inevitable anyway, could cause the institution serious embarrassment given that both of the last two bailouts, in 2018 and April 2025, were strongly opposed by senior members at the Fund, some of whom were even prepared to sacrifice their jobs rather than sign along the dotted line. Another source of embarrassment for the Fund: Just a reminder that the IMF's market access debt sustainability framework and in particularly its medium term assessment doesn't use external debt or fx reserves as analytic variables ‚Äî it is an "it is all fiscal" framework. ‚Äî Brad Setser (@Brad_Setser) October 22, 2025 Neither the people of Argentina nor the people of the United States stand to benefit from this bailout. As reader Rabid Gandhi pointed out in a comment to Curro‚Äôs post yesterday on Latin America, the money will ‚Äúbarely even touch Argentine soil before being whisked away to the Caymans accounts of various hedgies and oligarchs, some of them nominally Argentines, others not even that‚Äù: When this capital flight occurs, once again as it always has in the past, it will not be a surprise to Messers Bessent, Trump, Caputo‚Ä¶, because it is by design‚Ä¶ What Argentina, the 45 million Argentines, will be getting as their ‚Äòreward‚Äô is a debt in USD, a central bank bereft of reserves and the concomitant austerity/cuts to social services that inevitably follow. With friends like these‚Ä¶ So, this leaves us with one final question: what will the Wall Street banks be asking for as collateral for its $20 billion loan? Or put another way, what does Argentina have left to plunder? The last time the US Treasury used ESF funds to bail out another country, it was for Mexico during the 1994-5 Tequila Crisis. Not only are the Mexican people still paying off the debt for that bailout today, 27 years later, but the total amount outstanding has almost doubled in size despite the fact that the country has already paid $200 billion pesos more than the principal: the magical wonders of compound interest. In its bailout of Mexico, the US government made sure the Mexican government put up as collateral for the loan the revenues from oil exports of Mexico‚Äôs state-owned oil company, Pemex. Will the Wall Street banks be demanding the same sort of treatment from Argentina‚Äôs state-owned company YPF? In its Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) field, Argentina boasts the world‚Äôs fourth largest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except China. Such a move could be complicated, however, by a ruling issued a few months ago by US federal judge Loretta Preska ‚Äî yes, the same judge who persecuted US lawyer Steven Donziger for daring to represent the people of Ecuador against Chevron ‚Äî ordering the Milei government to hand over 51% of YPF to firms affected by the oil firm‚Äôs 2012 nationalisation. That ruling has been put on hold by a US appeal court but is hanging over Argentina like a sword of Damocles. Alternatively, the Milei government could be asked to put up Argentina‚Äôs vast lithium deposits, the second largest in the world, as collateral, or even its uranium deposits. The negotiations between the Milei government and the US Treasury Department have reportedly included demands to restrict Chinese access to critical resources and prioritise agreements with U.S. companies in infrastructure and telecommunications. The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina‚Äôs four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come ‚Äî unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei‚Äôs party on Sunday. If that were to happen, Milei would effectively be stripped of the ability to rule by decree and veto, as he has done for the best part of the past two years. In which case, Bessent‚Äôs rescue package will presumably be withheld. And in that case, all bets are off. Austerity and borrowing money in a foreign currency‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like the economic version of getting into a land war in Asia. Is there Spanish translation of Mark Blyth? And is there an equivalent of his book on national governments borrowing in a currency they don‚Äôt control? Varoufakis certainly has first hand experience, with Greece and the Euro. looks like a target rich environment re: ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs recent call to buy beef from Argentina could be,‚Ä¶:‚Äù It‚Äôs a gift to Amazon and Walmart, imo, both selling beef and looking for the cheapest buy-price for themselves to sell at the greatest profit to consumers. The Big Four Just Became Five: Walmart Quietly Captures the Beef Chain https://beefnews.org/the-big-four-just-became-five-walmart-quietly-captures-the-beef-chain/ Regarding the final question ‚Äì I‚Äôm no expert in bond markets, but is it possible this is being done with the expectation that Argentina won‚Äôt be able to pay? Then Paul Singer of some other vulture capitalist can come in and swoop them up for pennies on the dollar. Could be. See this Mother Jones magazine article. https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/trump-argentina-bailout-hedge-fund-billionaire-rob-citrone-scott-bessent/ Oh, and, what is guaranteeing the repayment by Argentina to the US Banks? The US govt! That means US taxpayers. The US Banks won‚Äôt take any loss. On the topic of the risks the US taxpayer may be forced to bear, one of the best articles I‚Äôve come across so far is one by Sebastian Pellejero, for Reuters Breaking Views (Spanish language edition). He points out that: 1) These drastic measures are effectively a band-aid to help President Javier Milei get through the difficult midterm elections. Even if they work, Washington may be forced to do more. 2) The cash available in the Treasury‚Äôs Exchange Stabilization Fund is not unlimited by any means, spread out as it is among the coffers of the International Monetary Fund, foreign exchange reserves and previous commitments, leaving only $23 billion in direct assets of the US government, as of August. 3) The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic‚Äôs provisions are now dangerously scarce: around $13 billion, according to the Financial Times. By contrast, Argentina has a short-term foreign currency debt of more than $95 billion. A $20 billion International Monetary Fund loan, approved in April, was supposed to bolster those buffers. However, in August, Argentina had not reached its reserve accumulation target. 4) If Milei‚Äôs party loses in Sunday‚Äôs election, the United States will have financed a failed economic experiment and will be left holding billions (or more like trillions) of pesos that will collapse in value as soon as market confidence disappears, mainly to the benefit of the lenders who have been paid in full in the interim. 5) Even if Milei‚Äôs party wins, the vicious cycle will remain intact, inviting further interventions. There could be pressure to monetise more stabilization fund assets. And leaders of other countries aligned with the Trump White House will see that Uncle Sam can be counted on to lend a helping hand if and whenever necessary. Talk about moral hazard‚Ä¶ As I read this thorough and well-written article, Nick, I just continued to shake my head back and forth in wonder and dismay. I‚Äôm pretty cynical, but even then, I miss half the connections and schemes. The Due Dissidence guys likened this to the way mobsters drain money from businesses, finally torching them for the insurance money. These billionaires are really, really confident in their suppression technologies. No wonder the first question they asked Rushkoff was how they could insure the loyalty of pilots, security guards, etc. I think the one thing these billionaire sociopaths will never have is true human loyalty. They will have to program it, I guess. Thanks. And thanks for the link to the archived NYT article. The currency swap provided by the US, and the loans made by US banks, are both $20 billion. That has to be just coincidence. That is very good point. So none of this money will go to pay off IMF loan Remember, Austrian economics cannot be failed. Only the government that instills it can fail it. ‚ÄúThe Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina‚Äôs four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come ‚Äî unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei‚Äôs party on Sunday.‚Äù It is always about the future grift, isn‚Äôt it. Perhaps there will be a US company lining up to purchase Argentinian public infrastructure at pennies on the dollar? Your email address will not be published.
