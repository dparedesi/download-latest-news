Subscribe here to receive future editions. I'm back in New York City after spending nearly a week in San Francisco for the annual JPMorgan Health Care Conference – the largest gathering in the U.S. of biotech and pharma execs, investors and analysts (and health reporters, of course). The week featured questions about the incoming Trump administration, updates on business outlooks and drug portfolios, heightened security on the ground and, for the first time in recent memory, sunny weather in San Francisco. The news kept coming all week, even after the conference ended mid-Thursday. The Biden administration on Friday announced the next 15 drugs included in Medicare price negotiations, which include Novo Nordisk's blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic and its obesity counterpart Wegovy. But after companies announced a handful of deals last week, I'll zero in on some takeaways for M&A activity in the industry in 2025. M&A appears to be off to a good start this year. But the question is whether it will last. Some of the deals announced during the conference boosted optimism, particularly Johnson & Johnson's proposed $14.6 billion buyout of Intra-Cellular Therapies. That appears to be the biggest transaction we've seen in the pharmaceutical industry since 2023. That agreement came amid a wave of smaller deals from GSK, Eli Lilly and lesser known radiopharmaceutical companies. "That's five deals in one and a half business days," Stifel analyst Tim Opler said in an email to clients last week. "This is going to be a very different year for M&A than 2024." Last year was marked by smaller and smarter deals in the pharmaceutical industry, according to EY's M&A Firepower report released last week. Big pharma sought deals with lower price tags for products and companies in earlier development, which could pay off more handsomely in the long run. While this year has started off with more activity, the report pointed to potential restraints on M&A in 2025: Ongoing margin pressure on biopharma companies is still "reducing the appetite for big spending," and the most prized acquisition targets in the industry are still commanding high premiums in the market, among other factors that could dampen transactions. That tracks for some large pharma companies. During a presentation at the conference after J&J announced its Intra-Cellular Therapies deal, J&J CEO Joaquin Duato said "for us, larger deals are more outliers." "The majority of the value that we create is through smaller deals and partnerships where we can use our scale," Duato said, pointing to the 75 smaller deals that J&J inked last year. But the EY report said there are "strong structural reasons to expect a return to dealmaking," including the industry's $1.3 trillion in dealmaking "firepower," which refers to the ability to fund transactions and make deals. Large pharma companies are also bracing for upcoming drug patent expirations that could wipe out $300 billion in revenues by 2028, putting more pressure on them to offset losses with new products. Pfizer, for example, faces a wave of patent losses over the next few years that could threaten some $17 billion to $18 billion in annual sales, the company's CEO Albert Bourla said during a presentation at the conference. But Bourla said the company's series of deals in recent years, such as its acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen, should help offset those losses. The Trump administration could also offer "significant tailwinds" to the industry by cutting corporate taxes or changing FTC policy "as part of a general deregulatory shift," according to the EY report. But we'll have to see how this all plays out later this year. Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com. Now that JPM has come to a close, 2025 is officially underway for the health-care sector. But we can't dive into the year ahead without first taking a look at the venture funding landscape for digital health in 2024. On the whole, it was a year of the haves and the have nots. Digital health startups in the U.S. raised $10.1 billion across 497 deals last year, according to a new report from Rock Health. That total fell from $10.8 billion in 2023, and is about in line with the $8.2 billion raised prior to the pandemic in 2019 when adjusting for inflation. Digital health M&A hit a decade low last year, as the segment notched just 118 deals. An increase in early-stage fundraising activity, along with smaller late-stage deals, account for the lower investment in 2024, Rock Health said. This could spell trouble for later-stage startups that raised money at sky-high valuations during Covid, potentially pushing them toward acquisitions or shuttering operations entirely in 2025. Additionally, large megafunds, health-systems and tech companies held an outsized amount of influence over digital health in 2024, Rock Health said. Venture firms Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst, which secured 20% of all committed LP capital in the U.S. in 2024, were the sector's top investors, for instance. And while artificial intelligence was still a hot investment area within digital health, it's becoming harder for startups to beat out large incumbents. Rock Health said tech companies like Microsoft that can afford to build and maintain expensive foundation models pulled ahead in health-care AI, as did organizations like Epic that can deploy applications of those models on an enterprise-wide scale. There's still room for smaller AI startups to find a niche within health care, but Rock Health said they'll need to "think carefully about their positioning." "These dual trends—early-stage startup activity amidst big moves by large healthcare players—have created a David and Goliath dynamic in the healthcare innovation landscape," Rock Health said. If JPM was any indication, we're in for another interesting year in digital health. We'll see what 2025 has in store. Read the full report here.

Title: JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM): Why This Mega-cap Stock Could Continue Surging Post 52-week Highs

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Mega-Cap Stocks That Could Continue Surging Post 52-Week Highs. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other mega-cap stocks. The US stock markets have gone up leading up to the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration. All the major indices are set to continue their optimism from last week, when the Dow, the S&P, and the Nasdaq all reported gains of over 3.7%. Even though the S&P had hardly moved from its early November levels when the election happened, many mega-cap stocks continue to register 52-week highs. We looked at some of these stocks and why they are expected to continue surging up with the earnings season already underway. To come up with our list of 10 mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs, we only considered stocks that have recently hit their 52-week highs and have a market cap of at least $150 billion. A group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo. JPMorgan Chase and Co. is a global financial services provider. It operates in asset & wealth management, consumer and community banking, and commercial & investment banking segments. The bank has shown a strong upward trend in the previous year with a gain of 55%. The reason for this optimism is the company’s recently announced Q4 performance. It exceeded the expected revenue for Q4 by $1.21 billion. Additionally, GAAP EPS was also higher ($4.81) than expected ($4.10). The Fixed-Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) trading Outperformed this quarter, clocking in at $5.01 billion, surpassing the expected $4.37 billion mark. The bank’s book value per share was up 11% while tangible book value per share was up 13% y/y. The net interest income of the bank was down 3% as compared to the previous year, but it still managed to exceed estimates. The strong performance of the company as well as continuous gain in the stock’s price for the whole year continues to deliver strong results for investors. Overall JPM ranks 1st on our list of the mega-cap stocks that could continue surging post 52-week highs. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as JPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport. I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this). My one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen. To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real-time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer up valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of AI chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on if they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. Seventy-nine percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost 30% decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.
