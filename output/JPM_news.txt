We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year is something I view as a competitive sport. I actually start training for the intense week over the summer, as my few close friends know (and yes, they all make fun of me). The number of workouts every week in the lead-up rises incrementally so I can easily sprint up and down the two-mile promenade with a backpack to stuff in as many meetings as humanly possible (yes, I do this). My one cheat meal a week gets replaced by green drinks and extra doses of vitamins to ensure I don't get sick. I meditate twice a day and carefully pick out clothes I know will help me execute at the highest level. Look good, feel good, good things happen. To me, this one event is the closest I will get to being like Michael Jordan in the playoffs — and I am very lucky to be in attendance. And this year, the gathering of the elites flying in on private jets to wax poetic on the world's biggest problems will be extra nutty. Read more: Here are the biggest global risks for 2025 The conference unofficially kicks off on Trump's Inauguration Day. Some CEOs I know who normally would be at Davos all week are dropping in mid-week after working the inauguration party rounds. By Tuesday, the newly minted president may have uncorked a host of executive orders that could impact the businesses of the top CEOs on the ground. And, of course, impact the global markets. This is why this year's WEF will be more important than the norm for you, the average investor. The headlines will be coming in hot and heavy as CEOs look to challenge Trump or get on his good side. They will also look to talk up their businesses ahead of the start of earnings season, and with markets getting a little rockier of late. Here's what yours truly and our very own Jennifer Schonberger will be watching while bundled up in five layers all week. Be sure to bookmark the "streaming now" section on Yahoo Finance to catch all our market-moving interviews in real time. Or tune in where you normally catch us, whether that's on Samsung TV or our nifty app. Unlike our previous trips to Davos over the past decade, I will be taping several special episodes of the Opening Bid podcast on the ground. I could tell you who those guests will be, but where is the fun in that? Best to be surprised! Now, on to that guide... Big bank CEOs: The biggest names in banking, such as JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon, Citi (C) CEO Jane Fraser, and Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick will be in attendance. While this group will all get asked about Trump policies, it's going to be their outlook on interest rates that will be most key to market sentiment. Most have not spoken publicly since the Fed signaled a likely halt in rate cuts last month, and they will want to be heard ahead of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. The tariff CEOs: Retail will have a nice showing at Davos, with the CEOs of Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Williams Sonoma (WSM), and Gap (GAP) (their CEO's first time at the event) making the rounds. These companies are right in the middle of the tariff debate. I'll be interested in how they are preparing for Trump tariffs from a supply chain perspective. I am also interested in how much they could raise prices post-tariffs — it could offer valuable insight into the 2025 inflation outlook and Fed policy. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? The race to catch Nvidia: It will be another year of artificial intelligence chatter throughout the halls of Davos. This time, I think the discussions will take two forms. First, unlike last year, where the AI discussions were mostly about potential, investors are going to want to see clear lines to revenue and profits. So I encourage AI CEOs to bring it. And two, we will probably hear more about how Big Tech players in Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are aiming to develop their own high-powered AI chips to catch Nvidia (NVDA), or at least make good enough chips to diversify. Leaders from OpenAI and Anthropic will also be in attendance, and their thoughts on chips could be key. I'll be watching Nvidia's stock price like a hawk this week, and you should be as well. Crypto delegation: The crypto industry has had a solid presence at Davos in the past five years. This year, the industry is expected to be out in force, headlined by an appearance from Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong. I'll be quite attuned to what the crypto crowd thinks about the latest volatility in bitcoin, MicroStrategy's (MSTR) bitcoin buying binge, what they are hearing from the pro-crypto Trump administration, and early assessments on Paul Atkins as the likely next SEC chairman. And of course, the new Trump coin that debuted to much fanfare (and market cap) on Friday. The token quickly rose to a market cap of $73 billion in about 48 hours, surpassing DOGE as the largest meme coin so far. The market cap of the crypto has since dropped to $12 billion from its launch, according to CoinMarketCap. Stocks: Stocks are beginning to look top-heavy (especially the Magnificent 7), as I have reported. I'm eager to hear from market pros such as JPMorgan's Mary Erdoes and economic experts like Nouriel Roubini on whether they are seeing red flags on the horizon. Any calls they make at this Davos may hold greater weight given more volatile market conditions and increased Trump policy uncertainty. The political wild cards: As of this writing, contacts have told me President-elect Donald Trump plans to send delegates to Davos. Who precisely gets the nod is the wild card. (I fancy it will be potential Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a Davos party scene regular for many years. Elon has long hated Davos, so hard to see him appearing). Trump himself is slated to give a speech remotely on Thursday, a source told Yahoo Finance. But who ultimately shows up from Trump's orbit — and what they say once touching down — could set the tone on US international relations right out of the gate. If a delegate arrives at Davos days after Trump takes actions that could weigh on the economic growth of foreign countries and then aims to explain the actions, best believe the inevitable headlines may not be so market-friendly. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Stocks Await More Earnings After Strong Start And Better Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/19/stocks-await-more-earnings-after-strong-start-and-better-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-01-19T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
Last week, better bank earnings and friendly details within inflation data, sent stocks and bonds ... [+] higher. This week the focus will be on more fourth-quarter earnings and politics, with the Trump administration taking power and likely to begin making policy changes. Within the S&P 500, 20 companies reported earnings last week, dominated by large bank earnings. 79% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. The pace of the third-quarter earnings season picks up this week, with 40 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. S&P 500 Earnings Season Better bank earnings and friendly inflation readings sent bond yields lower and stocks higher. The S&P 500 rose 2.9% for the week, and the Magnificent 7 gained 2.0%. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). Notably, bank stocks soared 8.2% on the back of better earnings. Market Performance While headline consumer inflation (CPI) rose to 2.9% year-over-year, there was better news beneath the surface. The rate of services inflation continued to decelerate. If this easing in services prices continues, combined with the likely deceleration in housing costs, the headline inflation rate should begin to moderate again. Headline & Services Inflation Until relief came last week, rising bond yields had begun to weigh on stock prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had approached 4.8% on January 14 after being as low as 3.6% in mid-September 2024. Interestingly, the rise in yields has been primarily due to the increase in real (after-inflation expectations) yield rather than increasing inflation expectations. The better details within last week’s inflation reading sent the 10-year Treasury yield down to 4.6%. 10-Year Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition Banks make up a sizable portion of this week's earnings reporters, but other companies reporting are 3M (MMM), Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). The financial sector contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement. According to FactSet data, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings for the financial sector, which rose to 47.5% from 39.3%. Generally speaking, loan growth remained modest for the banks in the fourth quarter, but capital markets activity significantly boosted earnings. Bank Loans: Year-Over-Year Change The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by the powerful technology and communications services duo. Bringing up the rear is the energy sector, with a forecasted almost thirty percent decline in year-over-year earnings. 4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings Growth By Sector Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are again the group to watch this earnings season. According to FactSet, the Magnificent 7’s earnings are expected to grow by 21.7% year-over-year versus 9.7% for the rest of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 earnings aren’t scheduled to begin until the week of January 27. Magnificent 7: Fourth-Quarter Estimated Earnings Growth The significant decline in oil prices year-over-year should result in the expected earnings decline for the energy sector and weigh on materials. Energy Commodities Price Change The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter will likely depress international earnings growth at the margin. U.S. Dollar Strengthens Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.7% has slightly exceeded expectations, with the tailwind from an estimated 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. GDP & S&P 500 Sales Growth Sales growth is expected to be the most robust in the technology sector, with the energy sector predicted to show a decline in year-over-year revenue due to lower oil prices. 4Q 2024 Estimates Sales Growth By Sector Primarily due to the robust earnings growth for the banks, the blended earnings performance has outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +12.5% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Estimate Summary With few meaningful economic releases this week, markets are likely to be dominated by earnings and politics. President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday could unleash a wave of policy announcements, which could lead to some volatility in the impacted sectors. While the banks provided a solid start to the earnings season, this week’s reporters should give a glimpse into additional sectors and a strong dose of additional banks. Forward earnings guidance for 2025 will be watched closely as double-digit profit growth expectations are baked into consensus estimates.

Title: Goldman Sachs boosts David Solomon's pay 25% — and offers a sweet stock deal to remain CEO

Goldman Sachs (GS+2.11%) is locking in CEO David Solomon for at least another five years with a sweet stock deal — along with a big, annual pay increase. The investment bank is offering Solomon 130,508 restricted stock units, valued at $80 million, with a five-year vesting period, Goldman disclosed in a regulatory filing dated Thursday. President and chief operating officer John Waldron — considered Solomon’s leading successor — received the same retention package. These so-called retention grants or RSUs are a sign that the firm plans to hold onto their executives, at least for the duration of the vesting period. That’s on top of the $39 million total compensation package given to Solomon for 2024, up a hefty 25.8% from $31 million in 2023. That puts Solomon’s pay up there with leaders at other top banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM+1.92%) CEO Jamie Dimon, who received a $36 million compensation package in 2023, and former Morgan Stanley (MS+1.52%) CEO James Gorman, who made $37 million in his last year with the firm. Other Wall Street banks have not yet disclosed their CEO compensation for the 2024 fiscal year. Goldman attributed the pay bump to the firm’s strong performance last year, including a “significant year-over-year improvement as a result of strategic execution.” The firm also pointed to a “48% increase in stock price, a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend and 7% book value per share growth, resulting in record amount of capital returned to common shareholders in 2024.” Goldman reported Wednesday that it saw $13.87 billion in net revenues for the three months ended Dec. 31, a 23% year-over-year jump. Profit more than doubled to $4.11 billion, for the fourth quarter, from $2.01 billion a year ago. For the full year, Goldman brought in net revenues of $53.51 billion and net earnings of $14.28 billion. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert.

US stock futures popped on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off, as investors waited for crucial consumer inflation data that could reset interest-rate bets. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) climbed roughly 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) pushed 0.4% higher. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) also added 0.2%, on the heels of a mixed day on Wall Street. Stocks took a leg higher in pre-market as Wall Street banks posted surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record annual profit and a 50% jump in fourth quarter net income. Its full-year profit of $58 billion was the highest ever in American banking. Its stock rose 1% before the bell. BlackRock (BLK) stock popped after quarterly profit jumped over 20% as assets hit a record $11.6 trillion. Goldman Sachs (GS), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) shares also gained after the banks booked bumper quarters. Markets are now bracing for Wednesday's report on the consumer price index for December, seen as potential pivot point for stocks after wholesale inflation for the month came in cool.
