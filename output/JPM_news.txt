ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Markets surged to fresh record highs recently on the back of July’s consumer inflation reading. The data increased expectations for a rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s September meeting. Trade sentiment also improved after President Trump extended the U.S.–China tariff truce for an additional 90 days. While the tone in markets this week has been broadly optimistic, valuations remain elevated. The S&P 500 trades at valuation levels not seen since the dot-com crash. Identifying stocks that combine strong fundamentals with cheap valuations should remain a priority for diligent investors. My firm’s AI Agent is designed to screen for such opportunities by leveraging proven-superior data to produce more precise, transparent, and reliable signals. The outperformance of the “Very Attractive Stocks Index”, which holds the stocks in the Bloomberg 1000 Index that get a Very Attractive Rating, is proof of the alpha the AI Agent produces in the market. My Long Idea this week highlights a company with industry leading-profitability, revenue growth across all business segments, record profits, and a cheap stock price. I originally made JPMorgan Chase (JPM: $293/share) a Long Idea in May 2020 and most recently reiterated my position on the stock in November 2024. JPMorgan Chase recently beat both top- and bottom-line estimates in 2Q25, and now that the company has filed its latest 10-Q, I find that the stock still presents Very Attractive risk/reward. JPMorgan Chase reported strong results across its business in 2Q25. The company’s firmwide average loans and deposits were up 5% and 6% year-over-year (YoY), respectively. More specifically, JPMorgan Chase reported quality growth across all three business segments, including: These results continue a trend of long-term fundamental strength for the largest bank in the United States. JPMorgan Chase’s revenue composition reflects a strategically balanced model, with total net revenue split nearly evenly between net interest income (NII) and noninterest revenue (NIR). This diversification mitigates earnings volatility tied to interest rate fluctuations and reinforces the firm’s resilience across market cycles. Notably, JPMorgan Chase has demonstrated consistent growth in both revenue streams over the past decade. The company grew NII from $43.6 billion in 2014 to $93.2 billion in the TTM ended 2Q25, which represents compound annual growth of 7%. JPMorgan Chase grew its NIR from $50.6 billion to $82.4 billion over the same time, or 5% compounded annually. See Figure 1. Figure 1: JPMorgan Chase’s NII and NIR: 2014 – TTM JPMorgan Chase leverages its diversified business model to continually grow its top- and bottom-line. JPMorgan Chase has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 10% and 11% compounded annually since 2014. See Figure 2. In each of the past three fiscal years, and the TTM ended 2Q25, the company’s NOPAT reached record highs. The company improved its NOPAT margin from 21% in 2014 to 23% in the TTM while invested capital turns rose from 0.4 to 0.7 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 8% in 2014 to 16% in the TTM ended 2Q25. Additionally, the company’s Core Earnings, a superior and cleaner earnings measure, grew 10% compounded annually from $22.2 billion in 2014 to $60.6 billion in the TTM. Figure 2: JPMorgan Chase’s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014 JPMorgan Chase has not only grown revenue and profits to record levels, but it has done so while maintaining industry leading margins and ROIC. As I mentioned earlier in the report, the company has improved both its operational efficiency (NOPAT margin) and its balance sheet efficiency (invested capital turns) over the last decade. Per Figure 3, JPMorgan Chase has the highest NOPAT margin and ROIC among peers which include, Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Figure 3: JPMorgan Chase’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM Due to its superior capitalization, JPMorgan Chase maintains a stronger financial position than its peers, too. At the end of 2Q25, JPMorgan Chase’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1), the equity portion of its Tier 1 Capital, was 15.1%, which is up from 12.4% at the of 2019 and 10.2% in 2014. Importantly, JPMorgan Chase’s CET1 ratio is well above the 4.5% minimum required by the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the company’s Tier 1 Capital ratio, which measures a bank’s core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets is 16.1% through the 2Q25, which is up from 14.1% in 2019 and 11.6% in 2014. Once again, JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 1 Capital ratio is well above the 6.0% minimum required by the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase’s Tier 1 Capital and CET 1 ratios have been trending higher for over a decade. See Figure 4. Figure 4: Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratios: 2010 – 2Q25 Per Figure 5, JPMorgan Chase’s CET1 ratio ranks above big bank peers mentioned earlier in the report. The company’s Tier 1 Capital ratio is higher than all listed peers except Morgan Stanley (MS). Figure 5: JPMorgan Chase’s Capital Ratios Vs. Peers – 2Q25 JPMorgan Chase has paid $87.7 billion (11% of market cap) in dividends since 2019 and increased its quarterly dividend from $0.80/share in 2Q19 to $1.40/share in 2Q25. The company’s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 1.9% yield. JPMorgan Chase also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Since 2019, JPMorgan Chase repurchased $95.9 billion (12% of market cap) shares. During the first six months of 2025, the company repurchased $15.1 billion shares. In July 2025, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program of $50 billion. Should the company repurchase shares at the TTM pace, it would repurchase $25.7 billion of shares over the next 12 months, which is 3.2% of the company’s current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 5.1%. Investors should take comfort in knowing JPMorgan Chase will be able to afford to pay its dividends and repurchase shares due to its large free cash flow (FCF) generation. From 2019 through 1H25, JPMorgan Chase generated $201.2 billion in FCF, which equals 25% of the company’s enterprise value. Figure 6: JPMorgan Chase’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow: 2019 – 1H25 JPMorgan Chase’s $201.2 billion in FCF since 2019 is more than enough to cover its $183.6 billion in combined dividend payments ($87.7 billion) and share repurchases ($95.9 billion). JPMorgan Chase’s repurchases have also meaningfully reduced its shares outstanding from 3.1 billion in 2019 to 2.7 billion in 2Q25. See Figure 7. I like companies that choose to return capital to shareholders instead of spending it on costly acquisitions or executive bonuses that rarely drive shareholder value creation. Companies that sport strong enough cash flows to consistently lower their shares outstanding offer excellent value. Figure 7: JPMorgan Chase’s Shares Outstanding: 2019 – 2Q25 Expectations for a rate cut in September are on the rise, in part due to the latest CPI data and comments from Fed officials. Fed governor Bowman aims for three interest rate cuts in the remainder of 2025. An interest rate cut would put pressure on all banks’, JPMorgan Chase included, net interest margin (NIM) and in turn their NII. In its 2Q25 10-Q, JPMorgan Chase disclosed its earnings-at-risk sensitivity depending on different movement in rates. In this analysis, JPMorgan Chase determined that a 100-basis point interest rate decline results in a $2 billion decrease in earnings. Similarly, a 200-basis point interest rate decline results in a nearly $5 billion decrease in earnings. The good news? This exposure to lower rates is down from the company’s sensitivity in December 2024, which coincides with rising expectations for a rate cut. JPMorgan Chase maintains the best capital ratios in the industry and is best positioned to grow noninterest revenue throughout all cycles. Additionally, any pressure on profits is already more than priced into JPMorgan Chase’s current stock price, as I’ll show below. At its current price of $293/share, JPMorgan Chase has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.0. This ratio means the market expects the company’s profits to never grow from TTM ended 2Q25 levels. For reference, JPMorgan Chase has grown NOPAT 11% compounded annually over the last five, ten, and 26 (longest period in my model) years. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to quantify the cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for JPM. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock would be worth $293/share today – equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow just 2% compounded annually from 2025 – 2034, which is well below the company’s historical NOPAT growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth $377/share today – a 29% upside to the current price. In this scenario, JPMorgan Chase’s NOPAT would grow 5% compounded annually through fiscal 2034, which would still be below the company’s NOPAT compound annual growth rates over the past 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year periods. Should NOPAT grow closer to historical rates, the upside would be even larger. Figure 8 compares JPMorgan Chase’s historical NOPAT to the NOPAT implied in each of the above scenarios.

Title: Wall Street Sees U.S. Entry as Catalyst for Bullish’s Next Leg Up

Crypto platform Bullish (BLSH), the parent company of CoinDesk, received a number of stock ratings from Wall Street analysts on Monday, as brokerage firms initiated coverage of the stock after its recent IPO. Rosenblatt Securities started coverage with a buy rating and a $60 price target, citing shifting U.S. political winds and rising institutional adoption as key catalysts for growth, the broker said in a research report Monday. The firm argues that Bullish, one of the largest regulated institutional exchanges, is well positioned to capitalize on what it calls a “dramatic improvement” in the U.S. political environment for digital assets. Despite not yet serving U.S. clients, Bullish has already handled more than $500 billion in annual trading volume, a scale Rosenblatt views as evidence of demand. The upcoming U.S. launch is expected to be a major catalyst, the broker noted, while the passage of the GENIUS Act has opened a new opportunity in stablecoins. Rosenblatt believes stablecoin-related revenue could provide recurring income less exposed to trading volatility. Stablecoin values are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets providing, among other things, a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. The sector has a market cap of about $280 billion, CoinGecko data show, and is dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle Internet's USDC. Bullish’s ownership of media properties and potential expansion into retail trading add further upside, according to the note. On that basis, Rosenblatt values the stock at 31x projected 2027 adjusted EBITDA, underpinning its $60 target. Rival broker Canaccord Genuity has also initiated coverage of Bullish with a buy rating and a $68 price target, highlighting the exchange’s growing institutional traction and potential boost from a pending New York BitLicense. Founded in 2020, Bullish has quickly become a major player in crypto trading, recently leading global regulated exchanges in spot trading volumes for bitcoin BTC$114,935.41, ether (ETH), and stablecoins, the report said. The company has expanded beyond trading with the acquisitions of CoinDesk in 2023 and CCData in 2024, adding media, data, and information services to its business lines. Canaccord analysts also note Bullish’s role in the emerging “stablecoin wars,” supporting issuers like PayPal (PYPL) and Société Générale (GLE) with listings, liquidity, and promotion. Already licensed in Europe and Asia, Bullish is expected to secure a BitLicense soon, opening access to U.S. institutional clients, the analysts wrote. Despite conservative assumptions in its forecasts, including flat bitcoin prices through 2027, Canaccord points to Bullish’s early profitability, balance sheet bolstered by $2.4 billion in bitcoin, and long-term growth prospects as reasons for optimism. Meanwhile, broker Bernstein has initiated coverage of Bullish with a market-perform rating and a $60 price target, highlighting the exchange’s experienced management team and its ambition to become the second-largest institutional platform after Coinbase. That outcome, the firm says, hinges on a successful U.S. launch in 2026, where Coinbase currently dominates but opportunities are emerging around stablecoins, market data and indices. Bullish’s ownership of CoinDesk also offers potential optionality if it moves into retail exchange services. "We expect Bullish to capture ~8% market share in U.S spot institutional crypto volumes by 2027E, while global spot market share remains at ~7%," analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) has also initiated coverage of Bullish, assigning the crypto exchange operator a neutral rating and a price target of $50. Like Bernstein, the JPMorgan analyst also pointed to Bullish’s experienced management team and its ability to navigate the fast-evolving digital asset landscape. The bank's analyst said growth will likely be fueled by rising institutional demand for crypto exposure and the increasing role of tokens and stablecoins in trading activity. Bullish is also well-positioned to expand into the U.S. market, building on its existing foothold in Europe and Asia. According to the bank, another growth driver will be its Liquidity Services business, where clearer regulation could broaden the range of supported blockchains and tokens, creating a stronger environment for exchanges like Bullish. Still, JPMorgan noted that the firm’s current scale remains limited relative to its market opportunity. With the company at what the bank called a “critical point of maturity,” analysts said valuation concerns justify staying on the sidelines for now. The shares were trading 3.6% lower, around $50.53, at publication time.
