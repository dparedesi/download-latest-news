US stock market futures today struggled to gain momentum as Dow Jones and S&P 500 stalled, while Nasdaq futures dipped after June’s CPI report showed inflation rising faster than expected. With Federal Reserve rate cut hopes fading, Wall Street is now looking to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for more clues. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs are also adding pressure on markets, as traders reassess inflation risks and policy direction. Meanwhile, rising Treasury yields and mixed corporate earnings from firms like Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson have added uncertainty. Get the full picture on where markets might head next.
