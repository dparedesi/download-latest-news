Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are rising as investors monitor developments on U.S.-China trade tensions and digest strong earnings reports from major financial institutions; the Fed’s Beige Book will offer some economic insights amid a data blackout due to the federal government shutdown; ASML Holding shares are rising after the semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected quarterly income; and Jeep-maker Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. production. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher after major indexes turned in a mixed performance yesterday amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.8% and Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures added 0.5%. Gold futures were up more than 1% at $4,215 an ounce, as the precious metal continues hitting record highs amid economic uncertainty and stock market volatility. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $112,000, down from from an overnight high of $113,600 and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a variety of consumer loans, was holding steady at 4.02%, near a five-week low. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) this morning released quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations, joining several other major institutions that released strong earnings reports yesterday. Bank of America reported third-quarter revenue of $28.24 billion, better than the $27.5 billion expected from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $1.06 topped the consensus view of 95 cents. Morgan Stanley reported revenue of $18.2 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $16.69 billion, while EPS of $2.80 came in above estimates of $2.11. Investors will be keeping tabs on what bank executives are saying about the outlook for their businesses after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Tuesday "of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation." Shares of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were up more than 4% in recent premarket trading. With data releases delayed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week, investors will be closely watching today’s 2 p.m. ET release of the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book.” The Beige Book provides a summary of economic conditions in each of the 12 regions of the Federal Reserve and is published two weeks before each Fed meeting, with the next scheduled for Oct. 28-29. While investors won’t get the Consumer Price Index report for September that was originally scheduled for release today, that report will be published on Oct. 24, as officials said that the data was needed to determine Social Security payment levels. ASML Holding (ASML) shares are rising in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected income and sought to reassure investors on 2026 sales, even as its third quarter sales came in below analysts' estimates. ASML reported quarterly revenue of 7.516 billion euros ($8.74 billion), compared with expectations of 7.67 billion euros ($8.92 billion) from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Net income of 2.125 billion euros ($2.47 billion) was above the analyst consensus of 2.083 billion ($2.42 billion). The company said it expected 2026 sales to exceed 2025 levels, but would provide more information in January. ASML warned in July that it couldn’t guarantee growth in 2026 due to ongoing trade tensions with China. ASML shares, which have gained more than 40% since the start of the year, rose more than 4% ahead of the bell. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) said it would invest $13 billion into U.S. auto manufacturing over the next four years, the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year U.S. history. The investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the company’s brands, which includes Jeep and Chrysler, and the addition of 5,000 new jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The automaker recently reported a rise in third-quarter U.S. sales, which snapped a two-year streak of year-over-year sales declines. Shares of Stellantis were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading.

Title: Are Leveraged ETFs to Blame for Selloffs? JPM Says Yes

Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com When markets tumble, everyone starts looking for a suspect, and leveraged ETFs could be next in the police lineup. JPMorgan analysts blamed levered ETFs for Friday’s stock selloff, which resulted in the S&P 500’s biggest one-day loss since April, in a research note published Monday. JPMorgan Managing Director Bram Kaplan said leveraged products will “likely trigger further systematic selling flows this week, leaving markets fragile.” Although the drop was triggered initially by President Donald Trump’s threat of new tariffs against China, the note estimated that roughly $26 billion of selloffs from leveraged ETFs worsened the decline. While experts agreed on the dangers posed to individual investors by leveraged funds, not everyone was convinced of their widespread risks. “I wouldn’t say that leveraged ETFs wholesale create systemic issues,” said Bryan Armour, Morningstar’s director of ETF and passive strategies. “But there definitely have been instances where they make things worse.” Leveraged ETFs are still relatively new to the scene, but the role they play in shaping macroeconomic trends might be outsized. Leveraged ETFs typically hold swaps instead of options. Because of the structure and high liquidity of swaps, their price can swing wildly, particularly in leveraged products, which promise 2x or 3x returns on underlying holdings. “Forced buying and selling when everyone knows roughly what they’re going to have to do can be very problematic,” Armour said. “It can increase volatility [and] hurt investors in the leveraged ETF, because then they have to sell lower and buy higher each day.” Still, there is reason to believe levered products aren’t all to blame: Ultimately, Armour doesn’t think the amount of assets these ETFs currently hold is significant enough to have much of an impact. The largest 3x leveraged product is the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), which only has around $29 billion in AUM, according to VettaFi data. Doesn’t Ring a Bell. The hope is that individuals will recognize the risks of these funds before buying into them, said Morningstar research analyst Lan Anh Tran. “It’s hard to tell where investors are interested in putting their money next,” she said. “With these leveraged or inverse leveraged ETFs, they blow up every once in a while, and then the next year, it seems people are going through a collective amnesia. They forget that that ever happened.” No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Stock futures and bitcoin are sliding this morning, while gold continues hitting new highs, as investors keep an eye on developments related to trade tensions with China and await a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; quarterly results from major U.S. banks are coming in better than analysts had anticipated; GM shares are down after the automaker revealed a $1.6 billion charge over weakness in its EV business; and shares of rare earth miners continue surging following China’s announcement of trade restrictions on the high-tech materials. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open after major indexes rebounded Monday from a steep downturn to close out last week, as concerns linger about trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies. Investors this morning are digesting earnings reports from major banks and are awaiting remarks from Fed Chair Powell, who is due to speak this afternoon on the outlook for the economy and interest rates. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.7% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq dropped 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. Bitcoin was also down sharply after yesterday's rally, sliding to $111,300 in recent trading from an overnight high of around $116,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which affects borrowing costs on an array of consumer loans, fell to 4.02%, its lowest level in a month. Precious metals continue rising as many investors turn to safe-haven assets amid increasing stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. Gold futures were up 0.4% at $4,150 an ounce in recent trading, after hitting a record high of just under $4,200 earlier in the session. (Read here about how the surge in gold prices—the price of the precious metal is up nearly 60% since the start of the year—is leading a growing number consumers to sell gold jewelry, coins and other items.) Silver futures were also trading at an all-time high this morning, rising slightly to around $50.50 an ounce. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported better-than-expected earnings as the banking giant led a string of reports from major financial institutions. JPMorgan shares were up slightly in premarket trading after the bank reported a 9% rise in revenue and a 12% jump in profits as increased stock trading helped boost the results. Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose 3% ahead of the bell after the bank reported strong net interest income and raised its profitability target. Goldman Sachs (GS) also reported revenue and earnings that came in ahead of expectations, though its shares dropped about 2.5%. Citigroup (C) shares were up 1% after its results beat estimates. General Motors (GM) said that its quarterly earnings next week will include a $1.6 billion charge associated with its electric vehicle business. The move comes after the U.S. ended its $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. “Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” the automaker said in a filing. GM shares were down about 2% in premarket trading. Shares of U.S. rare earth mineral mining firms continued to gain in premarket trading after China threatened to restrict exports of the materials that are critical for high tech products. Shares of USA Rare Earth (USAR) were up 12% after gaining 19% yesterday. MP Materials (MP) shares were up 7% ahead of the bell, after soaring 21% in the prior session.

After Friday’s big selloff as President Trump fired back at China’s tightening of rare earths export curbs with higher tariffs, investors will be watching closely for the latest trade policy developments. An ongoing federal government shutdown may delay the release of several economic reports, but investors can look forward to a full slate of corporate earnings from big banks and mainstays in the semiconductor industry. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and American Express are on the list of major financial firms set to report this week, while reports from TSMC, Johnson & Johnson, and United Airlines will also be in focus. Without a resolution to the budget dispute, the government shutdown will enter its third week, likely delaying the release of data on wholesale inflation, retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims. Homebuilder confidence and small business optimism surveys are still scheduled, and several Federal Reserve speakers are expected to deliver remarks, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The bond market is closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday (observed in some places as Indigenous Peoples Day), while major stock exchanges are open. The Federal Reserve system, major financial institutions, and many federal, state, and local government offices will be closed on Monday. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. This week is set to bring third-quarter updates from some of the world's biggest banks and top financial institutions, starting with Tuesday's release from JPMorgan Chase. The world’s largest bank by market capitalization has reported better-than-expected revenue in the year’s first two quarters, even as sales declined and net interest income came up short in its most recent report amid CEO Jamie Dimon’s warnings about "turbulence" in the economy. Others expected to release quarterly financials Tuesday include Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and CitiGroup. Reports from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to follow Wednesday, while Charles Schwab, Bank of New York Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp are scheduled for Thursday. Earnings from American Express, Truist Financial, and State Street are slated for Friday. The world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC, is set to report its results Thursday, after growing its revenue by 40% in the first half of 2025 on strong sales of AI chips. Chipmaking equipment maker ASML looks to report Wednesday after the Dutch firm raised worries about future growth amid tariff pressures. Also this week, cloud computing giant Oracle will host a three-day AI World conference beginning on Monday, and customer relationship management software firm Salesforce's Dreamforce event starts Tuesday. With the federal government shutdown heading into its third week, the blackout on economic data releases is likely to continue. The Thursday reports on U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims and Friday’s update on housing starts could be delayed by the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it plans to release on Oct. 24 the Consumer Price Index inflation report for September that was originally scheduled for release on Wednesday. Several Federal Reserve officials are also scheduled to speak, coming as the central bank is set to release its Beige Book economic update on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell is due to give an economic update on Tuesday, with remarks also expected this week from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Some data releases are still expected, including a survey of small business optimism on Tuesday and report on homebuilder confidence on Thursday.
