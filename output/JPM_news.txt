HSBC is detailing its major downgrade of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. On Tuesday, HSBC dropped its recommendation on JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) from hold to reduce. The firm also downgraded the recommendation on Bank of America from buy to hold. In an interview, HSBC’s head of US financials research, Saul Martinez, says the banks have solid fundamentals, but their valuations raise concerns. “We were not adopting a more negative view of operating fundamentals. We still think that net interest income is on the right track. You know, you are seeing some growth there. Obviously, there are some nuances to each of the downgrades, JPMorgan, Goldman to reduce and Bank of America to hold, but at a high level, it’s valuation. Pricing is not factoring in downside risk and the dilutive impact of buybacks at much higher multiples.” Martinez says he was not convinced that JPMorgan deserves its price. “In JPMorgan’s case, I think the math just doesn’t work at these valuations. The stock, so with banks, you look at price to tangible book value multiples and return on tangible common equity. Higher ROTC (return on tangible common equity), higher price to tangible. JPMorgan is trading close to three times tangible. That is a very elevated multiple.” He says it’s a similar case for Goldman Sachs. “We feel like we’re swimming against the tide with Goldman a little bit because the investment banking landscape is good. The risk-reward is very skewed here. We think good news is priced in, but again, if the market cools off and IB (investment banking) activity doesn’t really move forward, we don’t get a super cycle in IB activity, I think there’s more room for disappointment here than for upside.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Shares of MP Materials (MP) surged 50% in Thursday morning after the rare earths miner announced a multibillion-dollar agreement with the Department of Defense. The DoD is set to become MP Materials' largest shareholder at 15% following an initial $400 million purchase of a new class of "preferred stock convertible into shares of the Company's common stock, and a warrant permitting DoD to purchase additional shares of the Company's common stock." MP Materials will use the government investment, along with a $1 billion funding line from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to fund the construction of its second domestic magnet manufacturing facility at a yet-to-be-decided location. The company also agreed to a 10-year deal with the DoD establishing the government as a long-term customer of MP's rare earths with a price floor of $110 per kilogram. The Trump administration has stated that becoming less dependent on other nations like China for rare earths—metals used in production of a variety of commercial and military products—is a top priority and national security concern. Shares of MP and USA Rare Earth (USAR) have been boosted this year by that commitment. MP Materials hit their highest price since April 2022 on Thursday morning, while USA Rare Earth shares were up nearly 14% shortly after markets opened. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

U.S. equities were slightly lower at midday as the market weighed the potential impact of the latest Trump administration tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrials Average slipped 0.2%, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down marginally. Shares of alternative energy firms, including Enphase Energy (ENPH), First Solar (FSLR), NextEra Energy (NEE), dipped after President Donald Trump signed an executive order designed to slash most government support for the industry. Shares of Newmont (NEM) and rival gold miners declined along with the price of the precious metal as higher bond yields made gold a less attractive investment. Shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Goldman Sachs (GS) slipped on downgrades from HSBC, which warned it had become more cautious about bank stocks following their recent runup. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) shares gained on an upgrade from Wolfe Research, which brushed off previous concerns about the toolmaker's earnings revisions, and saw improvement in its end markets. U.S.-listed shares of Sequans Communications (SQNS) soared when the Paris-based manufacturer of semiconductors for the Internet of Things said it had raised $384 million to begin buying bitcoin. GlobalFoundries (GFS) shares jumped after the chipmaker bought artificial intelligence and processor IP supplier MIPS. The price was not given. Oil futures advanced. The U.S. dollar was up on the pound and yen, and was little changed against the euro. Major cryptocurrencies mostly rose. TradingView
