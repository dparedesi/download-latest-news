Whether you're building a new&nbsp;ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds ... [+] are worth a look. Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). You get these same top stocks in an S&P 500 fund but with less concentration. Head-to-head, the mega-cap index outperforms the S&P 500 slightly, albeit with more volatility. The Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF replicates the CRSP US Mega Cap Value Index. The index includes the largest value stocks, covering about 70% of U.S. market capitalization. There are 136 index constituents. The value focus of MGV should appeal to bargain-hunting, risk-averse equity investors. You won’t find too many fast-moving tech stocks in this portfolio. The fund favors financials, health care and industrials. The technology sector is represented but by less prominent stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Relative to VOO, MGV has produced slightly lower returns. The fund does deliver a reasonable yield of 2.06%, so it might be a candidate for those who favor dividend ETFs. Vanguard's VONG fund invests in Russell 1000 Growth stocks. This index currently includes 395 Russell 1000 stocks with higher price-to-book ratios, higher two-year earnings forecasts and higher five-year sales-per-share growth. VONG provides nice return potential by focusing on stocks with growth characteristics. The earnings growth rate for this portfolio is 24.9%. The same metric for VOO is 18.9%. This fund has outperformed the others on this list, with a five-year average annual return of 18.82%. High concentrations of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) have driven much of that growth. One trade-off for the appreciation potential is lower cash returns. VONG's 30-day SEC yield is 0.48%. Vanguard's health care fund invests in about 400 large, mid and small cap companies that provide medical products, services or technology. The benchmark index is the MSCI US IMI Health Care 25/50. According to a Deloitte survey in December 2024, health care industry leaders are mostly optimistic about the year ahead. Nearly 70% of survey respondents expect a 2025 revenue increase and 71% expect a boost in profits. VHT is a good position for capitalizing on higher health care profits. Like all funds on this list, VHT has performed well against peers. It also has a low expense ratio of 0.09% and pays a moderate SEC 30-day yield of 1.38%. The portfolio includes Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly (LLY), diversified health care company UnitedHealth (UNH) and biopharma Abbvie (ABBV). Vanguard's technology ETF holds large, mid and small tech stocks, including hardware and software providers and semiconductor companies. The benchmark index is MSCI US IMI Info Technology 25/50. AI has fueled a surge in tech stocks over the last two years. Many experts believe the trend will continue. According to The Wall Street Journal, AI spending is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% between 2024 and 2028. VGT provides broad exposure to the technology sector, from Nvidia and other big names to exciting mid-caps like Astera Labs (ALAB). Note that the fund is market-cap-weighted, so the mega caps will drive the overall performance. That could be good or bad, depending on your outlook and risk tolerance. Bottom Line Whether you're building a new ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds are worth a look. They have low fees and cover popular market segments, broad to niche. You can double-down on growth, find value bargains or tweak your sector exposure. It’s no wonder Vanguard is the most popular fund family in the U.S.

This is the second-best February performance in a decade. While overall growth is moderate, the market remains stable. February being a shorter month also impacted the sales data. Mumbai’s property market is well positioned for long-term stability and growth. Large-scale infrastructure projects and a redevelopment boom, coupled with a strong economic outlook, are boosting the market. The broader outlook for the real estate sector remains resilient. The full impact of the RBI rate cut, tax cuts in the budget, and liquidity measures announced by the RBI is expected to provide much-needed support by increasing affordability for buyers, ensuring market stability is maintained. We continue to believe that the demand for homes developed by reputed developers in township and gated communities will command a premium and renewed demand.” Post Covid Nifty has seen 14-15% PE or Price compression.

Traditional 2W players are better off in EV Neutral on Pharma sector Not expecting a rate cut soon. 50:50 chances in Feb. The latest government data reveals that over 11,300 homes were sold in Mumbai in February 2025. This translates to over 400 units sold per day, a phenomenal achievement. This is positive news for the real estate sector, indicating a growing interest in homes in the city. We expect the positive trend to continue and witness an upward trajectory. Firstly, the full impact of RBI’s rate cut and measures announced in the Union Budget will be seen in the months to come. Developers offering various lucrative schemes and incentives to attract buyers will boost sales. Additionally, there is a demand for both premium and mid-end categories, particularly in emerging micro-markets. The heightened traction in the redevelopment will increase inventory and a wider choice for homebuyers. We expect the broader economic recovery to benefit the housing industry Asit C. Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd. (ACMIIL) presents the latest January 2025 Credit Card Market Report, offering a deep dive into spending trends, card issuance patterns, and competitive market dynamics. Key Market Insights: 1. Credit Card Spending Shows Seasonal Decline but Strong YoY Growth Total credit card spending stood at ₹1.8 trillion, reflecting a 2% month-on-month (MoM) decline but a robust 14% year-on-year (YoY) growth. The MoM decline is attributed to a high base effect from December 2024, when festive and holiday-related spending boosted transaction volumes. The average spend per card dipped 1% MoM to ₹16,911, while the average spend per transaction declined 1% MoM and 15% YoY to ₹4,282, indicating evolving consumer behaviour and macroeconomic adjustments. 2. Credit Card Transactions & Issuance Witness a Slowdown Total transaction volume reached 430 million, a 1% MoM decline but still 31% higher YoY. However, this marks the slowest YoY growth since March 2024, reflecting cautious consumer spending. The number of outstanding credit cards declined to 109 million, down from 110 million in December 2024. 1.2 million cards were withdrawn in January, possibly due to tightening credit norms and increased delinquencies. 3. Market Leaders Continue to Strengthen Their Positions HDFC Bank, SBI, and ICICI Bank remain dominant players, collectively maintaining a significant share of the credit card market. HDFC Bank’s market share increased from 20.2% to 21.5% YoY, reflecting strong customer acquisition efforts. SBI recovered from a temporary dip, increasing its share to 18.8%, with 2.4 lakh new cards issued in January. ICICI Bank also regained ground, rising from 16.3% to 16.6% YoY. 4. Midcap and Small-Cap Banks Show Mixed Performance Yes Bank’s market share has remained stagnant at 2.2% since September 2024, signaling a slowdown in its previous aggressive expansion strategy. IDFC First Bank emerged as an outperformer, increasing its market share from 2.4% to 3.1% YoY through an aggressive push in credit card issuance. 5. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Credit Card Embargo Lifted A significant regulatory development in February 2025: The RBI lifted Kotak Mahindra Bank’s 10-month embargo on credit card issuance. This move is expected to help Kotak regain lost market share, which had slipped to 4.6% YoY. The bank’s re-entry is poised to impact competitive market dynamics in the coming months. 6. Disbursement Growth Hits a 4-Year Low The slowdown in credit card disbursement is at a 4-year low, signaling cautious lending practices by banks amid concerns over rising delinquencies and economic uncertainty. The total market share of the top 10 banks remains strong at 92%, showing continued consolidation in the industry. Conclusion & Market Outlook The credit card industry continues to experience strong annual growth, but short-term headwinds remain due to seasonal fluctuations, tightened credit policies, and evolving consumer behavior. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s re-entry and shifts in market share among key players are expected to be key themes in the months ahead.

The top ten States with the highest number of projects registered with their respective RERAs are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan.

Tamil Nadu with 19987 projects accounts for 17% share while Gujarat with 16,265 projects accounts for 14% share. Samir Jasuja, Founder and CEO, PropEquity said: “Due to RERA, there has been a vast improvement in compliance by real estate developers as a result of which the sector has seen huge transparency. This has led to a rise in investment by individual investors, and both domestic and foreign institutional investors thereby further espousing not just India’s but also real estate sector’s growth story.” “The real estate market across 9 top Tier 1 cities are today valued at over Rs 5.5 lakh crore. Unlike the pre-RERA years, absorption every year, post RERA implementation, has been more than launches (except covid year CY 2020), which shows the maturity that this regulation has ushered amongst developers thereby laying a strong foundation for a $1 trillion real estate economy.” “The government must look to align strong regulations and compliance with favourable tax policies for both developers and homebuyers in order to achieve this vision.” The PropEquity report further stated that at 184 units, the average number of units per project is the highest in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Rajasthan at 156 units and Gujarat at 116 units.

Support is now seen at 22,400, while resistance is at 22,625, indicating that the overall trend remains bearish. Early indications from GIFT Nifty suggest a weak start for Indian equities.

The Outlook is Stable. The rating affirmation reflects our view that the strong balance sheet buffers built by TCL in recent years will support its financial profile through the ongoing period of oversupply in the global soda ash industry, despite weakening EBITDA margins. The rating is also supported by TCL’s strong business profile as one of the world’s largest soda ash producers, its cost competitive and geographically diversified operations, and the industry’s end-market diversification.
