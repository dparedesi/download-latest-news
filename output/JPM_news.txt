ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2025/05/15: Sign at the entrance to the JP Morgan Wealth ... More Management building in Midtown Manhattan. (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has seen an increase of approximately 11% year-to-date, in comparison to the 1% rise in the S&P 500 index during the same timeframe. In contrast, JPMorgan's competitor Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) has risen by 6% over the same duration. So, what has contributed to the strong performance of JPMorgan stock? The banking giant exceeded Wall Street expectations in the first quarter of FY 2025. Revenue for the quarter climbed 8% to $46.01 billion, driven by stronger asset management and investment banking fees, along with solid trading outcomes. Trading revenue was especially remarkable, increasing 48% to $3.8 billion. Net income rose by 9% to $14.6 billion, or $5.07 a share. The bank's asset management division has also performed well because of heightened asset prices. Assets under management jumped 15% year-over-year to $4.1 trillion. Furthermore, if you're looking for upside with a steadier experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved >91% returns since its inception. That being said, the bank has adopted a cautious stance regarding its outlook due to geopolitical factors, the U.S. imposition of tariffs on trading partners, and worries about inflation. These inflation concerns have led to an increase in treasury yields, with the 10-year yield standing at over 4.40%, up from 4.01% in early April, while the yield on the 30-year bond is just beneath 5%. This situation could have a mixed impact on JPMorgan. Increased rates and market volatility might negatively affect the investment banking sector, as they typically cause delays in IPO listings, mergers, and acquisition activities. However, from a lending perspective, higher yields expand the margin between what banks earn on loans and what they pay on deposits, which generally enhances net interest income and profitability, although there could be some effect on credit quality. Additionally, market volatility could partially be mitigated by the company’s strength in its trading operations. Currently, JPM stock is trading at approximately $265 per share, or about 2.6 times its tangible book value. Although this makes the bank appear expensive relative to its peers, this could be partially justified by its strong capital position, superior credit quality, and proactive risk management strategies, which may enable it to perform better in the current environment. JPM has also been intensifying its capital returns program. Over the last quarter, the bank repurchased $7 billion in common stock and announced a 12% increase in the common dividend. We estimate the value of JPM stock at around $240 per share, slightly beneath the current market price.

Major U.S. equities indexes finished higher after data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed an unexpected uptick in job openings in April, although several economists cautioned that tariffs could weigh on jobs growth as the year advances. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session 0.6% higher. The Dow added 0.5%. Strength among semiconductor firms and the rest of the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq 0.8%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets roundup here. Dollar General (DG) shares surged 16%, chalking up the S&P 500's top daily performance after the discount retailer topped quarterly sales and profit estimates and boosted its full-year outlook. The company anticipated that it should be able to mitigate most tariff-related cost pressure but expressed uncertainty around the possible impact on consumer spending trends. Analysts have said that dollar stores could be poised to benefit as consumers trade down in the current environment. Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR), set to report its own results Wednesday morning, were up 6%. Shares of ON Semiconductor (ON) jumped 11% after the company's top executive discussed expectations for a recovery in demand. In a presentation at the Bank of America Technology Conference, Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury pointed to signs of recovery in the company's industrials market, its second largest, as well as indications that the automotive market could see a bottom in the second quarter. First Solar (FSLR) stock bounced 6.5% higher on Tuesday, reversing losses posted in the prior session. Shares of companies in the renewable energy space have come under pressure since the House passed a reconciliation bill that calls for the elimination of numerous clean energy initiatives and the Department of Energy cancelled an array of related grants. Mizuho analysts boosted their price target on the stock. Crude oil futures prices extended their recent string of gains, bolstered by increasing geopolitical tensions, including an escalation of the war in Ukraine and an uncertain outlook for a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. The price uptick helped lift oil and gas stocks, with shares of exploration and production firm APA Corp. (APA) gaining 5.4%. Shares of Kenvue (KVUE), the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, dropped 6.2%, the furthest of any S&P 500 stock. Kenvue CEO Thibaut Mongon suggested that a lagging transition from spring into winter had contributed to soft seasonal demand for allergy and sun protection products. FactSet Research Systems (FDS) shares sank 4.8% after the financial data and software provider announced that Sanoke Viswanathan, formerly an executive at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), would take the reins as CEO starting in September. Current CEO Phil Snow is set to retire and exit his position on FactSet's board of directors at that time.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Buy on the dip, purchase stock when price drop, trader signal to invest, make profit from market ... More collapse concept, smart businessman investor buy stock with down arrow graph. We’ve got a rare “delayed reaction” income play on our hands right now. Thanks to the April stock-market plunge, we can now pick up 12%+ dividends at attractive discounts. But I don’t expect this cheap CEF opportunity to last very long. I know early April feels like a while ago, but it created our opportunity, and the chance to buy is still available today. It lies in closed-end funds (CEFs). (I’ll show you three that pay those outsized 12%+ yields in just a second.) In a nutshell, these three funds trade at discounts to their portfolio values—known as “net asset value,” or NAV, in CEF-speak. And many of those discounts still haven’t recovered from the April “tariff terror.” When we buy a CEF at, say, a 10% discount to NAV, we’re essentially paying 90 cents on the dollar. As that gap narrows, we essentially profit twice: once from the fund’s high yield and again from the closing discount. Here’s the important part: These discounts are on the road to recovery. And their “discount momentum” positions us for gains, in addition to these three funds’ double-digit payouts. You simply won’t find such a profitable situation in the S&P 500. While the benchmark index has clawed its way back to around breakeven for 2025, the three funds we’ll get into next are still lagging, and that’s a gift for income investors like us. Let’s get into them. Our first fund is the Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR), with a 12.5% yield and a still-cheap valuation that’s unlikely to stay that way for long. JFR Discount NAV As you can see above, JFR’s discount plunged to within a hair of 12% when President Trump’s tariffs were unveiled. That deal has since been cut nearly in half, to 6.7%. That might make you think it’s too late to buy. Not at all—JFR’s discount hasn’t fully snapped back to where it was at the start of the year, so there’s still upside here. And the discount will likely fade, because JFR has had a great run. With a 31% total return in the last three years, JFR is bound to attract more investor attention, putting those who front run that crowd now in a strong position to gain. JFR mainly invests in senior loans, as well as corporate bonds that are below investment grade, with a focus on floating-rate credit. You do need skilled management to navigate these waters, but Chicago-based Nuveen, which traces its roots back to 1898, is among the best in the business. Moreover, senior loans are repaid ahead of all other obligations in the event of a bankruptcy, which helps offset their risk. But that’s not really an issue now, since corporate defaults are below their long-term average, despite the heavy markdown corporate bonds suffered in 2022, when investors thought they would see huge defaults. Since floating-rate loans (whose rates, as the name says, are linked to interest rates) still haven’t fully recovered from that selloff, they’re particularly compelling now, while default rates remain low. In all, JFR gives us a well-designed bond portfolio to diversify our holdings. The income and discount make the deal even sweeter. For something a bit more familiar, consider another Nuveen CEF: the Nuveen Multi-Asset Income Fund (NMAI). NMAI mixes investments in well-known stocks, like Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Apple (AAPL), with loans and bonds, resulting in a well-diversified portfolio that helps management cover the fund’s 13.6% dividend. Again, this diversification has been attracting investors, causing NMAI’s discount to dwindle. But we’re still getting a generous 9% markdown here. Investors who buy NMAI’s diversified portfolio get a big yield at a hefty markdown to the fund’s actual value; this is partly why the fund’s discount has been disappearing. This narrowing of the discount will likely continue, and good economic news could accelerate it, as we saw happen in June 2024 (the peak in the chart above). Let’s wrap with a “pure” stock fund packing a powerful 12.8% dividend: the abrdn Total Dynamic Dividend Fund (AOD). Like the two CEFs above, AOD is attracting more investment, which we can see happening in real time through its shrinking discount: AOD Discount NAV Still, AOD trades for far less than NAV, with a 9.7% discount that makes little sense given the fund’s huge yield and large cap holdings, like Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tencent Holdings (TNCT). It also makes little sense for an investor to be able to get these stocks at such a big discount, which explains why that deal has been eroding. The bottom line here is that these 12%+ yielders are still catching up in the wake of April’s panic, making them worth a look for those with extra cash to put to work. But their shrinking discounts show the crowd is catching on, so you’ll need to act fast. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Latest Debt Downgrade Is Our Shot At Cheap 9% Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. UKRAINE - 2021/03/22: In this photo illustration, the stock market information of Moodys Investors ... More Service seen displayed on a smartphone with the Moodys logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) This latest US debt downgrade is a buying opportunity for us contrarians. I say that because we had the same (profitable) setup the last three times the ratings agencies took Uncle Sam’s credit rating down a peg. You might find that last sentence surprising. Three times? Indeed, the US government has seen its debt downgraded on three different occasions: 2011, 2023 and most recently a couple of weeks ago. You can be forgiven for not remembering all of these: In some cases (2023 comes to mind), they didn’t really make headlines. In others, they set up a small dip in stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds yielding 8%+) that was well worth buying. Let’s go through all three occasions and see what they can tell us. We’ll also look at how they affected the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in my CEF Insider service. ADX pays a roughly 9% dividend as I write this and sports a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of around 8%. The fund holds some of the biggest (and most credit-worthy!) US stocks, like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V), not to mention top-quality lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Let’s start in August 2011, when debt-ceiling wrangling in Congress prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade US government debt. At the time, this move was historic: No agency had ever downgraded the US government’s credit, which was considered incredibly safe. What happened next? US long-term Treasuries (in blue below) surged some 20% from the day of the downgrade through the end of 2011. The S&P 500 (in orange) also had a good run, returning nearly 6% over those few months. ADX (in purple) trailed behind, but as we’ll see next, this lag made it the best opportunity of the three. ADX 2011 Buying the S&P 500 was clearly a smart move here. But playing the contrarian and buying bonds after the downgrade delivered even faster returns. Over the long run, however, it was ADX (in purple below) that won out, with dividends reinvested: ADX Total Returns Now let’s look at the next downgrade, in August 2023. This time it was Fitch that cut Uncle Sam to the agency’s second-highest rating. ADX 2023 ADX (in purple above) has returned about 44% since then, as of this writing, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 30% gain (in orange). Meantime, Treasuries (in blue) are in the red. Why the difference in government-bond action between this downgrade and the first one? That’s another article on its own, but suffice it to say, it had more to do with slower-than-expected Fed rate cuts than the downgrade. The most recent downgrade, just a couple weeks ago, did cause a dip in stocks, ADX and bonds, however—though ADX has fallen the least as I write this. These declines are likely the result of tariff uncertainty, which has caused more anxiety than we saw in late 2023, when stocks were recovering from the 2022 pullback. ADX 2025 As you can see above, all three stayed flat until falling a little on May 20, then falling sharply the next day, when Walmart warned about price increases (and therefore lower consumer spending), and Target reported disappointing sales. The smart money did not sell when the news was first released on the 16th, but we are probably seeing more selling pressure as the retailers’ warnings have added anxiety. In the coming days, we could see stocks go flat or slightly negative if the sour attitude sticks around. But that would be a buying opportunity—especially for equity CEFs like ADX—similar to the openings we saw in 2023 and 2011. Another important point: the downgrade doesn’t impact all US assets. In its announcement, Moody’s makes clear that the downgrade impacts America’s “long-term issuer and senior unsecured” debt, but “the US long-term local- and foreign-currency country ceilings remain at Aaa.” In other words, the downgrade applies to US Treasuries greater than one year in duration (government bonds, basically, up to and including 30-year issues). Those bonds now have the second-highest rating from all three ratings agencies. At the same time, non-government debt issuers in the US can still have the top rating—including American companies. In fact, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) still have the Aaa rating from Moody’s. (Note that ADX holds Apple and Microsoft, so it’s a good pick if you’re still concerned about credit quality.) Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
