We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert.

JPMorgan Chase expects that potential Solana (SOL) and XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could see multi-billion dollar inflows. VanEck’s head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel reports on the social media platform X that JPMorgan says SOL and XRP ETFs could attract up to $16 billion in total. “SOL & XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) Could Attract $3-8bn Each: JPM ETP assets ($108bn) make up 6% of the total Bitcoin market cap ($1,874bn) after the ETPs’ first year of trading; likewise, ether ETP assets ($12bn) have a 3% penetration rate of the total Ethereum market cap ($395bn) within its first 6 months since launch. When applying these so-called “adoption rates” to SOL and XRP, we see SOL attracting roughly $3-6bn of new net assets and XRP gathering $4-8bn in net new assets.” Last year, the chief executive of VanEck said that a Solana ETF could only be possible if the Republicans won the US Presidential Election. And last winter, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said it “makes sense” for an XRP ETF to eventually be approved. “I think it makes sense that there will be other ETFs. It’s sort of like the earliest days of the stock market – you don’t really want exposure to one stock, or one company, you want to typically think about diversifying risk and what have you. I think we will see other [crypto] ETFs. When we will see them is hard to predict. The sad reality of what we saw with the Bitcoin ETF is [it happened] only because the courts forced the SEC’s hand, and really [SEC Chair] Gary Gensler’s hand.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/Redshinestudio/Sensvector Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: NYSE:JPM) has revealed a series of executive role shifts following Daniel Pinto's decision to retire as President and Chief Operating Officer at the end of 2026. Pinto will step down from his current roles on June 30, 2025, and transition to Vice Chairman, where he will continue to advise CEO Jamie Dimon and other senior executives. Jennifer Piepszak, previously Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Commercial & Investment Bank (CIB), has been appointed as the new Chief Operating Officer, effective immediately. Piepszak will assume responsibility for Technology, Operations, Chief Administrative Office, Data & Analytics, Corporate Strategy, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. She will also oversee the firm's Global Corporate Centers in India and the Philippines. Doug Petno, formerly Co-head of Global Banking, is set to replace Piepszak as Co-CEO of the CIB, alongside Troy Rohrbaugh. John Simmons will step into Petno's previous position and join Filippo Gori as the new Co-head of Global Banking. Marianne Lake and Mary Erdoes will maintain their current roles as CEO of Consumer and Community Banking and CEO of Asset & Wealth Management, respectively. All Corporate functions will be jointly managed by Piepszak and Dimon. Jamie Dimon praised Pinto for his "exceptional job" and "outstanding stewardship" during his tenure, which spans over 40 years. Pinto expressed pride in the team and the company's achievements, committing to support JPMorgan Chase in the future. This executive reshuffle comes as the financial services firm continues to lead in various sectors, including investment banking and asset management. The company reported $4.2 trillion in assets and $346 billion in stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2024, serving a broad spectrum of customers under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands. With a P/E ratio of 13.5 and impressive revenue growth of 13.9% over the last twelve months, JPM has demonstrated strong performance.

Get the complete picture with InvestingPro's comprehensive research report, available along with detailed financial metrics and expert analysis.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst David Konrad raised the price target for the bank to $257, citing higher net interest income and capital markets revenues. Meanwhile, Truist Securities initiated coverage of JPMorgan with a Hold rating, recognizing the bank's financial performance and robust balance sheet. Additionally, BofA Securities raised its price target for JPMorgan to $280, expecting a resurgence in net interest income growth due to anticipated higher interest rates. Wolfe Research analyst Steven Chubak upgraded JPMorgan's stock rating from Peer Perform to Outperform, emphasizing the bank's strength in the Universal Broker and Trust sector.

In legal matters, JPMorgan has been sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over alleged failure to protect consumers from fraud on the Zelle network. However, the bank has resolved its dispute with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., with both parties agreeing to drop their claims. Furthermore, Michele G. Buck, the CEO of The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), has been elected to JPMorgan's board of directors. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: The Trump stock market rally is fading fast

The S&P 500 is close to erasing all the gains it notched since Donald Trump’s election victory. As of market close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up just 0.92% since Nov. 5 — the day Trump clinched a second term in the White House and set off a stock market rally. S&P 500 futures were up 0.27% early Tuesday, pointing to a potential bounce back after sinking 0.77% so far in January. But if the index continues to close lower through Inauguration Day next Monday, it could represent the worst performance for the S&P 500 between Election Day and a presidential inauguration since 2009, when Barack Obama first took office during the Great Recession, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group reported by CNBC. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has also pared back its post-election gains in recent weeks, and is now only 0.18% higher than Nov. 5. That index is down 0.85% so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is still up 3.52% since Election Day, although it has also seen some moderation in returns. A slump in tech stocks on Monday, including Nvidia (NVDA+3.20%) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.72%), following new Biden administration rules governing the sale of AI chips, sent the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lower. In 2025, the Nasdaq has also slumped 1.63%. Dow futures were up 115 points in pre-market trading Tuesday, while Nasdaq futures ticked up 0.33%. In the aftermath of the election, major U.S. indexes hit new records in a Trump-fueled market rally, with the Dow hitting 44,000 for the first time in its 128-year history and the S&P 500 crossing the 6,000 mark.
