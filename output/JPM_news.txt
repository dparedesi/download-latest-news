JP Morgan headquarters at Canary Wharf financial district on 5th November 2024 in London, United ... [+] Kingdom. (photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has gained about 48% year-to-date, compared to the 28% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. JPMorgan’s peer Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is up by an even stronger 50% YTD. Let’s take a look at JPM’s recent performance and outlook. JPMorgan outperformed street expectations in the third quarter of FY 2024. The bank reported total revenues of $42.7 billion, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. Net interest income was slightly higher compared to last year, due to changes in the balance sheet mix, higher credit card balances, as well as wholesale deposits. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? Non-interest revenue, excluding the markets segment, grew by a strong 17% led by higher asset management fees as well as an improved investment banking performance. However, net income was down by about 2% compared to last year at $12.9 billion on account of higher provisions for credit losses. As an aside, why is VALE down 40% this year? See What’s Happening With VALE Stock? Admirably, JPM stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, -13% in 2022, and 31% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, what’s the outlook like for JPMorgan? Separately, see why Citi stock is also having a good year in Why Citi Stock Is Up 40% This Year. Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve in Q4 driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. Separately, the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term is also expected to benefit the financial sector at large. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, and lending activity, as well as possibly lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts, which could also help the bottom lines of banks such as JPMorgan. Republicans, who generally favor free markets, have won control of the Senate and the House of Representatives as well. Overall, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase. While JPMorgan remains one of the highest quality names in the banking space, with considerable scale, we believe the stock is overvalued. JPM stock trades at over 2.5x tangible book value (company’s net assets, less goodwill) which is elevated in our view. Overall, at its current price of $245 per share, JPM is trading about 15% ahead of Trefis’ estimate for JPMorgan’s valuation.

The increased size of leveraged MicroStrategy (MSTR) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the flows they attract are having a more pronounced effect on the company's stock and crypto markets than before, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday. These ETFs played a significant role in amplifying the stock's near-60% rise in November, the bank said. November saw a record of almost $11 billion flow into U.S. spot bitcoin (BTC), spot ether (ETH) and leveraged MicroStrategy ETFs combined, the report said, with the leveraged MSTR ETFs accounting for $3.4 billion, or almost a third, of the total. "This highlights the rising impact of MicroStrategy's leveraged ETFs in crypto markets via facilitating MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchase program," analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. The company founded by Michael Saylor has spent $13 billion buying bitcoin this quarter alone, the report noted. "The growth in these ETFs is fuelled by increasing investor demand in obtaining amplified exposure to bitcoin through an ETF wrapper," the authors wrote, adding that this would not normally be available to retail investors. MicroStrategy shares allow investors who are restricted from investing in spot bitcoin ETFs to obtain exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency, and due to the software company's inclusion in benchmarks such as the MSCI World index, the stock benefits from sizable passive flows. The company's share price also reflects investor optimism about the potential profitability of MicroStrategy's corporate strategy, including its plans to become a bitcoin bank and develop BTC applications, and this adds a premium to the firm's valuation, the report added. MicroStrategy currently meets the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index, according to Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer.
