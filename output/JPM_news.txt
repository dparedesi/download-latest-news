ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster Contributor. Investment asset allocation and rebalance concept. In our Thursday article, we talked about a “quiet shift” in the markets, from growth stocks to value—and we named 2 CEFs yielding 9%+ that are primed to profit from it. Yes, the recent jump in volatility is a big reason for that. So today, we’re going to look at another side of the rotation we’re seeing—a shift from passive investing to active. As we move further into 2025, it’s getting clearer to me that we’re into a stock-picker’s market. Sitting in an index fund just won’t cut it. That said, at my CEF Insider service, we’re still bullish on stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds, many of which hand us 8%+ yields), and we’ll get into two stock-focused funds, along with another that holds preferred stocks—kind of a stock/bond hybrid—below. Because there’s no question that success in this market will require active management—moving into, and out of, the right stocks and sectors at the right times. Of course, many mainstream investors aren’t interested in that—it’s too much work. Which is why I’m betting that many of them are likely to give CEFs a closer look as we move further into 2025. As they do, they’ll discover what we’ve known at CEF Insider for years: CEFs let you sit back and collect high yields (and price upside) while “farming out” picking the actual investments to a professional human manager. That makes now a great time to pick up some well-run CEFs as active management (finally) regains appeal. Doing so lets us buy our CEFs at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), especially in the wake of the recent selloff. Then, as more investors pile in, we get to ride along as those discounts shrink, pulling our CEFs’ market prices higher as they do. Which brings me back to those three CEFs I mentioned off the top—the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG)—a CEF Insider holding—the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW) and the Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred and Income Securities Fund (FFC). All are trading at discounts and boast dividends that are either sky-high (9.4% in the case of ASG) or set to grow (like STEW’s 4%-yielding payout). ASG is a multi-manager fund that invests in large-, mid- and small-cap growth stocks. This means it leverages the knowledge of experts in different sectors (tech, financial, etc.), as well as experts with experience investing in big companies, small companies and everything in between. ASG is interesting now because, in a sense, it gives us two discounts. The first is the fund’s discount to NAV, which is 7.9% as I write this, even though the fund has delivered an 8.4% annualized total return over the last decade, based on its market price, as of this writing. That 7.9% discount is well below its five-year average of 1%, which is our first discount here. The other one is on the fund’s stocks themselves, and we can see the recent dip in those by looking at its NAV performance, including dividends. That’s entirely the result of the last few weeks of volatility: ASG Total Returns Meantime, ASG offers a rich 9.4% dividend yield. Unlike ETFs, which typically provide minimal yield, ASG’s managed-distribution policy (meaning ASG management can raise or lower payouts depending on what’s best for the fund’s long-term returns. Moreover, ASG’s overall yield is actually higher than it looks, since management regularly pays special dividends. ASG Dividend With a discount to NAV and a dip in its portfolio performance, ASG is set up to gain as more investors “farm out” their stock picking. Buy it now and we could collect that 9.4% “base” payout in the meantime. Next up is the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), which sports one of the biggest discounts in CEFs, at 23.1%. That’s wild when you consider that STEW delivered a tidy 12.7% annualized return over the last decade. Moreover, that 23.1% discount is nearly five percentage points wider than STEW’s long-term average of 18.2%. STEW Discount STEW’s top holdings include Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which comprises nearly 40% of the portfolio between the two share classes, as well as other well-known large caps, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and pipeline master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD). So, why is this fund trading at such a deep discount? Simply put: neglect. STEW doesn’t have the same name recognition as some larger CEFs. But with markets now rewarding active strategies and investors looking to large caps during this volatility, that’s set to change. STEW is also valuable because management can put 40% of their portfolio in stocks like BRK when they’re undervalued, while SEC rules limit passive funds to stick to no more than about 10% of their assets in any one holding. Once investors pick up on STEW’s strong performance and deep discount, the gap should narrow. And with a very well-covered dividend, you’re very likely to see higher payouts over time, building on the 4% yield you’d get on a buy made today. In fact, history strongly suggests that’s exactly what’ll happen here: STEW Dividend Just in the past five years, STEW’s payout has jumped 62%, and as you can see at the right of this chart, its payout growth is accelerating. That bodes well for anyone buying this bargain-priced CEF today. The Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Securities Income Fund (FFC) holds preferred shares, which trade on an exchange, like stocks, and represent ownership in a company. But their price movements are more like those of bonds. And, like bonds, they’re sensitive to interest rates. More on that in a second. Banks and insurance companies are the main issuers of preferreds, which is why 54% of FFC’s portfolio consists of financial services firms, with preferreds from the likes of Wells Fargo and MetLife. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re considering how FFC fits into your overall portfolio weighting. Beyond that, the fund is a good way to pick up a basket of preferreds and lock in a 6.8% yield while doing so. FFC Dividend Above you can see the rate sensitivity of FFC’s dividend in action, with the payout moving lower as rates rose in 2022 and 2023, then steadying and rising as rates topped out and began to move lower (along with a special dividend late last year). Here’s what makes FFC particularly interesting now: It historically trades at a premium to NAV of 1%, but it’s currently at a 5.8% discount. That’s a big break from its norm, and it’s unlikely to last. Preferred securities tend to do well when rates are stabilizing, and that’s where we are now, with Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell saying he’s content to hold off on further cuts until the effects of Trump administration policies (especially around tariffs) become clearer. Even so, the latest projections from the Federal Open Market Committee do still indicate that two rate cuts are expected in 2025, probably toward the end of the year. When that happens, preferreds will benefit, and funds like FFC are likely to see renewed interest—which I see pushing the fund’s discount back toward a premium. That leaves us with FFC’s 6.8% dividend (with potential for more payout growth) to collect while we wait. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Tesla's first-quarter deliveries are likely to miss the mark, according to analysts

Tesla (TSLA+3.99%) investors should brace themselves for first-quarter sales that fail to impress, analysts say, as the backlash over Elon Musk’s politics and his role in mass layoffs take a toll on the company. Analysts on average expect Tesla on Wednesday to report deliveries of 408,000 electric vehicles for the January to March quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.17%). Several analysts have downgraded their expectations to below 400,000 in recent weeks, as domestic protests against Tesla have raged and international sales slumped. Deutsche Bank (DB+0.63%) analysts last week reduced its first-quarter forecast by about 50,000 units to 345,000 deliveries, which would translate to an 11% year-over-year drop and a 30% decrease from the previous quarter. Deutsche also lowered its full-year estimate to 1.7 million units sold from 2.1 million units, a 5% decline compared to 2024. Tesla has forecasted a “return to growth” in 2025 after narrowly missing its 2024 sales goal and recording its first annual sales decline. In October, Musk forecasted sales growth of 30% for 2025. “The main drivers of the downside are weakness in Europe and the Model Y Juniper changeover,” analysts led by Edison Yu said, referring to Tesla’s updated electric SUV. Tesla’s sales in the European Union fell 49% in January and February compared to a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association, with just 19,000 units registered. JATO Dynamics found that registrations of Tesla’s best-selling Model Y and Model 3 fell by 65% and 14%, respectively, in February. In China, where domestic automakers including BYD (BYDDY-2.60%) and Xiaomi (XIACF-5.69%) are growing their share of the market and electrified-vehicle sales are soaring, Tesla’s sales fell 49% year-over-year in February. The firm sold 30,688 vehicles, its lowest monthly figure since July 2022. Tesla has struggled to launch its advanced driver assistance technology in China, even as BYD plans to attach its “God’s Eye” software to just about all vehicles it sells. Some Chinese automakers are also able to sell their cars for dirt cheap. In the U.S., RBC Capital Markets (RY+0.60%) thinks Tesla will report 152,000 vehicles sold, according to a March 27 note. Analysts expect to see sales slammed by the recent string of protests against Tesla, which organizers view as an extension of Musk and his influence. Thousands have joined the “Takedown Tesla” demonstrations organized to protest Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, while critical owners of Tesla stock — and other investors fearing a crash — have been selling their shares. Acts of vandalism against Tesla facilities and vehicles have become more frequent, even pushing Tesla out of a major Canadian auto show whose organizers were worried about backlash. Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA-0.64%) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 34% year-to-date, sending Musk’s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. Shares are down almost 6% in intraday trading on Monday. “We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” JPMorgan (JPM-0.73%) analysts recently wrote of DOGE’s impact on Tesla. But it’s still unclear how much that brand damage — which began with Musk’s support of Trump during the 2024 election — will impact sales. Deutsche analysts, for example, noted that they believe “there is some level of brand damage” happening in Western Europe and “pockets” of the U.S. and Canada, but quantifying it is trickier to tell. Musk’s years-long shift toward the right wing had already irritated some potential customers with opposing views. In EV-friendly California, traditionally Tesla’s biggest domestic market, sales have dropped for five straight quarters. Just 13% of Democrats would consider buying a Tesla, according to a February Morning Consult poll. Conservatives, meanwhile, have embraced Musk; Trump has bought himself a Model S and his administration has promised to treat people vandalizing Tesla facilities as domestic terrorists. It’s still unclear how their support will translate into sales. Tesla will report its sales on Wednesday just hours before Trump’s planned 25% tariffs on vehicle imports will go into effect. The tariff will be extended to impact imported auto parts no later than May 3. That will affect just about every major automaker selling cars in the U.S., including Tesla, and may negatively impact sales. Musk has said the cost impact of the tariffs will not be “trivial” and that Tesla won’t be left unscathed. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on a January earnings call that the tariffs will hit the company’s business and profitability. In a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Tesla said that even with “aggressive” localization of the supply chain, some parts are “difficult or impossible” to source domestically. Between 60% and 75% of the parts used in Tesla’s electric vehicles are made in the U.S., although that varies by model. “[I]t is becoming crystal clear this tariff/U.S. policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a US consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a Monday note. “The winner in our view from this tariff is no one....as even Tesla still is clearly hit from these tariffs and will be forced to raise prices,” Ives, a major Tesla bull, added.

VodafoneIdea says, Govt to convert dues into equity, to get shares worth Rs 36,950 cr at an issue price of Rs 10/sh --Govt’s holding to increase to 49% from 22.6% --Promoters will continue to have operation control of the company Macroeconomic Data Releases: The HSBC India Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for March, due on April 4, will provide insights into the health of India’s manufacturing and services sectors. A strong PMI reading could lift market sentiment, while a weaker-than-expected figure might dampen it. Auto sales data for March, typically released by companies early in the month, will be in focus. Given the festive season’s tail-end effects and economic activity, robust sales numbers could support auto stocks and broader market indices. Global Economic Influences: Key U.S. economic data, including the Composite PMI and Initial Jobless Claims, expected during the week, could sway global markets, including India. Strong U.S. data might bolster confidence, while signs of weakness could fuel volatility, especially amid ongoing tariff concerns. The looming U.S. reciprocal tariffs, set to be detailed on April 2, are a significant wildcard. Proposed by the Trump administration, these tariffs (e.g., 25% on auto imports) could impact Indian exporters, particularly in the auto and manufacturing sectors, potentially triggering a cautious market response. Domestic Market Dynamics: Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) flows will remain critical. After being net sellers of ₹1.4 lakh crore in FY25 so far (as of late March), any shift in FII behavior—driven by global cues or domestic data—could move indices like the Sensex and Nifty. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) next monetary policy decision is slated for April, with speculation of a 25-basis-point repo rate cut. While the decision itself falls outside next week, any preemptive signals or market expectations could influence sentiment. Corporate and Sectoral Updates: The last day of the financial year (March 31) will see final portfolio adjustments, potentially affecting stock closing prices. This could lead to heightened volatility on Monday. Early Q4 earnings updates or guidance from companies might start trickling in, setting the tone for sector-specific movements. Technical and Sentiment Factors: The Nifty’s recent performance, closing below key levels like 23,550 (as noted in some analyses), suggests bearish pressure. Market participants will watch if it holds above 23,500 or tests lower supports around 22,400, as predicted by some traders. In summary, the Indian stock market next week will likely be shaped by a mix of domestic economic indicators (PMI, auto sales), global developments (U.S. data, tariffs), and technical levels. Investors might adopt a wait-and-see approach, balancing optimism from potential rate cut expectations against risks from international trade tensions. Keep an eye on these events as they unfold for a clearer picture. There are sectors in which it may make sense to chase expensive stocks; Power is not one of them. Indian electric utilities and IPPs face structural power demand growth and a much tighter demand-supply balance for peak power. This is leading to an expanded thermal capex opportunity (benefiting NTPC) and transmission capex opportunity (benefiting PGCIL). The industry has consolidated after a brutal decade in the 2010s, which saw many bankruptcies, leaving the survivors to benefit from rebounding growth. However, power is a tough sector – multiple challenges persist, such as the weak financial health of DISCOMs, delays in the signing of renewable PPAs, the usual execution delays and regulatory interventions. Post-Covid, stocks have re-rated sharply due to strong power demand growth, the resolution of DISCOM payment delays and high trading multiples accorded to renewable growth prospects. The correction in valuations over the past six months has reduced the ‘froth’ in valuations, putting the valuations of regulated utilities (NTPC & PGCIL) in an acceptable zone, in our view. However, we find private IPP/utility valuations still somewhat expensive, especially given execution challenges. We initiate coverage of NTPC and PGCIL at OW, Tata Power and Torrent Power at Neutral, and JSWEL at UW. 📌Piramal Pharma - Out of the 151 molecules in various stages of development, 12 are in preclinical, 68 in Phase-I trials, 38 in Phase-II trials, and 33 are in Phase-III clinical trials.
