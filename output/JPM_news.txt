Stocks’ losses eased after data showed the labor market holding up and fourth-quarter economic growth was revised higher. The good news helped temper the impact of Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts — which sent General Motors (GM+0.58%) and some peers down. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated after fourth-quarter GDP growth was revised up 2.4% annually from 2.3%, reflecting higher investment and a downward revision to import growth. New filings for jobless benefits remained steady in the week to March 22, as did continuing claims for the priror week. “Hard to see recession in these data, but the real test will be the initial read on Q1 2025 GDP, when the trade shocks feed into the numbers — that may not look so rosy,” Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an email. “The labor market is far stronger and resilient than folks appreciate.” Automakers weren’t a big beneficiary of the batter data, as they face higher costs under Trump’s tariffs that they’ll either have to absorb or pass on to customers. JPMorgan (JPM+0.78%) downgraded its price targets for GM, Ford (F+3.38%) and Ferrari (RACE-0.16%). GM stock plunged 6.5%, Ford declined 2%, and Stellantis (STLA-0.84%) fell 1.5%. The U.S.-traded shares of some foreign automakers slid, with Toyota (TM-1.24%) and Honda (HMC-0.46%) both falling more than 2%. Ferrari reversed an earlier decline after saying it’ll raise American prices for its cars by up to 10% after the tariffs go into effect April 2. Tesla (TSLA-2.08%), one of the automakers least affected by the tariffs, rebounded from initial lows to trade more than 3% higher. Elon Musk said the electric vehicle makers, which relies on some imported parts, will take a hit from the tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA-1.87%) stock slid about 1.2% after dropping 5.7% yesterday. Beijing has asked firms in China to use energy-efficient chips in data centers, the Financial Times reported on March 25. GameStop (GME+2.58%) plunged 25%, more than surrendering its gain yesterday after it announced plans to raise $1.3 billion by selling convertible senior notes due 2030 to finance Bitcoin investments. Jefferies (JEF+2.33%) stock plunged more than 9% after the investment bank’s quarterly earnings missed expectations, with revenue 14.5% below the StreetAccount consensus forecast and earnings per share 39% lower. Concentrix (CNXC-1.79%) stock jumped 37% after the outsourcing company’s quarterly per-share profit of $2.79 exceeded expectations by about 8.1%, and CEO Chris Caldwell used the earnings call to express confidence in the firms AI strategy. —With reporting by William Gavin Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Ferrari's luxury cars are about to get more expensive, thanks to Trump's tariffs

American buyers of Ferrari’s (RACE-0.16%) luxury vehicles will soon have to pay higher prices, as the Italian automaker looks to offset the burden of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The Trump administration’s new 25% tariffs on all imports of finished cars and trucks and of auto parts are set to go into effect on April 3. Almost half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, as are almost 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the U.S. Ferrari said Thursday that the impact of the tariffs would be partially reflected in its pricing for almost all imports after April 2. Excluding imports of Ferrari 297, SF90, and Roma vehicles, new cars could become as much as 10% more expensive. Some 40% of Ferrari’s global sales come from the U.S. market. “And while Ferrari demand may prove amongst the least elastic to moderate changes in price...Ferrari purchases are arguably amongst the most discretionary also, and so we could envision some buyers electing to delay taking delivery,” JPMorgan (JPM+0.78%) analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a Thursday note. Analysts at Bernstein (AB-0.10%) led by Stephen Reitman argued in a Thursday note that U.S. customers won’t be pushed away by higher prices. Ferrari’s customers tend to be wealthier individuals who will be less impacted by tariffs, which put more pressure on poorer consumers. “We are hard-pressed to think of any customer cohort in the U.S. that is better placed than Ferrari’s to absorb higher prices,” the Bernstein analysts said. “Any increase in new prices will be somewhat cushioned by the knowledge that the customer’s other Ferraris in their garage have seen their values rise.” JPMorgan lowered its December 2025 price target for Ferrari by 12%, to $460 per share from $525 per share, while Bernstein maintained an outperform rating on the stock. Ferrari stock is up by almost 2% and trades at $421 per share. Ferrari said its financial targets for 2025 will remain unchanged. The company has forecast adjusted earnings of at least 2.68 billion euros ($2.88 billion), an increase of at least 5%, and net revenue of more than 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for the full year. Ferrari recorded net profit of 1.53 billion euros ($1.6 billion) and revenue of 6.7 billion euros ($7.2 billion) in 2024. That’s an increase of 21% and 12%, respectively, compared to 2023.

Title: JPMorgan drops its price target for Ford, GM, and Ferrari as Trump's 'draconian' tariffs loom

General Motors’ (GM+0.58%), Ford Motor’s (F+3.38%), and Ferrari’s (RACE-0.16%) earnings are likelier than ever to take a hit, as President Donald Trump’s “draconian” tariffs and anti-electric vehicle policies hang over the automakers, according to JPMorgan (JPM+0.78%) analysts. The Trump administration’s new 25% tariffs on all imports of parts and finished cars and trucks are set to go into effect on April 3. Almost half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, as are almost 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the U.S. “Anybody who has plants in the United States, it’s going to be good for,” Trump said Wednesday of his tariffs. JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman lowered their December price target for GM to $53 per share from $64 per share, for Ford to $11 per share from $13 per share, and for Ferrari to $460 per share from $525 per share, according to a Thursday note. GM stock dropped 3% on Wednesday as Trump made his auto tariff announcement, then slipped as much as 6.5% on Thursday. Ferrari’s stock slid almost 5% on Wednesday but rose 1.6% on Thursday. Ford shares are down 2%. The S&P 500 Automobiles sub-index is up almost 2%, but down 28% year-to-date. Automakers had received a brief break from Trump’s earlier 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada after the president said all vehicles covered by the USMCA trade pact would not be subject to duties for one month. That exemption, which primarily benefitted companies like GM and Ford, ends next week. JPMorgan expects GM to face a $10.5 billion tariff bill, which could rise to $13 billion over time. The automaker imports vehicles from South Korea, Canada, and Mexico. Ford’s bill will be much lower, $2 billion to start, but will gradually rise to $4.5 billion. The analysts now expect the auto industry to take a $82 billion annual hit, up from an initial estimate of $41 billion, assuming that automakers absorb the cost of the tariffs. If they decide to pass the costs on to consumers, light-vehicle prices could rise by up to 11.4%. The Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group previously estimated that a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canadian imports would add between $4,000 and $10,000 per unit to vehicles assembled in North America. Trump’s tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel add another $250 to $800 per gas-powered vehicle and up to $2,500 on EVs. “Under the new scheme virtually all automakers will face significant pressure to raise prices, making it more likely domestic automakers will be able to effect price increases to better offset tariff costs without the risk of material market share loss,” Brinkman said in the note. Ferrari on Thursday became the first automaker to raise prices in response to Trump’s new tariff threat. The Italian company said exports to the U.S. after the tariffs take effect will be priced up by as much as 10%. However, exports of Ferrari 296, SF90, and Roma vehicles will not be subject to higher prices. The tariffs are expected to stick around. When asked how long the duties would likely stay in effect, Trump said they would be permanent. While practically all automakers have been making moves to lessen the effect of Trump’s tariffs, they still expect damage. “Let’s be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in February.
