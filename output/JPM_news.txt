ByMichael Foster, Contributor. I’m regularly struck by something American investors always seem to take for granted: The many choices we have available to gain financial independence. And investors in closed-end funds (CEFs) make the most of these choices. These high-yielding funds kick out 8%+ dividends on average, and the portfolio of my CEF Insider service, which helps investors make the most of CEFs, pays even more, with its 18 holdings paying a rich average yield of 9.4%. Plus, these funds offer stock-like upside, which makes them pretty much tailor-made for delivering financial freedom. We’ll sketch out how two specific CEFs can help you find your way to an earlier, richer retirement in a bit. But first, back to that embarrassment of choices I mentioned a second ago. Back in my 20s, when I was studying to get my PhD in Europe, I was told I had to pay into the national pension fund, and I would get that money back when I qualified for it. At that time, I qualified at 62, which seemed absurd—nearly 40 years for me (a severely underpaid academic!) to get back money I desperately needed today. But as it turns out, I was lucky. Europe’s mandatory retirement age is rising. Denmark, which currently has the oldest retirement age in Europe at 67, is raising that to 70. Germany, where a normal retirement age is currently 66, is discussing raising that to 73. Whether you like the life of a worker or not, I’m almost certain that you like having the ability to choose that life without having to worry about governments changing the rules on you mid-game. This lack of choice pushed me away from Europe in my 20s and led me back to America. Here’s what I found when I returned. This chart shows that the average American household has gone from $200k in savings in the 1980s to $1.2 million now—and, no, that isn’t due to inflation. That $200k in savings would be $535k in 2025 dollars, so more than half of the jump to $1.2 million is due to actual value being created. Of course, that wealth isn’t going everywhere. While all households have gotten richer on average, the top 0.1% of the population is attracting a greater proportion of overall wealth in the US, now near 14%. The ethics of this aside, it’s clear that the households that have more wealth now have more choices—about when to retire, where to live, what lifestyle to adopt and so on. In a way, it seems like Europeans have too little choice and Americans have so much that retirement investing can be tough for individual investors to navigate without either taking undue risks or locking themselves into weak returns. This is where CEFs come in, with their focus on assets from well-established companies. Plus their high yields almost act like a “mini-pension,” boosting your income without leaving you at the whim of the government. This is the way I viewed CEFs in my late 20s, when I began using their high dividends to get the income I needed to make the choices I wanted. I still view them this way. And in addition to their big dividends, these funds often chalk up strong returns, too, thanks in large part to their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). As these discounts—which only apply to CEFs, by the way—shrink, they put upward pressure on the fund’s price. And the best part is that CEFs are easy to buy, trading on public markets just like stocks. Consider the first CEF we’re looking at today, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX). It’s one of the oldest funds in the world, tracing its history back to the 19th century (and is a current CEF Insider holding, too). This one is about as blue chip as it gets, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) among its top holdings. What’s more—and this is the key part—ADX trades at an 8.3% discount to NAV as I write this, and that discount is in the sweet spot, cheaper than it was a few months ago but carrying momentum as it steams toward par. ADX has been paying dividends since before the Great Depression, and its 8.3% dividend yield is fully covered by the 13.3% total NAV return (or the return on its underlying portfolio) it’s enjoyed over the last decade. Moreover, ADX has delivered a 5,340% return to its shareholders, with dividends reinvested, since the late 1980s, when US household wealth just started to meaningfully tick higher. That kind of performance—coming our way at a discount and with an 8.3% dividend—is exactly what we want from our “mini-pension,” and ADX delivers. But, as I said, we do have choices here. And ADX isn’t the only US-stock-focused CEF that delivers a large income stream and has withstood the test of time. Another is the General American Investors Company (GAM), which was launched in 1927 and yielded an impressive 9.4% to investors in 2024. GAM also holds large caps, with Alphabet (GOOGL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings. And, like ADX, this fund’s market price–based return has been strong over the last decade—though not quite as strong as ADX—with a 14.4% annualized return. Moreover, GAM’s 9.3% discount sounds like a good deal, but that’s near its smallest-ever level, so we’re not rushing out to buy the fund today. But it is worth watching, and gets tempting when that discount drops to double digits. But the larger point remains: With high-yielding CEFs like these, we can start generating a meaningful income stream we can choose to use however we like.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are rising as investors monitor developments on U.S.-China trade tensions and digest strong earnings reports from major financial institutions; the Fed’s Beige Book will offer some economic insights amid a data blackout due to the federal government shutdown; ASML Holding shares are rising after the semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected quarterly income; and Jeep-maker Stellantis plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. production. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher after major indexes turned in a mixed performance yesterday amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 1% recently, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.8% and Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures added 0.5%. Gold futures were up more than 1% at $4,215 an ounce, as the precious metal continues hitting record highs amid economic uncertainty and stock market volatility. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was trading at $112,000, down from from an overnight high of $113,600 and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set early last week. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a variety of consumer loans, was holding steady at 4.02%, near a five-week low. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) this morning released quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations, joining several other major institutions that released strong earnings reports yesterday. Bank of America reported third-quarter revenue of $28.24 billion, better than the $27.5 billion expected from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $1.06 topped the consensus view of 95 cents. Morgan Stanley reported revenue of $18.2 billion, compared with the consensus estimate of $16.69 billion, while EPS of $2.80 came in above estimates of $2.11. Investors will be keeping tabs on what bank executives are saying about the outlook for their businesses after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Tuesday "of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation." Shares of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley were up more than 4% in recent premarket trading. With data releases delayed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week, investors will be closely watching today’s 2 p.m. ET release of the Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book.” The Beige Book provides a summary of economic conditions in each of the 12 regions of the Federal Reserve and is published two weeks before each Fed meeting, with the next scheduled for Oct. 28-29. While investors won’t get the Consumer Price Index report for September that was originally scheduled for release today, that report will be published on Oct. 24, as officials said that the data was needed to determine Social Security payment levels. ASML Holding (ASML) shares are rising in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker reported better-than-expected income and sought to reassure investors on 2026 sales, even as its third quarter sales came in below analysts' estimates. ASML reported quarterly revenue of 7.516 billion euros ($8.74 billion), compared with expectations of 7.67 billion euros ($8.92 billion) from analysts tracked by Visible Alpha. Net income of 2.125 billion euros ($2.47 billion) was above the analyst consensus of 2.083 billion ($2.42 billion). The company said it expected 2026 sales to exceed 2025 levels, but would provide more information in January. ASML warned in July that it couldn’t guarantee growth in 2026 due to ongoing trade tensions with China. ASML shares, which have gained more than 40% since the start of the year, rose more than 4% ahead of the bell. Big Three automaker Stellantis (STLA) said it would invest $13 billion into U.S. auto manufacturing over the next four years, the largest single investment in the company’s 100-year U.S. history. The investment will support the introduction of five new vehicles across the company’s brands, which includes Jeep and Chrysler, and the addition of 5,000 new jobs at plants in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. The automaker recently reported a rise in third-quarter U.S. sales, which snapped a two-year streak of year-over-year sales declines. Shares of Stellantis were up 0.5% in recent premarket trading.

Title: Are Leveraged ETFs to Blame for Selloffs? JPM Says Yes

Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com When markets tumble, everyone starts looking for a suspect, and leveraged ETFs could be next in the police lineup. JPMorgan analysts blamed levered ETFs for Friday’s stock selloff, which resulted in the S&P 500’s biggest one-day loss since April, in a research note published Monday. JPMorgan Managing Director Bram Kaplan said leveraged products will “likely trigger further systematic selling flows this week, leaving markets fragile.” Although the drop was triggered initially by President Donald Trump’s threat of new tariffs against China, the note estimated that roughly $26 billion of selloffs from leveraged ETFs worsened the decline. While experts agreed on the dangers posed to individual investors by leveraged funds, not everyone was convinced of their widespread risks. “I wouldn’t say that leveraged ETFs wholesale create systemic issues,” said Bryan Armour, Morningstar’s director of ETF and passive strategies. “But there definitely have been instances where they make things worse.” Leveraged ETFs are still relatively new to the scene, but the role they play in shaping macroeconomic trends might be outsized. Leveraged ETFs typically hold swaps instead of options. Because of the structure and high liquidity of swaps, their price can swing wildly, particularly in leveraged products, which promise 2x or 3x returns on underlying holdings. “Forced buying and selling when everyone knows roughly what they’re going to have to do can be very problematic,” Armour said. “It can increase volatility [and] hurt investors in the leveraged ETF, because then they have to sell lower and buy higher each day.” Still, there is reason to believe levered products aren’t all to blame: Ultimately, Armour doesn’t think the amount of assets these ETFs currently hold is significant enough to have much of an impact. The largest 3x leveraged product is the ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ), which only has around $29 billion in AUM, according to VettaFi data. Doesn’t Ring a Bell. The hope is that individuals will recognize the risks of these funds before buying into them, said Morningstar research analyst Lan Anh Tran. “It’s hard to tell where investors are interested in putting their money next,” she said. “With these leveraged or inverse leveraged ETFs, they blow up every once in a while, and then the next year, it seems people are going through a collective amnesia. They forget that that ever happened.” No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. © 2025 The Daily Upside
