After Friday’s big selloff as President Trump fired back at China’s tightening of rare earths export curbs with higher tariffs, investors will be watching closely for the latest trade policy developments. An ongoing federal government shutdown may delay the release of several economic reports, but investors can look forward to a full slate of corporate earnings from big banks and mainstays in the semiconductor industry. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and American Express are on the list of major financial firms set to report this week, while reports from TSMC, Johnson & Johnson, and United Airlines will also be in focus. Without a resolution to the budget dispute, the government shutdown will enter its third week, likely delaying the release of data on wholesale inflation, retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims. Homebuilder confidence and small business optimism surveys are still scheduled, and several Federal Reserve speakers are expected to deliver remarks, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The bond market is closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday (observed in some places as Indigenous Peoples Day), while major stock exchanges are open. The Federal Reserve system, major financial institutions, and many federal, state, and local government offices will be closed on Monday. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. This week is set to bring third-quarter updates from some of the world's biggest banks and top financial institutions, starting with Tuesday's release from JPMorgan Chase. The world’s largest bank by market capitalization has reported better-than-expected revenue in the year’s first two quarters, even as sales declined and net interest income came up short in its most recent report amid CEO Jamie Dimon’s warnings about "turbulence" in the economy. Others expected to release quarterly financials Tuesday include Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and CitiGroup. Reports from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to follow Wednesday, while Charles Schwab, Bank of New York Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp are scheduled for Thursday. Earnings from American Express, Truist Financial, and State Street are slated for Friday. The world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC, is set to report its results Thursday, after growing its revenue by 40% in the first half of 2025 on strong sales of AI chips. Chipmaking equipment maker ASML looks to report Wednesday after the Dutch firm raised worries about future growth amid tariff pressures. Also this week, cloud computing giant Oracle will host a three-day AI World conference beginning on Monday, and customer relationship management software firm Salesforce's Dreamforce event starts Tuesday. With the federal government shutdown heading into its third week, the blackout on economic data releases is likely to continue. The Thursday reports on U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims and Friday’s update on housing starts could be delayed by the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it plans to release on Oct. 24 the Consumer Price Index inflation report for September that was originally scheduled for release on Wednesday. Several Federal Reserve officials are also scheduled to speak, coming as the central bank is set to release its Beige Book economic update on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell is due to give an economic update on Tuesday, with remarks also expected this week from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Some data releases are still expected, including a survey of small business optimism on Tuesday and report on homebuilder confidence on Thursday.

Title: Things Are Getting Seriously Surreal in Milei’s Argentina
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/10/the-javier-milei-clown-show-reaches-its-grotesque-finale.html
Time Published: 2025-10-10T10:45:29Z
Full Content:
Javier Milei, the world’s first self-described anarcho-capitalist head of government, is reaching the halfway point of his four-year presidential term, and things are getting decidedly weird… The pinnacle of cringe is Milei larping as a rockster in a huge concert paid with state money to launch his book celebrating his 'economic miracle' while the peso implodes, the government is bankrupt, bonds are collapsing & his finance minister is in the US begging for a bailout https://t.co/CoJmg5F5Of — Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) October 7, 2025 Milei went through almost a dozen rock songs at Buenos Aires’ Movistar Arena, including Demoliendo Hoteles, by Charly García; Rock del Gato, by Ratones Paranoicos; and Blues del Equipaje, by Mississipi, before repudiating a recent anti-Semitic attack on a woman and her son in Buenos Aires. He then performed a rendition of the Hava Nagila, a Jewish folk song that Argentina’s Zionist president said particularly “bothers the left”. Milei has maintained his displays of unabashed support for Israel even as the Jewish State has intensified its genocidal campaign in Gaza and expanded its conflicts in the Middle East. The expressions on the faces of the largely Milei-friendly La Nación+ presenters as Milei sings his way through the Hava Nagila speak a thousand words: Corrompe una historia que no le pertenece. Nos ensucia. Se sube a nuestras costumbres para sentirse algo que no entiende con una levedad idiota que nadie entiende. Estás roto y enfermo Milei. pic.twitter.com/egaCHUi3lI — Ernesto Resnik (@ernestorr) October 7, 2025 Here is one of the best memes from the night: pic.twitter.com/SVwfFmIY9n — frix7z (@frix7z) October 7, 2025 Argentina, like so many parts of the so-called Western order, is living through a new age of stupidity. And as the German pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned before being executed by the Nazis in 1945, “stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice”: One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenceless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one’s prejudgment simply need not be believed — in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical — and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self-satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. Milei’s concert, intended as a celebration of the launch of his new book, “La construcción del milagro” (The Building of the Miracle), was at least partly state funded. It is also rumoured to have received financing from the Kovalivker family, which owns the company, Droguería Suizo Argentina, that was implicated in a recent kickbacks scandal involving Milei’s sister, Karina. The official launch of “The Building of the Miracle” took place against a backdrop of worsening economic and financial crisis. On average, 28 companies have folded each day of Milei’s 22-month presidency. Now another recession looms as global investment banks and multilateral lenders, including the World Bank, scurry to cut their rose-tinted growth projections for this year. The peso continues to dive while Argentina’s country risk premium, measured by JP Morgan, has climbed above 1,260. Brazil’s is at 187. The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic is still intervening daily in the currency markets to prop up the peso, burning through $1.5 billion in the previous six sessions. Short-term interest rates have also hit record highs of 80%, indicating a liquidity squeeze. This is all despite US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s pledge a couple of weeks ago to do whatever is needed to save the Argentine economy and currency. If he was hoping his words would have a Draghi-like effect on investor confidence, he must be bitterly disappointed. Putting the “Narco” in Anarcho-capitalism (h/t Saifedean Ammous) The concert also came just a couple of days after another major political scandal involving Milei’s party, La Libertad Avanza. The party’s top candidate for the all-important province of Buenos Aires in the upcoming mid-terms, José Luis Espert, had to pull out of the race over his ties (no need for the world “alleged”) to Federico “Fred” Machado, an Argentine businessman who is under arrest and facing extradition to the US on charges of cocaine trafficking. After weeks of denial, Espert finally admitted at the weekend that he had received $200,000 from Fred Machado in 2019. Machado has also claimed that he helped finance Espert’s 2019 presidential campaign. At that time, Espert was like a mentor to Milei, who was just starting out on his political career, and allegations were already swirling about Espert’s ties to Machado, including from the libertarian journalist Nicolás Moras. Milei spent the whole of last week defending Espert even as local media published more and more damning details of his links to Machado. After his former mentor finally admitted his guilt and announced his withdrawal from the race, Milei even shared a tweet proposing that Espert, a man who had just admitted taking money from an alleged drug trafficker, be made minister of security after the elections. So, in sum, the Trump administration is preparing a potentially open-ended bailout (because that is what it will probably end up being) to a government that was already bailed out by the IMF, the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank just six months ago. And that government, just like Ecuador’s US-aligned Noboa administration, has proven ties to drug traffickers. Meanwhile, the US is vaporising boats in the Caribbean Sea that it claims are carrying drugs without presenting a single shred of evidence. It is also escalating its threats against Venezuela, even warning of strikes against land targets. The hypocrisy of the US empire is endless: While the Trump admin threatens to invade Venezuela over bogus accusations of "drug trafficking", it is giving $20 billion to bail out Argentina's libertarian leader Milei, whose political ally from his party works with drug traffickers pic.twitter.com/3Z0GHWolGG — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) October 7, 2025 BREAKING: Colombian President Gustavo Petro says the latest ship bombed by the U.S. off Venezuela’s coast was a Colombian vessel carrying Colombian citizens.

The United States’ SDRs could be bought by the Federal Reserve (FED), and Caputo could access the USD 20 billion deposited in the Central Bank through a Non-Transferable Bill. On Thursday, Bessent confirmed the provision of the $20 billion swap-line as well as the US Treasury’s direct purchase of Argentina pesos, arguing that “the success of Argentina’s reform agenda is of systemic importance,” and that “a strong, stable Argentina which helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in the strategic interest of the United States. Their success should be a bipartisan priority.” So far, the impact of the intervention has been muted. The US Treasury is flat out buying pesos to prop up Milei's carry trade ponzi and the peso is only up 3% from its lowest level. https://t.co/kjx0deHWhL — Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) October 9, 2025 Meanwhile, opposition to the proposed bailout is growing in the legislative chambers of both countries. US soybean farmers — a key voting bloc for Trump — are also incensed that the White House is bailing out one of their chief rivals for the all-essential Chinese export market as they themselves lose access to that market as a result of Beijing’s retaliatory measures against Trump’s tariffs. Argentina’s farmers have jumped at the chance to fill the void. Now, the Trump administration is looking to bail out the Argentine government — for its own benefit of course, which we covered in some detail in our post, Washington’s Debt Trap Diplomacy and Election Meddling in Argentina. As Bessent said today in an interview with FOX News, the Trump administration sees this bailout as a means of avoiding another “China-led state in Latin America”. President @JMilei is trying to break 100 years of bad cycles in Argentina. He is a great ally of the U.S. and we look forward to his Oval Office visit next week. We do not want another failed or China-led state in Latin America. Stabilizing Argentina is America First. pic.twitter.com/UZEotUlaA9 — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) October 10, 2025 There could be an even darker reason — namely that Bessent is essentially bailing out Argentina in order to bail out his hedge-fund friends, including Rob Citrone, who invested heavily in Argentine assets, believing Milei would turn the economy around. Citrone formerly worked alongside Bessent as an investment manager at Soros Fund Management. Another potential beneficiary mentioned by the NYT is Stanley Druckenmiller. So the Argentine bailout wasn’t for Argentina as much as it was for a hedge fund friend of Scott Bessent. Rob Citrone a billionaire hedge fund guy who owns Discovery Capital, purchased Argentine debt and equity in numerous companies closely tied to the country’s overall economy.… — Prez (@PrezLives2022) October 9, 2025 This is all par for the course, of course. In previous bailouts of Argentina, most of the spoils have ended up going to financial speculators — or as the FT calls them, “wily currency traders”. The only difference this time is that the US Treasury is now being run by one: Individual traders snapped up $9.5bn from Argentina’s central bank from April to August in order to sell them for more pesos on a parallel exchange market, according to a report by Buenos Aires’ publicly owned Banco Provincia, cited by local brokerage One618. The purchases, equivalent to roughly half of the agricultural export dollars from Argentina’s harvest season, made it harder for the monetary authority to buy dollars to rebuild its scarce hard currency reserves without weakening the peso, which Milei was keen to avoid. “In Argentina, anyone who understands the tricks of the market can make profits that don’t exist in other parts of the world, at the expense of draining the central bank,” said Salvador Vitelli, head of research at local financial consultancy Romano Group. The IMF’s Much-Ignored Role What the FT doesn’t mention is the role the IMF keeps playing in facilitating the capital flight that inevitably follows. After the Milei government’s easing of capital controls in April, as part of the bailout agreement reached with the IMF, $5.3 billion of foreign exchange currency left the country in just six weeks. That was the equivalent of 44% of the IMF’s first $12 billion disbursement of funds. That money gets added to Argentina’s already unpayable debt load even though it does nothing to benefit the country. The exact same thing happened in 2018. This is why bailing out Argentina is such a high risk move: much, if not all, of the money will be used for financial speculation, and it will promptly leave the country. Given the cloud of controversy surrounding the proposed rescue package, the Trump administration and the Milei government are trying to come up with a joint strategy for preventing opposition parties in their respective parliaments from blocking it. From Infobae: The U.S. Congress would not have explicit powers to block the bailout of Argentina, but the Democratic caucus in the Senate is exploring legal precedents aimed at breaking the agreement negotiated by Caputo and Bessent. In any case, by the Mexican Debt Disclosure Act approved in 1995, Trump and Bessent must report to Capitol Hill on the financial bailout for Argentina. It’s also worth keeping in mind the respective backgrounds of the two chief negotiators of the bailout: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a former hedge fund manager who is more used to demolishing currencies than saving them; and Argentina’s Economy Minister Luis Caputo, a former JPM Chase banker who already drove Argentina into default once before, in 2018. If consummated, this will be the third bailout for the Argentine economy under his tutelage. Wall Street's minions meet: "Populist" Trump named billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary. Argentina's corrupt "populist" leader Milei named JPMorgan stock/bond trader Luis Caputo as minister of economy. Right-wing "populism" is a Wall Street scam. https://t.co/xuxexpS3Uu — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) October 7, 2025 As Washington mobilises all this money to keep its most important client state in South America afloat, there is one obvious precondition: Milei’s party must achieve a strong enough showing in the upcoming mid-terms by expanding his tiny share of seats in congress and demonstrating enough popular support to win over potential allies in the centrist opposition. Only that way will he be able to continue governing by veto and decree. From Bloomberg: For now, the most popular base case scenario is that the government gets between 34% and 37% of the vote in the next election, Barclays economist Ivan Stambulsky said in a report to investors last week. Under these circumstances, it is expected that Milei will be able to continue governing by veto and decree. That is looking increasingly unlikely. Milei’s approval ratings are dropping like a stone. According to a poll published on Sunday by Zuban Córdoba, 65% of the population now disapprove of the president’s leadership — no great surprise given the state of the economy and the proliferation of political scandals, many directly involving Milei and his inner circle. Milei is unrepentant on the economy, blaming instead the “orcs” in opposition for all the problems. As I say, things are getting seriously surreal. From Politica Argentina: “The economy was recovering until the orcs began to break everything,” the president said, pointing to opposition sectors. “There is still a long way to go, but we are going in the right direction. We are halfway there. Let’s make the effort worthwhile. They left us a minefield full of bombs. Fixing that is not easy. It involves sacrifice and pain.” Milei accused the opposition of trying to “torpedo” the economic course since the beginning of the year: “Since February, March they have been torpedoing all the time and that generates a situation where the markets today are not working in the way they should normally do.” The head of state asked for confidence in his political project and assured that “Argentines are going to vote for hope and they will not want to return to the past.” He also proposed a growth horizon: “If we continue on this path, in 10 years we will be like Spain, in 20 years like Germany, in 30 like the United States and in 40 we will be among the top three countries with the highest incomes.” In other words, the government needs just one more bailout and then the “miracle” can continue. The delusional thinking is on such a scale that it reminds me of Robin Williams’ roasting of Wall Street’s liquidity-hooked bankers in the wake of the subprime crisis. “The Ship Is Leaking” After spending much of the past 22 months lauding Milei’s economic experiment, which is nothing more than an extreme version of neoliberalism, the international financial press finally appear to be losing faith. Spain’s El Economista, until recently one of Milei’s biggest cheerleaders, has admitted that Milei’s economic “miracle” is floundering. The Financial Times has published a piece by Ciara Nugent warning that “Argentines are losing patience with the economy” after nearly two years of fiscal adjustment and growing social unrest over the effects of the austerity plan and the non-stop corruption scandals splattering the Milei government. It does not paint a pretty picture of the on-the-ground economic reality: La Plata business owners said their clients were running low on cash. “People have been paying for bread with credit cards,” said Pablo Miró, who runs a bakery. “Inflation has come down, but I’m seeing more inequality.” Belén Aguilar said she was closing her chocolate shop, which opened in 2022, because of falling consumer demand. “Sales fell about 50 per cent this year,” she said. “It’s no longer sustainable to keep the physical store.” Economists say Milei’s singular focus on lowering inflation, which has been the scourge of Argentina’s economy for the past decade, has weighed on activity. On Sunday, the Wall Street Journal published a scathing op-ed by Mary Anastasia O’Grady on Milei’s economic record, titled “Time for Milei to Stop Passing the Buck”: President Javier Milei promised to liberate Argentina from the grip of a privileged establishment he calls the “caste”—and to dollarize. The 2023 election was a referendum on both. He won. But now he’s working to rescue the peso regime… The latest peso rout came despite assurances from the U.S. Treasury that it is prepared to negotiate a $20 billion swap line for Argentina. The U.S. also said it might buy Argentine debt and use its Exchange Stabilization Fund to provide standby credit. But on those proposals Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was less clear. That prompted Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo to fly to Washington Friday. The peso has stopped sinking—for now. The trigger for the midweek selloff seems to have been the Argentine central bank’s Tuesday decision to restrict the purchase of dollars at the official—overvalued—peso rate. That was an admission that reserves in the bank’s vault were running low. The central bank had tightened capital controls the week before. It didn’t help. Neither did the temporary suspension of export taxes for grain dealers, which generated dollar inflows but didn’t fatten the bank’s war chest because there was also lots of peso selling. The timing of all this couldn’t be worse for Mr. Milei. In three weeks his Liberty Advances coalition faces the Oct. 26 midterm congressional elections. A weak showing could leave him with a Peronist supermajority in the new legislature. The Peronist coalition’s voting record in Congress demonstrates that given the chance, it will happily demolish the fiscal discipline that Mr. Milei has worked hard to achieve. It’s possible that at least some U.S. aid will arrive before the midterms. But the International Monetary Fund and U.S. government want Argentina to boost its reserves. Instead the ship is leaking. ‘This is all despite US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s pledge a couple of weeks ago to do whatever is needed to save the Argentine economy and currency.’ Alex Christoforou was saying the other day that Bessent is starting to back away from that pledge. Maybe he is realizing that Argentina under Milei is simply not salvageable. Milie is going to run Argentina into the ground, fly out of the country to a place like Florida with his bags of money, and then blame everybody else for what went wrong with Argentina. And you know what? Trump will welcome him at the White House and greet him as a misunderstood patriot. That was a few days ago, Rev, and it was in response to all the criticism at home. But I don’t think Washington can walk away from this one so easily given the huge amount of debt Argentina owes the IMF (over $50 billion). Yesterday the US Treasury began buying Argentine pesos in the currency markets. Bessent posted the following text on Twitter yesterday: The @USTreasury has concluded 4 days of intensive meetings with Minister @LuisCaputoAR and his team in DC. We discussed Argentina’s strong economic fundamentals, including structural changes already underway that will generate significant dollar-denominated exports and foreign exchange reserves. Argentina faces a moment of acute illiquidity. The international community – including @IMFNews – is unified behind Argentina and its prudent fiscal strategy, but only the United States can act swiftly. And act we will. To that end, today we directly purchased Argentine pesos. Additionally, we have finalized a $20 billion currency swap framework with Argentina’s central bank. The U.S. Treasury is prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability to markets. I emphasized to Minister Caputo that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump’s America First economic leadership is committed to strengthening our allies who welcome fair trade and American investment. I continue to hear from American business leaders who, thanks to President Milei’s leadership, are eager to tie the American and Argentine economies more closely together. The Trump administration is resolute in our support for allies of the United States, and to that end we also discussed Argentina’s investment incentives, and U.S. tools to powerfully support investment in our strategic partners. Minister Caputo informed me of his close coordination with the IMF on Argentina’s commitments under its program. Argentina’s policies, when anchored on fiscal discipline, are sound. Its exchange rate band remains fit for purpose. We reviewed the broad political consensus in Argentina for the second half of President @JMilei’s term. I was encouraged by their focus on achieving fiscally sound economic freedom for the people of Argentina via lower taxes, higher investment, private sector job creation, and partnering with allies. As Argentina lifts the dead weight of the state and stops spending into inflation, great things are possible. The success of Argentina’s reform agenda is of systemic importance, and a strong, stable Argentina which helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in the strategic interest of the United States. Their success should be a bipartisan priority. I look forward to the meeting between President Trump and President Milei on October 14, and to seeing Minister Caputo again on the margins of the IMF Annual Meetings. Thanks for the clarification, Nick. Until recently I labelled the Ukraine as Trump’s tar baby that would drag him down. Never did I think that he would voluntarily get into a second tar baby in Argentina. That was never on my bingo card in the first half of the year. Bonus points because he is also sending Israel about a billion dollars or more a month. So they’re going to lend $20 billion so Argentina (apparently very lacking in the argent department – the irony!) can pay back the $50 billion it owes to the IMF. Who knew that Treasury was so into check kiting? :-] The $20 bn will actually go straight to the carry trade; its shelf life in the Argentina Central Bank’s (BCRA) reserves will, like previous cash injections, last less than one of those tiktok thingies. It will pass right through to the speculators. That is why Caputo went back to the US so fast. It goes out as fast as it comes in. In that regard, I do not understand all the crocodile tears about the US having to put up couch lint (see Pentagon, budget of) so that it can enable rich investors to continue private looting of public resources. I mean, after all, the 20 bn will: 1. Supplant the Chinese swap currently place in BCRA; 2. Come with conditions such as pawning national resources and expanding US military presence; 3. Eventually be repaid not by the carry traders but by Argentine people who must to have hospitals, schools, infrastructure, salaries cut, because ‘debts must be honoured’. It is the Argentine people who will repay the IMF the 50bn + much more. Sounds like a win-win-win. Sure I understand how this facility might be used as an excuse domestically in the US (an excuse, nothing more) to cut US services, but since when are we really going to fall for the loanshark’s sob story? Anarcho-capitalist sounds like an euphemism for someone that implements stand and deliver policy. Anarcho-capitalism = Smash and Grab. Thank you Nick for this very detailed and informative post. It demonstrates once again – as if anyone needed another example – of what happens when countries remove all barriers to unfettered global capital. One would also hope that such examples demonstrate the utter hypocrisy of Trump’s “anti-globalist” label to what’s left of the MAGA faithful. But that is probably too much to wish for. Maybe clips of Milei singing Hava Nagila will have an effect. It’s insane that Trump wants to spend billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out Milei, Israel, farmers (due to his tariffs), financier cronies or his own family. Never mind the Peace Prize. He seems to rapidly be on the way to the Most Corrupt President in History prize. Will no one in DC object? Don’t worry, Milei will turn out just fine. I can guarantee that all of his Libertarian and Austrian economics fan boys will come out in force to defend him. Remember, their politics cannot be failed, it must be the rest of the world sabotaging/not allowing their success. The lesson here is that no matter how much you are fed up with with the traditional political castes, a libertarian populist like Milei (or Trump) is not exactly a solution. I wonder if there is any kind of political solution available anywhere. What a fabulous money laundering scam! High class indeed. It’s the simple Shell Game, but this cast of characters is world-class. The rules of this Shell Game are enforced by the US Court of the Southern District of New York under US contract law. Forgive the metaphor, but Argentina is like a zombie body that keeps on giving to the American vulture funds. They have it down to a science, and now they have conned the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve into directly flooding the zone with debt and dollars. Absolutely astonishing levels of greed and criminality. Two hundred grand to Espert? A chump-ass if I ever saw one…and he will end up under the bus. It’s so validating to see Milei fall after so many libertarians online were so confident in him being elected. Also, I really do wonder if Trump and friends have their hands in the international drug trades with their connections and reading about the cocaine trafficking connections here. I wouldn’t be surprised if him and Epstein had other types of organized crimes going on. Milei conned the Argentine voters much like Trump. They were elected on a set of clearly defined mandates and they have used it to enrich themselves and their friends. Scammers! 😤 Both did crypto scam, so they are beyond regular political scammers. Very true 💯 Can’t believe some of the highest elected representatives in the world are scammers! 🤯 Whose idea was it to revive the peso? Why not go all in on USD and being a US vassal, it would’ve turned out better than this 💩 show. Your email address will not be published.
