BSE Stocks Today, BSE Share Price Live news & updates 2nd Apr 2025: Shares of BSE Ltd are in focus today.

The company will inform the record date for determining the entitlement in due course, according to a stock exchange filing. Track live updates here Track live updates Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a recovery rally, with the Nifty ends 167 points higher while the Sensex was up by 593 points. Among sectors, most of the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the Realty index outperformed, rallying over 3.35 percent. Technically, on intraday charts, after a muted opening, the market found support near 23150/76000 and reversed. Following this reversal, it maintained positive momentum throughout the day. Additionally, it formed a bullish candle on daily charts, supporting a further uptrend. We believe that as long as the market is trading above 23150/76000, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the upside, it could move up to 23500/77000. A dismissal of 23500/77000 could push the market towards 23650/77500. Conversely, if the market falls below 23150/76000, selling pressure may intensify, and it could slip to the 23000-22950/75500-75300 range. - Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities Top gainers on the NSE: Tata Consumer Products, Zomato, Titan, IndusInd and Tech Mahindra Top losers: BEL, Nestle India, UltraTech, Bajaj Finserv, Power Grid Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty Kundra, offering natural protection for children.

Bharat Dynamics (BDL) has achieved turnover of over ₹3300 crore (Provisional & Unaudited) during the FY 2024-25, against the previous year’s turnover of ₹2,369 crore registering a record growth of around 40%. BDL shares soared 3.83% on the NSE to ₹1,292.90. ING FX Strategist, Francesco Pesole, comments ahead of Trump’s anticipated tariffs on ‘liberation day’: “Media reports have suggested that Trump is planning a 20% tariff on most US imports, roughly equating to $660bn in expected revenues when taking the 3.3tr as a reference value for US imports. But it’s also been reported that a tiered system with different rates or a customised approach is being considered. Expectations are also that some sensitive sectors can be excluded to minimise the impact on US producers and consumers. There is an open question of whether new tariffs will be added to existing ones on autos and metals or if only the highest tariff rate will be in place. “The second layer of FX impact will depend on the geographical distribution of tariffs. Markets may be taking the 20% flat rate as a baseline, which can generate a stronger dollar reaction across the board, but the details of country-specific and product-specific duties should determine how single currencies will behave in the crosses. We still think European currencies are facing greater downside risks in this sense. Finally, the US administration’s tone on negotiation room will be a key factor for market reaction. “We have seen some sharp outperformance of AUD, NZD, NOK and CAD overnight as a flat tariff as opposed to case-specific reciprocal tariffs is seen as slightly more lenient and crucially less unpredictable. Our view remains that downside risks dominate for all currencies against the dollar today. The US may try to announce the harsher measures today before eventually scaling it back, which may still force a positioning rotation into USD and JPY with high beta currencies taking the bigger hit. But dollar outperformance today will not be indicative of more sustainable strengthening. Time will be needed to assess how long tariffs will remain in place: alongside US data releases (watch ADP payrolls today), that will determine the USD outlook. We still favour USD appreciation beyond today’s event, but it will hardly be a smooth ride.” SAR Televenture Limited, a leading network infrastructure company listed on NSE, has announced that its Board has approved the share swap for acquisition of a majority stake in Tikona Infinet Limited, a prominent internet service provider, for a total consideration of ₹578 crore.
