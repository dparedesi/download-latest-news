Stocks closed sharply down on Thursday as investors digested a wave of economic uncertainty, including tariff tensions, inflation data, and a string of downbeat corporate signals. The Nasdaq sank 4.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 3.5% and the Dow fell 2.5%. The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, slid 4%. Big Tech led the losses: Apple fell more than 4%, Amazon dropped over 5%, and Tesla slumped more than 7%. Used-car retailer CarMax was one of the day’s biggest losers, closing down 17% after a disappointing earnings report and broader concerns about the auto sector. Looking ahead, Friday will bring a wave of bank earnings, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others set to report — offering fresh insight into credit conditions and consumer resilience. Investors will also parse new economic data, including producer price inflation figures, for clues about the path of interest rates. Markets fell sharply Thursday, giving back a big chunk of Wednesday’s huge rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,693 points in early-afternoon trading, or about 4.2%, after its historic 3,000-point surge the day before, The S&P 500 fell 4.9%, and the Nasdaq dropped 5.7%, with shares of the Magnificent Seven tech giants leading the retreat: Apple (AAPL+3.96%) stock slid 6%, Tesla (TSLA-1.87%) dropped 10%, and Amazon (AMZN+1.49%) fell more than 6.5%. Shopify (SHOP-1.54%) stock tumbled more than 9%. Used car stocks were hit especially hard after CarMax’s earnings miss, with CarMax stock down almost 20% and Carvana (CVNA-0.17%) off 10%. The pullback reflects lingering skepticism around President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs, which arrived even more abruptly than the trade war policy itself. Markets seem reluctant to trust a policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as inflation data offered some welcome relief. The Consumer Price Index showed that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March, the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax’s (KMX+2.23%) fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts’ expectations of $0.66 per share. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025’s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+4.46%) will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins — the critical metrics that show how it’s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment. Any signs of tightening credit or weakening consumer demand could ripple across the market. Wells Fargo’s (WFC-0.93%) numbers will offer a window into consumer lending, where even small shifts in behavior can signal broader household strain. With recession chatter back on the table, analysts are looking for clues about how the bank is adjusting its exposure. Asset manager BlackRock (BLK+2.69%) will report amid surging volatility and massive swings in investor sentiment. Its earnings should reveal whether clients are retreating into cash or leaning into risk — and where the big money is flowing. Morgan Stanley (MS+1.96%) will round out the Friday slate, with attention on investment banking fees and deal activity. With M&A pipelines reportedly thinning and IPOs still scarce, the results could help gauge the depth of Wall Street’s current dealmaking drought.

Big bank stocks rebounded from earlier declines Wednesday after President Donald Trump said he would pause "reciprocal" import taxes for 90 days. Earlier Wednesday, bank shares had fallen as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy could be headed toward a recession as Trump's tariffs rattled markets. "I think probably it's a likely outcome," Dimon said in a televised appearance on Fox Business' "Mornings with Maria." Just after 1:15 p.m. ET, however, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would pause most tariffs effective immediately, causing stocks to soar. Shares of JPMorgan were up 8% in recent trading, while Bank of America (BAC) stock rose 6%, and Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) shares jumped 7% and 9%, respectively. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) Several major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, are set to report quarterly earnings on Friday, with investors likely to be watching whether worries about tariffs are hampering clients' borrowing appetites and ability to repay loans. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

March inflation data and Big Bank earnings are among the major items on this week’s economic calendar as investors look for signals about what's next for markets following a chaotic end to last week. Friday ended a two-day run that will end up in the history books, the major US indexes logging their biggest weekly declines since the start of the Covid pandemic. Investors are now seeking clues for what might be next on prices and economic health following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which is expected to take effect Wednesday. China announced 34% retaliatory tariffs that are scheduled to begin on Thursday. Investopedia's live coverage of Monday's trading can be read here. What else is on tap? Friday earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BlackRock (BLK) are among the financial institutions on the calendar. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and CarMax (KMX) also are scheduled to deliver earnings earlier in the week. Federal Reserve meeting minutes are expected to provide insight into economic conditions and the path of interest rates. Data on consumer sentiment and credit levels will be closely watched amid uncertainty over inflation and tariffs. Monday, April 7 Tuesday, April 8 Wednesday, April 9 Thursday, April 10 Friday, April 11 March inflation data will be in the spotlight as market participants keep an eye on prices in the wake of President Trump’s sprawling tariffs, which are expected to take effect on Wednesday, reigniting recession fears. Economists at Wells Fargo expected the Consumer Price Index to remain unchanged in March, with that data’s scheduled release for Thursday. The sideways movement comes as inflation has edged lower recently, including a steeper-than-expected decrease in February’s CPI reading. Inflation has been a key reason cited by Federal Reserve officials for keeping interest rates at their current levels. Wednesday’s scheduled release of the minutes from the Fed’s most recent March meeting will provide more insight into how current economic conditions are affecting the way that central bankers view interest rate levels. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for March will give investors more information about prices at the wholesale level, potentially feeding into consumer prices down the line. Investors are also expecting data on wholesale inventory levels on Wednesday. Another key inflation measurement will come in Friday’s scheduled release of consumer sentiment data, which will include consumer price expectations that can have an influence on the direction of inflation. Consumer and business sentiment has also been closely watched after Trump’s tariffs policy has raised worries over price increases and worsening economic conditions. Small business sentiment is expected to come on Tuesday as recent surveys have shown that business owners are also starting to sour on the economy. Big Banks will lead off the latest earnings season with a slew of scheduled reports later this week, giving investors their first look at first-quarter earnings. Analysts will be watching to see if banks can continue to drive growth in areas like investment banking and net interest income. JPMorgan Chase is expected to kick off a string of reports from financial firms with its earnings report Friday, coming after the world’s largest bank by market capitalization delivered a surprising jump in profits last quarter. JPMorgan grew its investment banking revenue while its net interest income also increased. BlackRock’s announcement scheduled the same day comes after the firm posted a record quarter for assets under management. Investors likely will be listening for updates on Blackrock’s $30 billion AI infrastructure funding project with Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Elon Musk’s xAI and other firms. Wells Fargo’s scheduled Friday report comes as its net income topped analyst estimates but the bank just missed its revenue target last quarter. Before Friday’s financial services reports, Delta Air Lines’ scheduled report on Wednesday comes as the carrier has lowered its projections for the quarter on weakening travel demand amid economic uncertainty. The lowered outlook came after Delta reported a profitable prior quarter on stronger sales of premium offerings. Levi Strauss has also warned that macroeconomic conditions could hurt its 2025 sales, with the jeans makers’ quarterly report scheduled for Monday. Egg seller Cal-Maine’s scheduled report on Tuesday comes amid interest in prices for that food stock, becoming a symbol in the battle against inflation and a political talking point. But Cal-Maine has benefited from increased demand for eggs amid a bird flu outbreak, posting better-than-expected results in the previous quarter due in part to higher egg prices. Other noteworthy reports this week include Rust-Oleum maker RPM International on Tuesday, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands on Wednesday, and online car seller CarMax on Thursday.
