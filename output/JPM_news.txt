Good morning. Earnings season is underway. JPMorgan Chase reported fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on Tuesday, with investors looking past solid headline results to focus on higher expected costs and a one-time reserve tied to the Apple Card deal, sending shares modestly lower. The bank posted net income of $13 billion, down 7% from a year earlier due to a $2.2 billion pre-tax credit reserve build related to its pending acquisition of the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. Revenue rose 7% to $46.8 billion, while net interest income climbed 7% to $25.1 billion, driven by higher revolving credit card balances and improved deposit margins. Morningstar Director Sean Dunlop wrote in a note on Tuesday that as the first bank to report results and the largest bank in the U.S., JPMorgan’s earnings serve as “a barometer of consumer, corporate, and financial system health.” He added that JPMorgan’s “broad-based revenue growth suggests all three remain in good shape, though management’s tone and excess reserves point to a cautious outlook beyond 2026.” Dunlop raised his fair value estimate for JPM shares to $289 from $259, while still viewing the stock as expensive. CFO Jeremy Barnum said on the earnings call that consumers and small businesses remain resilient. JPMorgan projected 2026 expenses of about $105 billion, with Barnum describing the increase as a function of structural optimism and the need to invest to stay ahead. “More generally, the environment is only getting more competitive, and so it remains critical to ensure that we are making the necessary investments to secure our position against both traditional and non-traditional competitors,” he explained. During the Q&A session, CEO Jamie Dimon said higher spending, including on technology and AI, is necessary to compete with fintechs such as Revolut and SoFi, as well as established financial firms like Charles Schwab. “These are good players,” Dimon said to analysts on the call. “We analyze what they do and how they do it… We are going to stay out front — so help us God. We’re not going to try to meet some expense target and then 10 years from now you’d be asking us the question, ‘How did JPMorgan get left behind?’” Barnum also warned that President Donald Trump’s proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% would likely reduce access to credit rather than help consumers, arguing that intense competition already compresses margins and that price controls would force broad lending cutbacks — especially for higher-risk borrowers. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Betsabe Botaitis was appointed CFO of P2P.org, a non-custodial institutional staking provider. Botaitis brings over 20 years of leadership across financial services, fintech, and Web3, with experience building governance and operations in high-growth organizations. Most recently, Botaitis served as CFO and treasurer at Hedera. Botaitis' career spans both traditional financial institutions and crypto-native organizations. She began in retail banking before holding senior finance roles at Citigroup and LendingClub, and later co-founding and serving as CFO of a blockchain company. Julie Feder was appointed CFO of Obsidian Therapeutics, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company. Feder brings over 20 years of strategic finance experience in life sciences and health care. Feder joins Obsidian from Aura Biosciences, where she served as CFO for six years. Before Aura, she was CFO at Verastem. Before that, Feder spent six years at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc., as CFO. Global law firm Hogan Lovells has published its Employment Horizons for 2026 report. The firm analyzes the most pressing issues impacting employers worldwide. This year's report examines emerging developments such as new rules on AI and data use in the workplace, shifting protections for vulnerable workers, evolving pay transparency requirements, changes to working time and family‑friendly policies, and renewed scrutiny of non‑compete agreements. AI is speeding up a big change in the job market: instead of hiring mainly for job titles, employers are increasingly hiring for skills, according to a new report. Wharton and Accenture created the Wharton-Accenture Skills Index (WAsX), a regular, data-based measure that shows which skills are valuable, which are not, and how fast these priorities are changing over time. In the report, an analysis finds that generalist skills like communication and leadership are oversupplied, while technical, analytical, and execution-focused skills remain scarce. Another finding is that skills have price tags—but value is contextual. For example, “strategic analysis” is linked to an $8,000 increase in annual pay for sales representatives, but a $10,000 decrease for validation engineers. AI is reducing demand for routine cognitive work (writing, basic analysis) while increasing demand for operations, compliance, and judgment-based skills. "Companies like ours think in terms of occasions because, simply, that’s when we do our business — when people come together, it’s often a moment for a tall, frosty beer, whether with or without alcohol." —Rahul Goyal, president and CEO of Molson Coors Beverage Company, writes in a Fortune opinion piece.

Stock futures are lower this morning as investors digest earnings reports and await key inflation data; JPMorgan's fourth-quarter results were mixed, as profits and net interest income topped estimates while revenue fell short; consumer price data for December is due out this morning; Delta shares are falling after the airline issued a disappointing outlook; and President Trump is threatening Iran's trading partners with new tariffs over the country's response to recent protests. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are slightly lower as the quarterly earnings season gets underway and investors prepare for the release of inflation data that will be closely monitored by the Federal Reserve. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, each of which closed at record highs on Monday, were down 0.2% recently, while Nasdaq futures slipped 0.3%. Stocks came under pressure early Monday on news that the Department of Justice is investigating Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but rebounded to finish the day slightly higher. Gold futures were down 0.6% at $4,590 an ounce this morning, after hitting a record high around $4,640 on Monday amid concerns about possible threats to the Fed's independence. Crude oil futures were up 1.7% at $60.50 per barrel, trading above $60 for the first time since early December. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked higher to 4.20%, near its highest level in four months. Bitcoin was at $92,000. up from an overnight low of just below $91,000. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the world's largest bank by market capitalization, kicked off a busy week of bank earnings this morning. The bank reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.23 on revenue of $45.8 billion. Analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha had projected adjusted EPS of $4.96 and revenue of $46.07 billion. JPMorgan reported $25.1 billion in net interest income, above what analysts had forecast. "The U.S. economy has remained resilient," CEO Jamie Dimon said. "While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy." Bank stocks sank on Monday after President Donald Trump suggested a cap of 10% on credit card interest rates. During the earnings call this morning, JPMorgan executives are likely to discuss that, as well as a deal announced last week to take over as the backer of Apple's (AAPL) credit card program from Goldman Sachs (GS). JPMorgan shares were little changed in recent premarket trading, after falling more than 1% Monday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release its closely followed Consumer Price Index report at 8:30 a.m ET. Economists on average expect the report to show that consumer prices rose 2.7% in the 12 months through December, unchanged from the month before. "Core" prices, excluding more volatile food and gas prices, are also expected to have risen 2.8%, which would mark an acceleration in inflation after it unexpectedly slowed in November. Inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, and continued signs of price pressures could keep the central bank from cutting its key interest rate again soon. Inflation is generally expected to slow this year as declining housing costs and a lack of wage increases are projected to outweigh the impact of the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs. Delta Air Lines (DAL) stock is slumping in premarket trading after the airline issued a disappointing outlook. Delta said it earned an adjusted $1.55 in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha, while revenue topped estimates at $16 billion. For 2026, however, Delta said it is expecting adjusted EPS of $6.50 to $7.50, with the midpoint of $7.00 well below the $7.26 analysts currently forecast. Analysts had said leading into the report that Delta and other airlines may opt for more cautious outlooks for 2026 after a difficult last few years of operations, and said that the 2026 forecasts will likely be the focus of airline earnings this month rather than the fourth-quarter results. In Tuesday's report, Delta also announced an order of 30 planes from Boeing, the widebody 787-10, with options to purchase another 30, with deliveries expected to start in 2031. Delta shares were down more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. President Trump threatened a new round of tariffs amid the deadly protests in Iran. "Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America," Trump said Monday afternoon on social media. The larger structure of the tariffs are currently unknown, as the White House has yet to release an official order on the tariffs. The tariffs would be in response to a recent wave of anti-government protests in Iran, which has led to the deaths of more than 600 protestors, human rights groups estimate. Trump has threatened to involve the U.S. military if the killings continue, and has encouraged the protests to topple Iran's government, per CNBC. The legality of Trump's current tariffs are also unknown, with a Supreme Court ruling expected in the coming weeks over whether the president had the legal authority to unilaterally declare the tariffs.

Stock futures are losing ground this morning as investors digest news the Trump administration is investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell; the Fed Chair said in a video statement late Sunday that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the Fed and is threatening criminal charges over his Senate testimony regarding the renovation of the Fed building; the uncertainty around potential threats to the Fed's independence is helping to drive gold prices to new record highs; shares of financial services companies are falling after a proposal from President Trump to cap credit card interest rates; and Walmart stock is rising after the retail giant announced a new partnership with Google to integrate Walmart and Sam's Club products into Google's Gemini AI chatbot. Here's what you need to know. Stock futures are pointing to a lower open as investors react to a new wave of uncertainty around the independence of the Federal Reserve. (more below) Futures tied to the S&P 500 were down 0.5% recently, while those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq dropped 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. The Dow and S&P 500 are pulling back ahead of a busy week of earnings reports after closing at record highs to end last week. Gold futures surged to a record high amid the Fed uncertainty, and were recently up more than 2% at around $4,600 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of consumer loans, was at 4.21%, up from 4.17% at Friday's close and trading at its highest level since early September. Bitcoin was at $90,600, down from an overnight high of around $92,300. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement Sunday night that the Fed received grand jury subpoenas from the DOJ on Friday regarding potential criminal charges. The subpoenas are related to Powell's testimony to Congress last year about Fed building renovations that President Trump has criticized Powell for previously. In a video statement, Powell said the investigation is not actually about the renovation. "The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," Powell said. Trump spent months attacking Powell last year for not lowering interest rates as much as he thought they should be lowered, which Trump said was hurting the economy. Powell said Sunday that the outcome of this investigation will determine whether the Fed will maintain its independence and set rates based on economic evidence, or "whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation." Gold prices are surging this morning as investors turn to safe haven investments following the news of the DOJ investigation into Powell. Gold futures were up 2.3% at $4,605 an ounce recently, trading at all-time-high levels. Concerns that the independence of the Fed were among the many factors that helped drive the price of gold to a number of record highs last year. Gold typically does well in times of uncertainty, as investors look to put their money in safer long term assets like gold rather than more volatile investments like stocks. The precious metal was already rising to start the year thanks to renewed geopolitical uncertainty after the Trump administration's military operation in Venezuela and concerns over whether the U.S. could get involved in deadly protests in Iran. Shares of several financial services companies are sliding Monday after President Trump over the weekend suggested that credit card interest rates should be capped. Trump said on social media late Friday that Americans are being "ripped off" by rates of 20% to 30%, and said that effective Jan. 20 he would be calling for a one-year cap of 10%. Why the cap would be one-year long and how the cap would be accomplished remain unclear, but the idea is still affecting shares of credit card companies in premarket trading. Capital One Financial (COF) stock dropped 7%, while Citigroup (C) and American Express (AXP) were each down about 4%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also lost ground. Executives from several of those institutions will get a chance to respond to that idea this week as the big banks kick off the new quarterly earnings season, starting with JPMorgan on Tuesday. Walmart (WMT) shares are rising after the retail giant announced a new partnership with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google over the weekend. Users in the Gemini app will soon start to receive Walmart and Sam's Club products as part of their search results when they ask for things like recommendations for camping equipment. The companies said that customers will be able to navigate from Gemini to Walmart to buy products, and will be able to link their Walmart and Gemini accounts to get recommendations and other benefits. Walmart shares were up more than 3% in recent premarket trading, poised to open at what would be a new record high. The deal is the latest tech-focused step for Walmart, which has worked to implement new tech features in its app and automation across its distribution centers, and even moved its stock listing to the Nasdaq Exchange last month.
