(NYSE AMERICAN: ATNM) Announces Supply Agreement with Eckert & Ziegler for Ac-225 Radioisotope to Support Comprehensive Development Activities – Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Actinium or the Company), a pioneer in the development of targeted radiotherapies, recently announced it has entered into an agreement for the supply of Actinium-225 (Ac-225) with Eckert & Ziegler. Under this agreement, Actinium Pharmaceuticals will have access to Eckert & Ziegler's high-quality Actinium-225 to further develop its lead product Actimab-A as well as additional early and late-stage development candidates for both U.S. and international clinical trials. Targeted radiotherapies using Ac-225 have shown great promise in the treatment of cancer. The radioisotope releases powerful alpha particles with high energy and low penetration depth, enabling precise targeting of tumor cells, including hard-to-reach micrometastases, while minimizing effects on surrounding healthy tissue. Actimab-A is an Ac-225 based radiotherapy agent, directed against CD33, a receptor overexpressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid indications. Sandesh Seth, Chairman and CEO at Actium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. commented: "We believe that targeted radiation therapy with Actinium-225 is one of the most promising approaches for treating patients with myeloid malignancies and solid tumors. As we have highlighted recently, we are advancing our lead targeted radiotherapy Actimab-A into a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and in the frontline setting in a Phase 1 trial under our CRADA with the NCI. Additionally, we have launched our Actimab-A solid tumor program to combine with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO for patients with head and neck squamous carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer in multiple trials. As a pioneer in the development of target radiotherapies, we have aggressive plans to expand our clinical pipeline to address indications with high unmet needs. With this supply agreement with Eckert & Ziegler, we will have access to reliable and constant supply of Ac-225 to advance our product development both in the U.S. as well as internationally." "We are happy to contribute to the continuous expansion of indications for Actinium-225, which is significantly being advanced by Actinium Pharmaceuticals," explained Dr. Harald Hasselmann, CEO of Eckert & Ziegler SE. "The progress we have made in our Ac-225 project over the past year marks only the start of our program to address the global shortage of this vital radionuclide." Eckert & Ziegler reliably supplies high-quality Gallium-68, Lutetium-177, Yttrium-90, and Actinium-225 to leading pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions worldwide. With expertise in radioisotope production and global logistics, the company is committed to continuously support the development and delivery of innovative radiopharmaceuticals.

New results show Eli Lilly and Company's (NYSE: LLY) EBGLYSS achieved deep and sustained response for patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) at three years. These findings from the ADjoin long-term extension study will be presented at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, taking place March 7-11 in Orlando. EBGLYSS is an interleukin-13 (IL-13) inhibitor that selectively blocks IL-13 signaling with high binding affinity. The cytokine IL-13 is a primary cytokine in atopic dermatitis, driving the type-2 inflammatory cycle in the skin, leading to skin barrier dysfunction, itch, skin thickening and infection. Novartis AG (NYSE: NVS) recently announced that oral Fabhalta® (iptacopan) has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of adults with C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), to reduce proteinuria, making it the first and only treatment approved for this condition.

"This approval of Fabhalta is historic for the entire C3G community as now, for the first time, we have a therapy that is believed to treat the underlying cause of the disease, providing the potential for a new standard of care for patients." AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ: AZN) - New study results presented at the European Lung Cancer Congress (ELCC) 2025, March 26 to 29, demonstrate the role of AstraZeneca’s TAGRISSO® (osimertinib), as monotherapy and as the backbone for novel combinations, across stages and settings of epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Highlights include: Myung-Ju Ahn, MD, PhD, Professor of Hemato-Oncology at the Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea, said: "A critical goal in treating every patient with lung cancer is to not only extend a patient's life but also maintain quality of life while on treatment. The continued overall survival trend seen here at ELCC in the unresectable Stage III setting and the promising data for combinations that can address progression in the advanced setting, together reinforce osimertinib as an effective, safe and convenient treatment for patients with EGFR-mutated lung cancer across stages and lines of treatment."
