Alphabet (GOOGL-1.08%) is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Tuesday. The Google parent’s stock was up by around 2.2% during mid-day trading on Friday. Alphabet shares are up by more than 8% so far this year. The company is expected to report revenues of $96.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS-1.02%). Net income is expected at $26.2 billion, while analysts estimate earnings of $2.13 per share. In December, Google unveiled Gemini 2.0, which it called its most-capable artificial intelligence model to date for the “new agentic era.” AI agents can complete some complex tasks autonomously for a user. Gemini 2.0's multimodal features, such as native image and audio output, “will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,” the company said. With the new AI model’s reasoning capabilities, Google said its AI Overviews feature, which reaches one billion people, will be able to solve advanced multi-step queries, such as mathematical equations and multimodal questions. On Thursday, Google announced the rollout of its Gemini 2.0 Flash model to the Gemini mobile app and website. Meanwhile, Demis Hassabis, founder of Alphabet’s drug discovery subsidiary, Isomorphic Labs, said its AI-designed drugs are expected to head to trial by the end of the year. “AI applied to science is a lot richer than just the language models,” Hassabis, who also serves as chief executive of Google DeepMind, said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We’ll hopefully have some AI-designed drugs in the clinic by the end of the year. That’s the plan.” Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off of DeepMind, announced deals in July to work with Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY+0.01%) and Novartis (NVS+0.78%) on drug research using its AlphaFold AI model.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks swiftly recovered from the DeepSeek-driven sell-off early in the week but came under pressure on Monday amid concerns over President Trump's tariff plans. Trump followed through with his plans on Saturday, placing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4. There will be 25% duties on Canada and Mexico, and 10% on China, over issues of fentanyl and illegal migration. Markets are digesting the tariff announcements after a strong start to the year. In January, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 2.7% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) advanced more than 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 4.7%. In the week ahead, investors will parse the latest developments in Trump's tariff strategy, the January jobs report, and an onslaught of corporate reports. Updates on job openings, as well as activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, will also be on the schedule. Meanwhile, quarterly results from Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Chipotle (CMG), and Eli Lilly (LLY) headline a week that will feature earnings reports from 131 S&P 500 companies. Tariff reaction will be at the forefront of the market narrative in the week ahead. The duties on all three countries will be fully in force by Tuesday, Feb. 4, according to the order signed by Trump on Saturday afternoon in Florida. Many economists have argued that tariffs could stoke inflation. As Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, Canada and Mexico were quick to announce retaliatory measures across a range of US goods. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canada will place 25% counter-tariffs on CAD $155 billion (USD $107 billion) worth of American-made products, starting Tuesday. Stocks are on track for steep losses to start the week, after their rally cooled off on Friday as White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt outlined the plans for imposing tariffs. Trump following through with the extent of tariffs he had initially threatened "may be further" than market participants had been expecting, Evercore ISI chief strategist for international affairs and public policy Sarah Bianci told Yahoo Finance. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as it waits for further clarity on inflation's path toward its 2% target and how potential tariffs could impact that process. The week ahead will bring several key updates for the Fed on the employment side of its mandate. The January jobs report, due out Friday morning, is expected to show the US labor market added 150,000 jobs in the month, down from the 256,000 seen in December. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%. The report will also include revisions to labor data from the past year. "We suspect the January jobs report will continue to indicate the labor market has softened over the past year, but not to an alarming degree," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients Friday. While the labor market has held up for now, with inflation moving slowly toward the Fed's target, some on Wall Street believe signs of significant slowing would be the most likely catalyst to prompt the central bank to resume its rate-cutting cycle. "We think the unemployment rate is probably the single most important macro data point you're going to get every month," Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser told Yahoo Finance. "If you see a significant uptick in the unemployment rate, that potentially puts the Fed under pressure and puts the market under pressure as well." Less than halfway through the reporting period, the S&P 500 is currently pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 13.2% for the fourth quarter, which would mark the fastest rate of growth in three years for the benchmark index. This is higher than the 11.8% growth consensus had expected on Dec. 31, per FactSet data. And FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters points out this reporting season has been a particularly strong one for companies that are surprising Wall Street to the upside with their earnings per share numbers. Analyzing the two days leading into and following a report, companies that beat Wall Street's earnings expectations have seen their stocks rise 1.5% on average. This is above the five-year average of a 1% rise for companies that top earnings estimates. And it's not just this quarter's earnings surprising, either. Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha pointed out in a note to clients that at this point in the quarter, earnings estimates would usually have been cut 1.3%. Instead, they've only been trimmed by 0.6%. In other words, while noise about tariffs, inflation, and the overall path of monetary policy continues to dominate the discussion, the strong trend in earnings continues to be what's keeping Wall Street strategists bullish about the market outlook. "The most steady part of this bull market has been ... those earnings trends. Those forward earnings estimates every week are making new highs," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. "All in all, we think the bull market trend is intact, supported by these earnings that are somewhat still underappreciated." Another bullish sign for earnings may soon be flashing green too. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its ISM Manufacturing PMI. The reading has shown the sector in contraction for more than two years. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave believes the tide may be turning for manufacturing, though. "The manufacturing recession might be over, and we think the ISM manufacturing index is likely to break above 50 in January," Bhave wrote in a note to clients on Friday. This could be bullish for stocks, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee recently said in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook. "To me, the most important chart to watch is the ISM manufacturing turning up in 2025," Lee said. "This series has been below 50 for 26 months now, the longest stretch since 1989-1991, and we think [it] signals an acceleration of cyclical [earnings] growth in 2025." As Lee's chart shows, when ISM's manufacturing PMI picks up, earnings usually follow.
